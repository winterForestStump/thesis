    "content": "Item 1. BUSINESS\nUnless the context otherwise requires, we, us, our, WestRock and the Company refer to WestRock Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and its partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries.\nGeneral \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWestRock is a multinational provider of sustainable fiber-based paper and packaging solutions. We partner with our customers to provide differentiated, sustainable paper and packaging solutions that help them win in the marketplace. Our team members support customers around the world from our operating and business locations in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia.\nWe report our financial results of operations in four reportable segments: Corrugated Packaging, Consumer Packaging, Global Paper and Distribution. See Note 8. Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOn December 1, 2022, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 67.7% interest in Gondi, S.A. de C.V. (Grupo Gondi) for $969.8 million in cash and the assumption of debt (Mexico Acquisition). We accounted for this acquisition as a business combination resulting in its consolidation. See Note 3. Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition, in fiscal 2023, we divested our interior partitions converting operations (our ownership interest in RTS Packaging, LLC), sold our Chattanooga, TN uncoated recycled paperboard mill, sold our ownership interest in an unconsolidated displays joint venture, sold our Seven Hills Paperboard LLC (Seven Hills) mill joint venture in Lynchburg, VA, and sold our Eaton, IN, and Aurora, IL uncoated recycled paperboard mills. See Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Description of Business of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTransaction Agreement with Smurfit Kappa\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOn September 12, 2023, we entered into a transaction agreement (the Transaction Agreement) with Smurfit Kappa Group plc, a public limited company incorporated in Ireland (Smurfit Kappa), Cepheidway Limited (to be renamed Smurfit WestRock plc), a private limited company incorporated in Ireland (ListCo), and Sun Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of ListCo (Merger Sub).\nThe Transaction Agreement provides, among other things, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, that (a) pursuant to a scheme of arrangement (the Scheme) each issued ordinary share of Smurfit Kappa will be exchanged for one ordinary share of ListCo (a ListCo Share), as a result of which Smurfit Kappa will become a wholly owned subsidiary of ListCo, and (b) following the implementation of the Scheme, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the Merger and, together with the Scheme, the Transaction), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of ListCo. As a result of the Merger, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the Common Stock), with certain exceptions, will be converted into the right to receive one ListCo Share and $5.00 in cash. All shares owned by the Company, any Company subsidiary, Smurfit Kappa, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor. The Transaction Agreement also provides a mechanism for converting outstanding Company equity awards to ListCo awards. The Transaction is expected to close in the second calendar quarter of 2024, conditional upon regulatory approvals, shareholder approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions.\nFollowing completion of the Transaction, former Smurfit Kappa shareholders are expected to hold approximately 50.4% of ListCo and our former stockholders are expected to hold approximately 49.6% of ListCo, respectively, based on the number of shares outstanding of both Smurfit Kappa and WestRock as of September 12, 2023. It is further expected that the ListCo shares will be (i) registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and (ii) listed on the Standard Listing segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and admitted to trading on the main market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Shares of our Common Stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act.\nProducts\nWe are one of the largest integrated producers of linerboard, white-top linerboard and corrugating medium (containerboard) and kraft paper in North America, and we serve primarily corrugated packaging markets. We are one of the largest producers of paperboard in North America, and we operate both integrated virgin and recycled fiber mills. Our mill system manufactures for the benefit of each reportable segment that ultimately sells the associated paper and packaging products to our external customers. Additionally, our recycling operations are conducted as a procurement function, focusing on the procurement of low cost, high quality recycled fiber for our mill system. See Item 2. Properties for additional information on our annual production capacity and types of containerboard and paperboard we manufacture, and Item 1. Business - Sales and Marketing for additional information on our vertical integration.\nCorrugated Packaging Segment\nOur Corrugated Packaging segment substantially consists of our integrated corrugated converting operations and generates its revenues primarily from the sale of corrugated containers and other corrugated products including displays. Corrugated packaging is used to provide protective packaging for shipment and distribution of food, paper, health and beauty, and other household, consumer, commercial and industrial products. Corrugated packaging may also be graphically enhanced for retail sale, particularly in club store locations. Our integrated corrugated packaging system manufactures primarily containerboard, corrugated sheets, corrugated packaging and preprinted linerboard for sale to consumer and industrial products manufacturers and corrugated box manufacturers. We produce a wide range of high-quality corrugated containers designed to protect, ship, store, promote and display products made to our customers specifications. We convert corrugated sheets into corrugated products ranging from one-color protective cartons to graphically brilliant point-of-purchase packaging. Our corrugated container plants serve local customers and regional and large national accounts. We provide customers with innovative packaging solutions to help them promote and sell their products. We provide structural and graphic design, engineering services and custom, proprietary and standard automated packaging machines, offering customers turn-key installation, automation, line integration and packaging solutions. We offer a machinery solution that creates pouches that replace single-use plastics, including bubble mailers. To make corrugated sheet stock, we feed linerboard and corrugating medium into a corrugator that flutes the medium to specified sizes, glues the linerboard and fluted medium together, and slits and cuts the resulting corrugated paperboard into sheets to customer specifications.\nWe design, manufacture and, in certain cases, pack temporary displays for sale to consumer products companies and retailers. These displays are used as marketing tools to support new product introductions and specific product promotions in mass merchandising stores, supermarkets, convenience stores, home improvement stores and other retail locations. We also design, manufacture and, in some cases, pre-assemble permanent displays for these customers. We make temporary displays primarily from corrugated paperboard. Unlike temporary displays, permanent displays are restocked with our customers product; therefore, they are constructed primarily from metal, plastic, wood and other durable materials. We manufacture and distribute point of sale material utilizing litho, screen and digital printing technologies. We manufacture lithographic laminated packaging for sale to our customers that require packaging with high quality graphics and strength characteristics.\nSales of corrugated packaging products to external customers accounted for 48.1%, 42.3% and 43.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 8. Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for additional information.\nConsumer Packaging Segment\nOur Consumer Packaging segment consists of our integrated consumer converting operations and generates its revenues primarily from the sale of consumer packaging products such as folding cartons, interior partitions (before divestiture in September 2023), inserts and labels. We are one of the largest manufacturers of folding cartons in North America. Our folding cartons are used to package items such as food, paper, beverages, dairy products, confectionery, health and beauty and other household consumer, commercial and industrial products, primarily for retail sale. Our folding cartons are also used by our customers to attract consumer attention at the point-of-sale. We manufacture express mail packages for the overnight courier industry, provide inserts and labels, as well as rigid packaging and other printed packaging products, such as transaction cards (e.g., credit, debit, etc.), brochures, product literature, marketing materials (such as booklets, folders, inserts, cover sheets and slipcases)\nand grower tags and plant stakes for the horticultural market. For the global healthcare market, we manufacture paperboard packaging for over-the-counter and prescription drugs. Our customers generally use our inserts and labels to provide customer product information either inside a secondary package (e.g., a folding carton) or affixed to the outside of a primary package (e.g., a bottle). Folding cartons typically protect customers products during shipment and distribution, and employ graphics to promote them at retail. We manufacture folding cartons from recycled and virgin paperboard, laminated paperboard and various substrates with specialty characteristics, such as grease masking and microwaveability. We print, coat, die-cut and glue the cartons to customer specifications and ship finished cartons to customers for assembling, filling and sealing. We employ a broad range of offset, flexographic, gravure, backside printing, coating and finishing technologies, as well as iridescent, holographic, textured and dimensional effects to provide differentiated packaging products, and support our customers with new package development, innovation and design services and package testing services. Prior to divesting our interior partitions operations in September 2023, we manufactured and sold our solid fiber and corrugated partitions and die-cut paperboard components principally to glass container manufacturers, producers of beer, food, wine, spirits, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, and the automotive industry.\nSales of consumer packaging products to external customers accounted for 24.2%, 23.2% and 23.5% of our net sales in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 8. Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for additional information.\nGlobal Paper Segment\nOur Global Paper segment consists of our commercial paper operations and generates its revenues primarily from the sale of containerboard, paperboard and specialty grades to external customers, and we serve primarily corrugated packaging, folding carton, food service, liquid packaging, tobacco and commercial print markets. We sell our products globally to customers who value our scale, wide range of products, and service. Sales of global paper products to external customers accounted for 21.5%, 27.9% and 26.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 8. Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for additional information.\nDistribution Segment\nOur Distribution segment consists of our distribution and display assembly operations and generates its revenues primarily from the distribution of packaging products and assembly of display products. We distribute corrugated packaging materials and other specialty packaging products, including stretch film, void fill, carton sealing tape and other specialty tapes, through our network of warehouses and distribution facilities. We also provide contract packing services, such as multi-product promotional packing and product manipulation, such as multipacks and onpacks. Sales in our Distribution segment to external customers accounted for 6.2%, 6.6% and 6.7% of our net sales in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 8. Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for additional information.\nSeasonality\nWhile our businesses are not materially impacted by seasonality, there is some variability in demand that occurs from quarter to quarter, with net sales in the first quarter of each fiscal year typically being the lowest. As such, we disclose net sales, Adjusted EBITDA (as hereinafter defined) and shipment data by segment by quarter in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Generally, we expect more of our earnings and cash flows to be generated in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half of the fiscal year due to these variations and other factors, including the timing of scheduled mill maintenance outages.\nRaw Materials\nThe primary raw materials used by our mill operations are recycled fiber at our recycled containerboard and paperboard mills and virgin fiber from hardwoods and softwoods at our virgin containerboard and paperboard mills. Certain of our virgin containerboard is manufactured with some recycled fiber content. Our overall fiber sourcing for\nall of our mills is approximately 60% virgin and 40% recycled. See Item 2. Properties for additional information. Recycled fiber prices and virgin fiber prices can fluctuate significantly. Recycled fiber costs were lower in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, while virgin fiber costs were relatively flat in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.\nContainerboard and paperboard are the primary raw materials used by our converting operations. Our converting operations use many different grades of containerboard and paperboard. We supply substantially all of our converting operations' needs for containerboard and paperboard from our own mills and through the use of trade swaps with other manufacturers. These arrangements allow us to optimize our mill system and reduce freight costs. Because there are other suppliers that produce the necessary grades of containerboard and paperboard used in our converting operations, we believe we would be able to source significant replacement quantities from other suppliers in the event that we incur production disruptions for recycled or virgin containerboard and paperboard.\nEnergy\nEnergy is one of the most significant costs of our mill operations. The cost of natural gas, coal, oil, electricity and purchased biomass fuel at times has fluctuated significantly. In our recycled paperboard mills, we use primarily natural gas and electricity, supplemented at certain mills with fuel oil, to generate steam used in the paper making process. In our virgin fiber mills, we use biomass, natural gas, fuel oil and coal to generate steam used in the pulping and paper making processes and to generate some or all the electricity used on site. We primarily use purchased electricity and natural gas to operate our converting facilities. We generally purchase these products from suppliers at market or tariff rates. Our energy costs decreased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. From time to time, we use commodity contracts to hedge energy exposures. See Item 1. Business - Governmental Regulation - Environmental and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Energy and Derivative Instruments / Forward Contracts for additional information.\nTransportation\nInbound and outbound freight is a significant cost for us. Factors that influence our freight expense are distance between shipping and delivery locations, distance from our facilities to customers and suppliers, mode of transportation (rail, truck, intermodal and ocean) and freight rates, which are influenced by supply and demand and fuel costs. Freight costs continued to increase in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The principal markets for our products are in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia.\nSales and Marketing\nNone of our external customers individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2023. We generally manufacture our products pursuant to our customers orders. We believe that we have good relationships with our customers.\nAs a result of our vertical integration, our mill utilization may be directly impacted by changes in demand for our packaging products. During fiscal 2023, approximately two-thirds of our coated natural kraft tons shipped, approximately three-fifths of our coated recycled paperboard tons shipped and approximately one-fifth of our bleached paperboard tons shipped were delivered to our converting operations, primarily to manufacture folding cartons, and approximately four-fifths of our containerboard tons shipped, including trade swaps and buy/sell transactions, were delivered to our converting operations to manufacture corrugated products. We have the ability to move our internal sourcing among certain of our mills to optimize the efficiency of our operations. We believe that our ability to leverage our full portfolio of differentiated solutions and capabilities enables us to set ourselves apart from our competitors.\nWe market our products primarily through our own sales force. We also market a number of our products through independent sales representatives and independent distributors. We generally pay our sales personnel a combination of base salary, commissions and annual bonus. We pay our independent sales representatives on a commission basis. Orders from our customers generally do not have significant lead times. We discuss net sales to unaffiliated customers through our foreign operations and other financial information in Note 8. Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCompetition\nWe operate in a competitive global marketplace. The industries in which we operate are highly competitive, and no single company dominates any of those industries. Our containerboard and paperboard operations compete with integrated and non-integrated national and regional companies operating primarily in North America, and to a limited extent, manufacturers outside of North America. Our competitors include large and small, vertically integrated companies and numerous smaller non-integrated companies. In the corrugated packaging and folding carton markets, we compete with a significant number of national, regional and local packaging suppliers in North America and abroad. In the promotional point-of-purchase display and converted paperboard products markets, we primarily compete with a smaller number of national, regional and local companies offering highly specialized products.\nSince all of our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments, we regularly discuss sales opportunities for new business or for renewal of existing business with customers. Our packaging products compete with packaging made from other materials, including plastics. The primary competitive factors we face include price, design, product innovation, quality, service and sustainability, with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line and customer preferences. Our machinery solutions represent one example of how we compete by providing differentiated solutions that create value for our customers. We believe that we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors and we obtain feedback on our performance with periodic customer surveys, among other means.\nThe industries in which we operate have undergone consolidation. Within the packaging products industry, larger customers, with an expanded geographic presence, have tended to seek suppliers that can, because of their broad geographic presence, efficiently and economically supply all or a range of their packaging needs. In addition, our customers continue to demand higher quality products meeting increasingly strict quality control requirements. Increasing demand for more sustainable products is also impacting our industry. See Item 1. Business - Sustainability for additional information.\nGovernmental Regulation\nHealth and Safety\nOur business involves the use of heavy equipment, machinery and chemicals and requires the performance of activities that create safety exposures. Safeguarding the health, safety and overall welfare of our team is a top concern and critical to attracting and retaining the best talent, while also playing a pivotal role in realizing our business and sustainability objectives. We implement our health and safety requirements through a comprehensive, company-wide Safety Excellence System that includes global policies, performance standards, implementation tools, guidance documents, standardized forms, best practice sharing and operational learning. We seek to reduce exposures and eliminate life changing events through engagement, execution of targeted, results-driven activities, and implementation of systems that promote continuous improvement.\nWe are subject to a broad range of foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety, and our safety program includes measures required for compliance. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, operating costs and capital expenditures to meet our health and safety compliance requirements, as well as to continually improve our safety systems. We believe that future compliance with occupational health and safety laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nCertain governmental authorities in locations where we do business have established asbestos standards for the workplace. Although we do not use asbestos in manufacturing our products, asbestos containing material (ACM) is present in some of the facilities we own or lease. For those facilities where ACM is present and ACM is subject to regulation, we have established procedures for properly managing it.\nEnvironmental\nEnvironmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business. Our manufacturing processes involve the use of natural resources, such as virgin wood fiber and fresh water, discharges to water, air emissions and waste handling and disposal activities. These processes are subject to numerous federal, state, local\nand international environmental laws and regulations, as well as the requirements of environmental permits and similar authorizations issued by various governmental authorities.\nWe estimate that we will invest approximately $103 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2024 in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance. It is possible that our capital expenditure assumptions and project completion dates may change, and our projections are subject to change due to factors such as the finalization of ongoing engineering projects and changes in environmental laws and regulations.\nSee Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies - Environmental of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nSustainability\nAt WestRock, our sustainability program is represented by three pillars:\n\u25aaSupporting People and Communities\n\u25aaBettering the Planet\n\u25aaInnovating for Our Customers and Their Customers\nWe have a long history of recycling and are one of the largest recyclers in the paper industry. Our recycling operations collect recovered fiber that is used by our own paper mills and by others to produce new paper products.\nThe virgin wood fiber used in our manufacturing operation is sourced from responsibly managed forests. Our North American virgin fiber sourcing regions are certified to the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI\u00ae) 2022 Fiber Sourcing standard. Our forestland in Brazil is certified to the Brazilian Forest Certification Programme (CERFLOR\u00ae), the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC\u00ae) and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC\u00ae). To provide traceability for the virgin fiber used in our operations, nearly 100% of our wholly owned fiber-based manufacturing facilities have been chain-of-custody certified to internationally recognized standards such as SFI\u00ae, PEFC\u00ae and FSC\u00ae.\nClimate Change\t\t\t\t\t\nSustainability and innovation are fundamental to our business, and we are working to improve the carbon footprint of our manufacturing operations by setting targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and developing projects to become more energy efficient. Our integrated kraft paper mills, our most energy-intensive manufacturing facilities, currently burn renewable biomass to generate approximately 70% of their energy needs. Most of these facilities also self-generate the steam and electricity needed for their manufacturing processes using efficient combined heat and power or cogeneration systems. During fiscal 2023, our recycling operations helped to divert approximately six million tons of paper and packaging that might otherwise go into landfills where it might degrade and release GHGs. Our fiber procurement activities create economic incentives for landowners and family tree farmers to maintain their holdings as working forests that sequester carbon and provide many other environmental benefits, including protection for fresh water supplies and habitats for diverse species of plants and animals.\nGovernance\nBoard-level oversight of climate and other sustainability matters resides with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the board of directors, and six members of the board of directors have sustainability experience.\nIn addition to board-level oversight, we have robust management-level oversight of sustainability matters. WestRocks executive leadership team is responsible for establishing our sustainability strategy, including with respect to climate-related issues. Our Senior Vice President of Strategy and Sustainability, who reports to our President, Global Paper, is responsible for providing guidance on our sustainability approach, helping to link our sustainability and business initiatives and driving implementation of our sustainability strategy throughout the organization in collaboration with other executives. Our Vice President, Sustainability, manages day-to-day implementation of this strategy. In addition to our sustainability executives, we have established cross-functional groups within the organization to facilitate ongoing refinement and execution of our sustainability strategy, develop\nplans to achieve our sustainability targets and embed our sustainability targets into our operations. These groups include representatives from our product stewardship, environmental, innovation, engineering, manufacturing, finance, legal and communications groups.\nTargets and Metrics\nIn 2022, we validated science-based targets (\"SBT\") for GHG emissions reduction aligned to a well below 2-degree Celsius ambition. Our SBT involves reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 27.5% by 2030 from a 2019 baseline year. The SBT also includes a reduction in absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services, fuel and energy activities, upstream and downstream transportation and distribution, and end-of-life treatment of sold products by 27.5% within the same timeframe.\nStrategy\nWe expect our SBT to guide our work as we plan, invest in, organize, and develop projects to reduce our GHG emissions. Our strategy for achieving our SBT is multi-faceted and includes consideration of several alternatives that can be deployed in combination, including energy efficiency projects, fuel switching, low carbon technology investments, electricity grid decarbonization, physical and renewable power purchase agreements and manufacturing footprint rationalizations. Based on our actions to date, the amount we expect to invest to achieve our SBT is not material. We have processes for regularly evaluating and optimizing our SBT strategy to account for changes in markets dynamics and customer preferences, our business operations, laws and regulations and climate science.\nWe have also embedded carbon considerations into our capital planning processes. Our capital project approval form includes a tool that provides project developers, reviewers, and approvers with information on whether their proposed investment will add to or reduce GHG emissions from the affected facility. The tool also can be used to assess potential project impacts on water intake and solid waste generation. This process is designed to increase awareness of GHG emissions and other environmental impacts within the organization and to provide us with information to use in optimizing our SBT and sustainability strategies.\nOpportunities and Risks\nClimate change presents certain opportunities and risks for our business.\nOur climate-related opportunities include:\nIncreasing our sales of fiber-based packaging by capitalizing on shifting consumer preferences for products that advance the circular economy and reduce or replace single-use, fossil fuel-based plastics.\nExpanding our installed base of packaging machinery solutions, which have the potential to improve customers GHG profiles by optimizing raw material usage, improving manufacturing efficiencies and reducing or eliminating plastic waste.\nAttracting investors and talented employees, as well as cultivating positive relationships with communities where we operate and with other stakeholders, by demonstrating our leadership in sustainability with our sustainability targets, including our SBT.\nImproving the resiliency of our energy supply chain and potentially lowering our operating costs by reducing or eliminating fossil fuels such as coal and oil.\nOur climate-related risks include:\nLost production and damage to our physical assets and infrastructure, including our manufacturing facilities, as a result of severe weather-related events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, other extreme storms, wildfires and floods.\nSupply chain disruptions and increased material costs, such as through impacts to virgin fiber supplies and prices, during prolonged periods of heavy rain, heat, drought, tree disease or insect epidemics or other environmental events that may be caused by variations in conditions.\nAdditional compliance costs and burdens resulting from the enactment of new laws and regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions, which could take the form of cap-and-trade, carbon taxes or a GHG reduction mandate.\nHigher prices for certain raw materials and fuels, including natural gas, related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy or the enactment of GHG reduction mandates. Also, new climate rules and regulations that result in fuel efficiency standards could increase WestRocks transportation costs.\nIncreased capital expenditures and/or operating costs to meet our SBT, which could deviate materially from our initial estimates.\nReputational risk tied to customer or other stakeholder perceptions if we are unable to achieve our SBT fully or on time due to various risks and uncertainties or if customer or other stakeholder expectations increase beyond our current SBT commitment, requiring increased capital expenditures and/or operating costs.\nCertain jurisdictions in which we have manufacturing facilities or other investments have already taken actions to address climate change. In the United States (\"U.S.\"), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued the Clean Air Act permitting regulations applicable to certain facilities that emit GHG. The EPA has also promulgated a rule requiring certain industrial facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to file an annual report of their emissions. While we have U.S. facilities subject to existing GHG permitting and reporting requirements, the impact of these requirements has not been material to date. In addition to these national efforts, some U.S. states in which we have manufacturing operations, including Washington, New York, and Virginia, are taking measures to reduce GHG emissions, such as requiring GHG emissions reporting or developing regional cap-and-trade programs.\nSeveral of our international facilities are in countries that have already adopted GHG emissions trading or other regulatory programs. Other countries in which we conduct business, including China, European Union member states and India, have set GHG reduction targets in accordance with the agreement among over 170 countries that established a framework for reducing global GHG emissions (also known as the Paris Agreement), which became effective in November 2016 and which the United States formally rejoined in February 2021.\nWe have systems in place for tracking the GHG emissions from our energy-intensive facilities, and we monitor developments in climate-related laws, regulations, and policies to assess the potential impact of such developments on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and disclosure obligations. Compliance with climate programs may require future expenditures to meet GHG emission reduction obligations. These obligations may include carbon taxes, the requirement to purchase GHG credits, or the need to acquire carbon offsets. Also, we may be required to make capital and other investments to displace traditional fossil fuels, such as fuel oil and coal, with lower carbon alternatives, such as biomass and natural gas.\nAdditional information regarding our GHG targets and strategy are available in our 2022 Sustainability Report, which we prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative 2021 Universal Standards and relevant Topic Standards Option. The report includes a crosswalk to relevant Sustainability Accounting Standards Board disclosure topics and an index of climate information informed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures framework. The topics discussed above and discussed within our 2022 Sustainability Report may not be considered material for SEC reporting purposes. Our sustainability reports are available on our website at www.westrock.com/sustainability. The information contained in our sustainability reports is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the SEC.\nPatents and Other Intellectual Property\nWe hold a substantial number of foreign and domestic trademarks, trademark applications, trade names,\npatents, patent applications and licenses relating to our business, our products and our production processes. Our patent portfolio consists primarily of utility patents relating to our products and manufacturing operations, including proprietary automated packaging systems. Our company name and logo, and certain of our products and services, are protected by domestic and foreign trademarks. Our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, particularly those relating to our manufacturing operations, are important to our operations as a whole. Our intellectual property has various expiration dates.\nHuman Capital\nOverview\nWestRock aims to recruit, develop, and retain diverse, best-in-class talent. To foster their and our success, we seek to create an environment where people can do their best work - a place where they can be their authentic selves, guided by our values. We strive to maximize the potential of our human capital resources by creating a respectful, rewarding, and inclusive work environment.\nThe capabilities of our workforce have evolved as our business and strategy have evolved. We continuously hire for and develop for the new capabilities we need today and for what we expect in the future. We have invested in our commercial, operations, innovation, digital and systems, and technical training capabilities.\nAt September 30, 2023, we employed approximately 56,100 people, approximately 90% were in sales and operations, including manufacturing, distribution, product and services support; and approximately 10% were in general and administration, including groups such as finance, human resources, information technology, legal and supply chain. Approximately 65% were located in the U.S. and Canada and 35% were located in Europe, South America, Mexico and Asia Pacific. Of the approximately 56,100 employees, approximately 71% were hourly and 29% were salaried. Approximately 54% of our hourly employees in the U.S. and Canada are covered by collective bargaining agreements (CBAs), which typically have four to six-year terms. Approximately 25% of those employees covered under CBAs are operating under local agreements that expire within one year and approximately 11% of those employees are governed under expired local contracts.\nWhile we have experienced isolated work stoppages from time to time, we believe that working relationships with our employees are generally good. From October 2022 to February 2023, we experienced a defensive lockout at our Mahrt mill in Cottonton, AL and have experienced a strike at our corrugated converting facility in Dayton, NJ since June 2023. We effectuated contingency plans at both locations and both facilities continued to operate and produce products for our customers. We recently reached a tentative agreement to resolve the strike at the Dayton facility, subject to approval of the requisite union membership.\nIn December 2019, the United Steelworkers Union (USW) ratified a master agreement that applies to substantially all of our U.S. facilities represented by the USW. The agreement has a four-year term and covers a number of specific items, including wages, medical coverage and certain other benefit programs, substance abuse testing, and safety. Individual facilities will continue to have local agreements for subjects not covered by the master agreement and those agreements will continue to have staggered terms. The master agreement permits us to apply its terms to USW employees who work at facilities we acquire during the term of the agreement. The master agreement covers approximately 51 of our U.S. operating locations and approximately 7,300 of our employees. While the terms of our CBAs vary, we believe the material terms of the agreements are customary for the industry, the type of facility, the classification of the employees and the geographic location covered. Negotiations towards a new master agreement commenced in November 2023, and a tentative agreement has been reached. It remains subject to approval of the requisite union membership.\nCulture\nWestRocks culture is grounded in our values of integrity, respect, accountability and excellence.\nAt the core of our employee listening systems is our bi-annual engagement survey, which is augmented with employee pulse checks after hire and promotion, and exit interviews/surveys. These surveys enable us to gather feedback directly from our workforce to inform our programs and employee needs globally. In 2023, 89% of WestRock team members participated in the engagement survey and 77% of global team members participated in the 2022 pulse survey. The 2023 engagement survey showed a slight increase to 77% in engagement when\ncompared to the 2021 full engagement survey of 75%. The engagement survey and pulse check covered topics such as company strategy and direction, leadership, inclusion, safety, teamwork, manager effectiveness, culture, pay and benefits, and learning and development. WestRock results compared favorably to the manufacturing benchmark across multiple indices: engagement, manager effectiveness, communication, growth & development, well-being and behavior change.\nDiversity, Inclusion, Equity and Belonging\nWe are dedicated to creating a work environment where all team members feel that they belong, are respected and valued, and can do our best work.\nAt September 30, 2023, 24% of our global workforce was comprised of women and 36% of our U.S. based workforce was comprised of people of color. Our board of directors includes four women (representing 33% of directors) and two people of color (representing 17% of directors). We have implemented a multi-year Diversity, Inclusion, Equity and Belonging (diversity and inclusion) action plan that we expect will increase our workforce diversity, advance inclusion, equity and belonging throughout the company, accelerate the development and career movement of diverse talent and ensure diverse succession plans.\nIn fiscal 2023, the annual short-term incentive plan for our CEO, our senior leadership team and their direct reports included an evaluation and measurement of progress in the metrics and programs that directly support diversity and inclusion, such as:\n\u25aaTalent acquisition and retention metrics\n\u25aaLearning and development programs for team members\n\u25aaRepresentation progress within and across career streams\nIn fiscal 2022, we partnered with external experts and developed a learning experience focused on unconscious bias and in fiscal 2023, we delivered tailored workshops for 77% of our U.S. hourly employees, 63% of our global hourly workforce, 82% of our U.S. salaried workforce and 71% of our global salaried workforce. This experience is one example of how we are expanding awareness and building the skill set and mindset to develop a more inclusive environment. In fiscal 2023, we developed a learning experience focused on leading inclusively and delivered training for 75% of our U.S. salaried workforce.\nIn collaboration with organizations, such as the Executive Leadership Council, Calibr, Harvard Program for Women, Pathways and Signature, we provide external development opportunities for our diverse talent. To connect and develop team members within WestRock, we support highly engaged Resource Groups for team members who are early in career, women, racial and ethnic minorities, veterans, who identify as LGBTQIA+ or have differing abilities and their allies.\nHealth and Safety\nWe are committed to supporting our team members health and safety. We have an extensive safety program that is implemented at our sites and includes a focus on eliminating safety exposures and reducing life-changing events (\"LCE\"), recordable incidents and lost workdays. Including the operations from the Mexico Acquisition in both periods, in fiscal 2023, we achieved year-over-year improvements in LCEs and recordable incident rate, while lost workdays increased compared to the prior year. Our safety results continue to trend favorably compared to industry performance. We are continuing our focus on human and organizational performance and are conducting training in the U.S. and internationally, which is focused on continuous safety improvement and the relationships that exist among systems, processes, equipment and people to drive better safety practices.\nTalent Attraction, Retention and Development\nThe attraction, retention and development of team members is critical to our success. We accomplish this, in part, by seeking to develop the capabilities of our team members through our continuous learning, development and performance management programs. These programs include our safety, six sigma, supply chain, leadership, commercial and operational development programs.\nWe invest in our leadership through the Leadership Excellence, Elevate and Essentials programs; and we invest in our commercial teams through quarterly product training, best practice sharing, and development workshops that\nfocus on the commercial capabilities needed today and tomorrow to anticipate and meet our customers changing requirements.\nIn fiscal 2022, we initiated the deployment of common equipment and reliability operations/technical training across our sites with a focus on our newest hires. We continue to invest in technical development curriculum so that we continue to build leading technical, engineering, operational talent. We continue to leverage our online learning library, which has over 8,500 courses and 200 playlists by topic area or experience/skill set.\nWe sponsor early in career rotations and college hire programs that support our functions and local operations. We build partnerships with schools, universities and associations to promote future careers in manufacturing. During fiscal 2023, we continued to invest in people, programs and systems to meet the increased talent demand in a dynamic marketplace. We have expanded our relationships with historically black colleges and universities, the National Association of Manufacturers and other partners and associations. In partnership with the Manufacturing Institute and Skill Bridge, we provide onboarding and transition support for our early in career talent and new military hires.\nTotal Rewards\nOur total rewards programs are designed to offer competitive compensation, comprehensive benefits and other programs to support employees growth, both personally and professionally, and the diverse needs and well-being of our employees worldwide. We believe the structure of our compensation and benefit programs provide the appropriate incentives to attract, retain and motivate our employees. We provide base pay that is competitive and that aligns with employee positions, skill levels, experience and geographic location. In addition to base pay, we seek to reward employees with annual incentive awards, recognition programs, and equity awards for employees at certain job levels.\nEmployee benefits packages may include: 401(k) plan, pension plan, core and supplemental life insurance, financial courses and advisors, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance, family planning and adoption assistance, medical and dental insurance, vision insurance, health savings accounts, health reimbursement and flexible spending accounts, well-being rewards programs, vacation pay, holiday pay, and parental and adoption leave.\nOver the past two years, we enhanced certain of the Companys benefits and practices to support the health and well-being of our employees through the challenges of the pandemic and significant supply chain disruptions caused by winter storms and natural disasters. In the fall of 2022, we announced the opportunity for part time work and benefits effective January 2023 for employees who work 20 hours or greater each week. We believe this added work and schedule flexibility will position us to better meet the needs of employees, customers, and manufacturing sites and leverage new sources of talent.\nInternational Operations\nOur operations outside the U.S. are conducted through subsidiaries located in Canada, Latin America, Asia Pacific, and Europe, Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\"). Sales attributable to non-U.S. operations were 24.4%, 18.3% and 18.3% of our net sales in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, some of which were transacted in U.S. dollars. See Note 8.

Forward-looking statements are based on the Companys current expectations, beliefs, plans or forecasts and use words such as may, will, could, should, would, anticipate, intend, estimate, project, plan, believe, expect, target, \"prospects\", potential, \"commit\" and \"forecast\", or words of similar import or meaning or refer to future time periods. Forward-looking statements involve estimates, expectations, projections, goals, targets, forecasts, assumptions, risks and uncertainties. A forward-looking statement is not a guarantee of future performance, and actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statement.\nForward-looking statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, such as developments related to pricing cycles and volumes; economic, competitive and market conditions generally, including macroeconomic uncertainty, customer inventory rebalancing, the impact of inflation and increases in energy, raw materials, shipping, labor and capital equipment costs; reduced supply of raw materials, energy and transportation, including from supply chain disruptions and labor shortages; intense competition; results and impacts of acquisitions, including operational and financial effects from the Mexico Acquisition and divestitures; business disruptions, including the occurrence of severe weather or a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems, such as labor difficulties, equipment failure or unscheduled maintenance and repair; or public health crises; failure to respond to changing customer preferences and to protect our intellectual property; the amount and timing of capital expenditures, including installation costs, project development and implementation costs, and costs related to resolving disputes with third parties with which we work to manage and implement capital projects; risks related to international sales and operations; the production of faulty or contaminated products; the loss of certain customers; adverse legal, reputational, operational and financial effects resulting from information security incidents and the effectiveness of business continuity plans during a ransomware or other cyber incident; work stoppages and other labor relations difficulties; inability to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel, including as a result of the proposed Transaction; risks associated with sustainability and climate change, including our ability to achieve sustainability targets and commitments and realize climate-related opportunities on announced timelines or at all; our inability to successfully identify and make performance improvements and deliver cost savings and risks associated with completing strategic projects on anticipated timelines and realizing anticipated financial or operational improvements on announced timelines or at all, including with respect to our business systems transformation; risks related to the proposed Transaction, including our ability to complete the Transaction on the anticipated timeline, or at all, restrictions imposed on our business under the Transaction Agreement, disruptions to our business while the proposed Transaction is pending, the impact of managements time and attention being focused on consummation of the proposed Transaction, costs associated with the proposed Transaction, and integration difficulties; risks related to our indebtedness, including increases in interest rates; the scope, costs, timing and impact of any restructuring of our operations and corporate and tax structure; the scope, timing and outcome of any litigation, claims or other proceedings or dispute resolutions and the impact of any such litigation (including with respect to the Brazil tax liability matter); and additional impairment charges. Such risks and other factors that may impact forward-looking statements are discussed in Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to certain risks and events that have adversely affected and/or may in the future adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock. In evaluating our business and any investment in our securities, you should consider the following risk factors and the other information presented in this report, as well as the other reports and registration statements we file from time to time with the SEC. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could also adversely impact our business.\nMarket and Industry Risks\nWe Have Been, And May In the Future Be, Adversely Affected by Factors That Are Beyond Our Control, Such as U.S. and Worldwide Economic and Financial Market Conditions, and Geopolitical Conflicts and Other Social and Political Unrest or Change\nOur businesses have been, and may be, adversely affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\nmacroeconomic and business conditions, including deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and related supply and demand dynamics, as well as inflation and deflation;\ngeopolitical conflicts and other social and political unrest or change, and other changes impacting matters such as tax policy, sustainability, environmental regulations and trade policies and agreements;\nconditions in the financial services markets, including counterparty risk, insurance carrier risk, rising interest rates, rising commodity prices, fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the U.S. dollar and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, which may impact price and demand for our products;\nfinancial uncertainties in our major international markets; and\ngovernment deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which we operate.\nWe are continuing to experience lower demand for certain products due to factors such as, but not limited to, challenging macroeconomic conditions, certain customer inventory rebalancing and shifting consumer spending, which has resulted in, among other things, elevated levels of economic downtime, lower production and lower profitability. These conditions have in the past contributed to, and may in the future contribute to, impairment charges. The impact may be further exacerbated if these conditions lead to higher unemployment rates, lower family income, unfavorable currency exchange rates, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment, lower consumer spending or confidence and/or continued shifts in consumer spending. The global economy also continues to experience elevated levels of inflation, and we experienced cost inflation across our business in fiscal 2023, albeit at moderating levels since fiscal 2022. Persistent inflation results in higher manufacturing and transportation costs, which we may not be able to recover through higher prices charged to our customers, particularly given the present dislocation between price and inflation.\nIn addition, changes in trade policy, including renegotiating or potentially terminating, existing bilateral or multilateral agreements, as well as the imposition of tariffs, could impact demand for our products and the costs associated with certain of our capital investments. Macroeconomic challenges may also lead to changes in tax laws or tax rates that may have a material impact on our future cash taxes, effective tax rate or deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nOur results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock could be further adversely affected, perhaps materially, by any of these matters.\nWe Are Subject to Pricing Cycles, Which May Continue to Materially Adversely Affect Our Businesses\nWe have experienced, and are likely to continue experiencing, pricing cycles relating to industry capacity and macroeconomic conditions. The length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product. Prices for our products are driven by many factors, including macroeconomic conditions, demand for our products and competitive conditions in the industries in which we serve, and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes, which may be unpredictable and volatile. Where supply exceeds demand, prices for our products could decline, and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected. We believe that the trading price of our Common Stock has been adversely affected in part due to the impact of macroeconomic conditions on pricing and demand and announcements by certain of our competitors of planned additional capacity in the North American containerboard market, as well as the subsequent implementation of certain of those plans and the impact it will have on future supply and demand dynamics and pricing.\nMany of our customer contracts include price adjustment provisions based upon published indices (including those published by Pulp and Paper Week (PPW)) for our products that contribute to the setting of selling prices for some of our products. PPW is a limited survey that may not accurately reflect changes in market conditions for our products. Changes in how these indices are determined or maintained, or other indices are established or maintained, could adversely impact the selling prices for these products. Published containerboard and paperboard prices declined during fiscal 2023, which will result in lower prices, and likely lower profitability, for certain of our products.\nOur Earnings Are Highly Dependent on Volumes\nBecause our operations generally have high fixed operating costs, our earnings are highly dependent on volumes, which tend to fluctuate due to macroeconomic conditions, supply and demand dynamics in the markets we serve, and due to company and customer specific issues. We are presently experiencing lower demand for certain products due to factors such as, but not limited to, challenging macroeconomic conditions, certain customer inventory rebalancing and shifting consumer spending. These fluctuations at times lead to significant variability in our sales, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition, making it difficult to predict our financial results with certainty. This variability in performance due to fluctuations in volumes may also cause the trading price of our Common Stock to be adversely affected.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic (COVID) affected our operational and financial performance to varying degrees. The extent of the impact of future public health crises, including a resurgence of COVID, or related containment measures and government responses, are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including as it relates to demand and volume. Any failure to maintain volumes may materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe May Face Increased Costs For, or Inadequate Availability of, Raw Materials, Energy and Transportation\nWe rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials, energy sources and third-party companies for transportation services.\nThe costs of recycled fiber and virgin fiber, the principal externally sourced raw materials for our paper mills, are subject to pricing variability due to market and industry conditions. Demand for recycled fiber has fluctuated and may increase due to, among other factors, increased consumption of recycled fiber, including through additions of new recycled paper mill capacity, and increasing demand for products packaged in packaging made with paper manufactured from recycled fiber.\nThe market price of virgin fiber varies based on the availability and source of virgin fiber, and the availability of virgin fiber may be impacted by, among other factors, weather conditions and the housing market. In addition, costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing operations fluctuate, which impacts our manufacturing costs. Certain published indices contribute to price setting for some of our raw materials and future changes in how these indices are established or maintained, as well as their performance, could adversely impact the pricing of these raw materials.\nThe cost of natural gas, coal, oil, electricity and purchased biomass fuel, all of which we use in our business, at times has fluctuated significantly. In fiscal 2022, the price of the natural gas consumed in our manufacturing operations increased significantly compared to fiscal 2021 and continued to increase in fiscal 2023 before declining during the last half of fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. When energy costs increase, leading to increases in our operating costs, they could make our products less competitive compared to similar or alternative products offered by competitors.\nWe distribute our products primarily by truck and rail, although we also distribute some of our products by cargo ship. The reduced availability of trucks, rail cars or cargo ships, including as a result of labor shortages in the transportation industry, could adversely impact our ability to distribute our products in a timely or cost-effective manner. We experienced higher freight costs and some distribution delays in the first half of fiscal 2023 and both fiscal 2022 and 2021. While we have generally been able to manage through these issues and have not experienced material disruptions in our ability to serve our customers, they have resulted in significantly higher costs for transportation services. High transportation costs could make our products less competitive compared to similar or alternative products offered by competitors.\nBecause our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments, we may not be able to recoup past or future increases in the cost of raw materials, energy or transportation through price increases for our products, particularly given the present dislocation between price and inflation. The failure to obtain raw materials, energy or transportation services at reasonable market prices (or the failure to pass on price increases to our customers) or a reduction in the availability of raw materials, energy or transportation services due to increased demand, significant changes in climate or weather conditions, or other factors could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe Face Intense Competition\nWe compete in industries that are highly competitive. Our competitors include large and small, vertically integrated companies and numerous smaller non-integrated companies. We generally compete with companies operating in North America, although we have operations spanning North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Factors affecting our ability to compete include the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve, increased competition from overseas producers, our competitors pricing, go-to-market, and sustainability strategies, the introduction by our competitors of new products, technologies and equipment, including the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions, our ability to innovate and to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences and to develop and execute on our go-to-market and sustainability strategies and to maintain the cost-efficiency of our operations, including our facilities. In addition, changes within these industries, including the consolidation of our competitors and customers or changes in capacity, have impacted, and may in the future, impact competitive dynamics. If our competitors are more successful than us with respect to any key competitive factor, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock, could be adversely affected.\nOur products also compete, to some extent, with various other packaging materials, including products made of plastics, wood and various types of metal. Customer shifts away from containerboard and paperboard packaging to packaging made from other materials could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nOperating Risks\nWe May Incur Business Disruptions That Adversely Affect Our Businesses\nWe depend on continuous operation of our facilities. The operations at our facilities have in the past and may in the future be interrupted or impaired by various operating risks, including, but not limited to, risks associated with:\ncatastrophic events, such as fires, floods, earthquakes, explosions, natural disasters, severe weather, including hurricanes, tornadoes and droughts, and pandemics, including COVID, or other health crises or similar occurrences;\ninterruptions in the delivery of raw materials or other manufacturing inputs;\nfailure of third-party service providers and/or business partners to fulfill their commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with agreed upon terms;\ngovernment regulations;\nprolonged power failures;\nunscheduled maintenance outages, including due to equipment breakdowns or failures;\ninformation system disruptions or failures due to any number of causes, including cyber-attacks;\nviolations of our permit requirements or revocation of permits;\nreleases of pollutants and hazardous substances to air, soil, surface water or ground water;\ndisruptions in transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels;\nshortages of equipment or spare parts; and\nlabor disputes and shortages.\nFor example, operations at several of our facilities located in the south and southeastern U.S. have been interrupted in recent years by hurricanes and severe winter weather, resulting in, among other things, lost mill production. In addition, COVID impacted our operations and financial performance to varying degrees, including as a result of supply chain and labor disruptions and higher costs. The extent of the effects of future public health crises, including the impact of a resurgence of COVID, or other business disruptions, on our operational and financial performance in future periods will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Our production capabilities may be disrupted if we are unable to secure sufficient supplies of raw materials or if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively as a result of a business disruption. We have insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles or retentions, policy limits and other conditions, for certain business disruptions; however, we may not be successful with respect to any claim regarding insurance coverage and, if we are successful, any amounts paid pursuant to the insurance may not be sufficient to cover all our costs and expenses.\nBusiness disruptions have impaired, and may in the future impair, our production capabilities and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe May Fail to Anticipate Trends That Would Enable Us to Offer Products That Respond to Changing Customer Preferences or to Protect Intellectual Property Related to Our Products\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to offer differentiated solutions, and we must continually develop and introduce new products and services to keep pace with technological and regulatory developments and changing customer preferences. The services and products that we offer customers may not meet their needs as their business models evolve. Also, our customers may decide to decrease their use of our products, use alternative materials for their product packaging or forego the packaging of certain products entirely. Regulatory developments can also significantly alter the market for our products. For example, a move to electronic distribution of disclaimers and other paperless regimes could adversely impact our healthcare inserts and labels businesses. Similarly, certain states and local governments have adopted laws banning single-use paper bags or charging businesses or customers fees to use paper bags. These and similar developments could adversely impact demand for certain of our products.\nCustomer preferences for products and packaging formats are constantly changing based on, among other factors, cost, convenience, and health and sustainability concerns and perceptions. For example, changing consumer dietary habits and preferences have slowed the sales growth for certain of the food and beverage products that we package. Also, there is an increasing focus among consumers to ensure that products delivered through e-commerce are packaged efficiently. In addition, customers are increasingly interested in the carbon footprint of our products. Our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock, could be adversely affected if we fail to anticipate and address these and other trends, including by developing and offering products that respond to changing customer preferences.\nOur success also depends, in part, upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection for certain proprietary packaging products and packaging machine technologies used to produce our products. Failure to protect our existing intellectual property may result in the loss of valuable legal rights. Our competitors may obtain intellectual property rights that could require us to license those rights or to modify or cease the use or sale of certain of our technologies or products. Our patents could be invalidated, rendered unenforceable, circumvented, challenged or licensed to others, and our pending or future patent applications may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek, if at all. Further, other companies may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate our technologies or design around our patents, and steps we take to protect our technologies may not prevent misappropriation of those technologies.\nOur Capital Expenditures May Not Achieve the Desired Outcomes or May Be Completed at a Higher Cost than Anticipated\nWe operate in a capital-intensive industry, and many of our capital projects are complex, costly and/or implemented over an extended period of time. Our expenditures for capital projects could be higher than we anticipate, we may experience unanticipated business disruptions or delays in completing the projects, and/or we may not achieve the desired benefits from those projects, including as a result of a deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or in our business, unavailability of capital equipment or related materials, delays in obtaining permits or other requisite approvals or changes in laws and regulations. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock. In addition,\ndisputes between us and contractors who are involved with implementing capital projects could lead to time-consuming and costly litigation.\nWe Are Exposed to Risks Related to International Sales and Operations\nWe derived 24.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2023 from outside the U.S. through international operations, some of which were transacted in U.S. dollars. In addition, certain of our domestic operations have sales to foreign customers. Our operating results and business prospects could be adversely affected by risks related to the countries outside the U.S. in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products. Countries are exposed to varying degrees of economic, political and social unrest or instability. In addition, economies and operating environments have been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted to varying degrees by public health crises. We are exposed to risks of operating in various countries, including, but not limited to, risks associated with:\ngeopolitical events and political, economic and social unrest or instability, including downturns or changes in economic activity due to, among other things, regional conflicts or commodity inflation;\nthe difficulties, and costs of complying, with a wide variety of complex and changing laws, treaties and regulations;\nearnings and cash flows that may be subject to tax withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;\nrepatriating cash from foreign countries to the U.S.;\nimport and export restrictions and other trade barriers;\nresponding to disruptions in existing trade agreements or increased trade tensions between countries or political and economic unions;\nmaintaining overseas subsidiaries and managing international operations;\nobtaining regulatory approval for significant transactions;\ngovernment limitations on foreign ownership or takeovers, nationalizations of business or mandated price controls;\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and\ntransfer pricing.\nWe are also subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions and have several ongoing audit examinations covering multiple years with various tax authorities. We base our tax returns on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations in effect; however, governing tax bodies have in the past and may in the future disagree with certain of our tax positions, which could result in a higher tax liability. For instance, we are challenging claims by the Brazil Federal Revenue Department that we underpaid tax, penalties and interest associated with a claim that a subsidiary of MeadWestvaco Corporation (the predecessor of WestRock MWV, LLC) had reduced its tax liability related to the goodwill generated by the 2002 merger of two of its Brazilian subsidiaries. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data - Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies - Brazil Tax Liability for additional information.\nAny one or more of these risks could adversely affect our international operations and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe May Produce Faulty or Contaminated Products Due to Failures in Quality Control Measures and Systems\nOur failure to produce products that meet applicable safety and quality standards could result in adverse effects on consumer health, litigation exposure, loss of market share and adverse reputational and financial impacts, among other potential consequences, and we may incur substantial costs in taking appropriate corrective action (up to and including recalling products from end consumers) and reimbursing customers and/or end consumers for losses that they suffer as a result of these failures. Our failure to meet these standards could lead to regulatory investigations, enforcement actions and/or prosecutions, and result in adverse publicity, which may damage our reputation. Any of these results could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe provide representations in certain of our contracts that our products are produced in accordance with customer specifications. If the product contained in packaging manufactured by us is faulty or contaminated, the manufacturer of the product may allege that the packaging we provided caused the fault or contamination, even if the packaging complies with contractual specifications. If our packaging fails to meet contract specifications, we could face liability from our customers and third parties for bodily injury or other damages. These liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe Are Subject to Information Security and Information Technology Risks, Including Related to Customer, Employee, Vendor or Other Company Data\nWe use information technologies to securely manage operations and various business functions. We rely on various technologies, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information. In addition, we facilitate a variety of business processes and activities, including reporting on our business and interacting with customers, vendors and employees. We also collect and store data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. The current cyber threat environment presents enhanced risk for all companies, including those in our industry. Increasing use of artificial intelligence may increase these risks.\nOur systems, and those of our third-party providers and business partners, are subject to recurring attempts by third parties to access information, manipulate data or disrupt our operations. Despite our security design and controls, and those of our third-party providers and business partners, we have in the past experienced, and may in the future become subject to, unauthorized data disclosures, manipulation or loss, system damage, disruptions or shutdowns. These incidents may be due to any number of causes, including cyber-attacks, data breaches, employee error or malfeasance, such as ransomware and data theft by common hackers, criminal groups or nation-state organizations or social activist organizations (which efforts may increase as a result of geopolitical events and political and social unrest or instability around the world), power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, service provider failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. Moreover, hardware, software or applications that we or third parties use may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. Misuse of internal applications, theft of intellectual property, trade secrets or other corporate assets, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information could result from such incidents.\nIn January 2021, we detected a ransomware attack impacting certain of our systems (the Ransomware Incident). In response, we proactively shut down a number of our systems, which impacted certain of our operations, including our ability to produce and ship paper and packaging. Due to these actions, our mill system production was approximately 115,000 tons lower than planned for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, and we estimated the pre-tax income impact of the lost sales and operational disruption of this incident, as well as ransomware recovery costs, at approximately $80 million. In response to the Ransomware Incident, we accelerated information technology investments that we had previously planned to make in future periods in order to further strengthen our information security and technology infrastructure. As a result, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur, significant costs as we enhance our data security and take further steps to prevent unauthorized access to, or manipulation of, our systems and data. Despite these efforts, similar incidents may occur in the future. In particular, the Ransomware Incident may embolden individuals or groups to target our systems. Additionally, while we have insurance coverage in place to address various information security risks, this insurance coverage is subject to a deductible and may not be sufficient to cover all losses or types of claims that may arise in connection with such incidents.\nThe information security-related vulnerabilities that we face may remain undetected for an extended period of time. We may also face challenges and risks during our integration of acquired businesses and operations as we upgrade and standardize our information technology systems. We maintain contingency plans and processes to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events; however, these events could nonetheless result in disruptions and damage like that we suffered in connection with the Ransomware Incident or the misappropriation of sensitive data, and depending on their nature and scope, could lead to the compromise of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes, operational disruptions and exposure to liability. Such disruptions or misappropriations and the resulting\nrepercussions, including reputational damage and legal claims or proceedings, may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe May Be Adversely Impacted By Work Stoppages and Other Labor Relations Matters\nA significant number of our union employees are governed by CBAs. We are currently negotiating a new master agreement with the USW, as the current agreement, which covers approximately 7,300 of our employees, will expire in December 2023. In addition, expired union contracts are in the process of renegotiation and others expire within one year. We have reached a tentative agreement on the terms of a new master agreement; however, it remains subject to approval of the requisite union membership, and we cannot predict if or when that approval will be obtained. In addition, we may not be able to successfully negotiate other union contracts without work stoppages or labor difficulties or to renegotiate them on favorable terms.\nWe have experienced isolated work stoppages from time to time, including a defensive lockout at our Mahrt mill in Cottonton, AL from October 2022 to February 2023 and a strike at our corrugated converting facility in Dayton, NJ since June 2023, which resulted in increased costs as described in Note 8. Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Although we recently reached a tentative agreement to resolve the strike at the Dayton facility, it is subject to approval of the requisite union membership, and we cannot predict if or when that approval will be obtained. If we experience an extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities as a result of work stoppages or if we are unable to successfully renegotiate the terms of any of these agreements, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock, could be adversely affected. In addition, our businesses rely on vendors, suppliers and other third parties that have union employees. Work stoppages or other labor relations matters affecting these vendors, suppliers and other third parties could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe Operate in a Challenging Market for Talent and May Not Attract, Motivate and Retain Qualified Personnel, Including Key Personnel\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain employees with the skills necessary to understand and adapt to the continuously developing needs of our customers. The increasing demand for qualified personnel makes it more difficult for us to attract, motivate and retain employees with requisite skill sets, particularly employees with specialized technical and trade experience. Changing demographics and labor work force trends also may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as more tenured and experienced workers retire. If we are unable to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel, or if we experience excessive turnover, including among hourly workers, we may experience declining sales, manufacturing delays or other inefficiencies, increased recruiting, training and relocation costs and other difficulties, and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock may be adversely impacted.\nThe market for both hourly workers and professional workers remained challenging in fiscal 2023. The market and labor environment for hourly workers is increasingly competitive and facing higher levels of labor unrest than has historically been experienced. In certain locations where we operate, the demand for labor continues to exceed the supply of labor, resulting in higher costs. Despite our focused efforts to attract, motivate and retain employees, including by offering higher levels of compensation in certain instances, we experienced attrition rates within our workforce in the past two years that exceeded historical levels. We also incurred higher operating costs at certain of our facilities in the form of higher levels of overtime pay due to shift requirements and staffing challenges.\nIn addition, many professional workers desire a fully remote work setting. We offer flexible working arrangements in the majority of instances; however, we may experience higher levels of attrition within our professional workforce if these workers desire more remote work opportunities than we are able to offer. We may also experience higher levels of attrition if employees do not perceive the purpose and impact of their work to be rewarding or their work-life balance to be satisfactory.\nWe also rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively. The loss of these employees, combined with a challenging market for attracting and retaining employees, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock may be adversely impacted. The proposed Transaction may exacerbate each of these challenges.\nWe Face Risks Associated with Sustainability Matters, Including Climate Change\nOur physical assets and infrastructure, including our manufacturing operations, have been and remain subject to risks from volatile and damaging weather patterns. For example, severe weather-related events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, other extreme storms, wildfires, and floods, have resulted in and/or could in future periods result in lost production and/or physical damage to our facilities. Unpredictable weather patterns or extended periods of severe weather also may result in supply chain disruptions and increased material costs. The ability to harvest the virgin fiber used in our manufacturing operations may be limited, and prices for this raw material may fluctuate, during prolonged periods of heavy rain or drought or during tree disease or insect epidemics or other environmental conditions that may be caused by variations in climate conditions. Such events could also impact the premiums we pay for insurance. Other climate-related business risks that we face include risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy, such as increased prices for certain fuels, including natural gas; the introduction of a carbon tax or government mandates to reduce GHG emissions; and more stringent and/or complex environmental and other permitting requirements. To the extent that severe weather or other climate-related risks materialize, and we are unprepared for them, we may incur unexpected costs, which could have a material effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock may be adversely impacted.\nThere has been an increased focus, including from investors, customers, regulators and other stakeholders regarding sustainability matters, including with respect to climate change, circular economy, packaging waste, sustainable supply chain practices, deforestation, biodiversity, land, energy and water use, diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging and other human capital matters. This increased awareness may result in more prescriptive reporting requirements with respect to these topics, an increased expectation that such topics will be voluntarily disclosed by companies such as ours, and increased pressure to make commitments, set targets and take action to meet them.\nWe have established and publicly disclosed targets and other commitments related to certain sustainability matters, including our SBT to reduce Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 2030 from a 2019 baseline year. All of our sustainability targets and commitments are subject to a variety of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control. If we are unable to meet these targets or commitments on our projected timelines or at all, or if they are perceived negatively, including the perception that they are not sufficiently robust or, conversely, are too costly, our reputation as well as our relationships with investors, customers and other stakeholders could be harmed, which could in turn adversely impact our business, results of operations and the trading price of our Common Stock. Meeting certain of these targets may also increase our capital expenditures and operational costs, and those expenditures could deviate, perhaps materially, from initial estimates. In addition, not all of our competitors may seek to establish climate or other sustainability targets and goals, or at a comparable level to ours, which could result in our competitors achieving competitive advantages through lower supply chain, capital or operating costs.\nWe May Not Be Able To Successfully Implement Our Strategic Transformation Initiatives, Including Our New Business Systems Transformation\nWe have undertaken several projects to enhance productivity and performance, increase efficiency, and deliver cost savings throughout our businesses, which may not be achieved on the anticipated timelines or at all. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we launched a multi-year phased business systems transformation project. The investment will replace much of our existing disparate systems and transition them to a standardized enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a cloud-based platform, as well as a suite of other complementing technologies, across our global organization. The new systems are intended to transform areas such as manufacturing, supply chain, procurement, quote to cash, financials and analytics, and position us to better leverage automation and process efficiency and enable productivity enhancements. An implementation of this scale is a major financial undertaking and will require substantial time and attention of management and key employees. We may not be able to successfully implement our ERP system without delays related to resource constraints or challenges with the critical design phases of the implementation, or we may experience unanticipated business disruptions and/or we may not achieve the desired benefits from the project. Project completion dates and projected costs may also change. Additionally, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected if the new ERP is not successfully implemented. Any of these items, along with any failure to effectively manage data governance risks prior to or during ERP implementation, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe May Be Unsuccessful in Integrating Mergers, Acquisitions and Investments, and Completing Divestitures\nWe have completed a number of mergers, acquisitions, investments and divestitures in the past, including our acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in Grupo Gondi and the divestiture of our interior partition operations and our uncoated recycled paperboard mills. Subject to restrictions in, and compliance with, the Transaction Agreement, we may seek to acquire, invest in or sell, or enter into transactions with other companies in the future. However, we may not be able to identify suitable targets or purchasers or successfully complete suitable transactions in the future, and completed transactions may not be successful. These transactions create risks, including, but not limited to, risks associated with:\ndisrupting our ongoing business, including distracting management from our existing businesses;\nintegrating acquired businesses and personnel into our business, including integrating personnel, information technology systems and operations across different cultures and languages, and addressing the operational risks associated with these integration activities as well as the economic, political, regulatory and compliance risks associated with specific countries;\nworking with partners or other ownership structures with shared decision-making authority;\nobtaining and verifying relevant information regarding a business prior to the consummation of the transaction, including the identification and assessment of liabilities, claims or other circumstances that could result in litigation or regulatory risk exposure;\nobtaining required regulatory approvals and/or debt or equity financing on favorable terms;\nretaining key employees, contractual relationships or customers;\nthe potential impairment of assets and goodwill;\nthe additional operating losses and expenses of businesses we acquire or in which we invest;\nincurring indebtedness to finance an acquisition or investment; and\nimplementing controls, procedures and policies at companies we acquire.\nAmong the benefits we expect from mergers, acquisitions and investments are synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities or access to new markets (or a combination thereof), and in the case of divestitures, the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers that place higher strategic value on these businesses and assets than we do. For mergers and acquisitions, our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of realizing them depend on the successful integration of the acquired businesses and operations with our business and operations. These transactions may not be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock. Even if we integrate these businesses and operations successfully, we may not realize the full benefits we expected within the anticipated timeframe, or at all, and the benefits may be offset by unanticipated costs or delays.\nTransaction Risks\nWe Will Be Subject to Business Uncertainties While the Transaction With Smurfit Kappa is Pending, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Business\nOn September 12, 2023, we entered into the Transaction Agreement. See Item 1. Business for additional information. The Transaction Agreement generally requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course, consistent with past practice, pending consummation of the Transaction and restricts us, without Smurfit Kappas consent, from taking certain specified actions until the Transaction is completed. These restrictions may affect our ability to execute our business and goals, and prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities.\nFurther, in connection with the Transaction, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following the Transaction, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract, motivate and retain key personnel while the Transaction is pending. Accordingly, we may be unable to attract, motivate and retain key employees to the same extent that we have been able to in the past.\nThe Transaction could also disrupt our business or business relationships. Parties with which we have business relationships may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships with us. Parties with which we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties.\nThe pursuit of the Transaction will also continue to place a significant burden on management and other internal resources. It may also divert managements time and attention from the day-to-day operation of our business and the execution of our other strategic initiatives.\nIn addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Transaction, and many of these costs are payable regardless of whether or not the Transaction is consummated.\nAny of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nThe Transaction Agreement Limits Our Ability to Pursue Alternatives to the Transaction\nThe Transaction Agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting a competing proposal that might result in greater value to our stockholders than the Transaction, or may result in a potential competing acquirer of the Company proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire us than it might otherwise have proposed to pay. These provisions include, among others, a general prohibition on us from soliciting or, subject to certain exceptions relating to the exercise of fiduciary duties by our board of directors, entering into discussions with any third party regarding any competing proposal or offer for a competing transaction.\nThe Transaction May Not be Completed Within the Intended Timeframe, or at All, and the Failure to Complete the Transaction Would Likely Adversely Affect Our Business, Results of Operations, Financial Condition, and the Trading Price of Our Common Stock\nThe Transaction Agreement contains a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to its completion, including (i) the approval of a Scheme, pursuant to which each issued ordinary share of Smurfit Kappa will be exchanged for one ordinary share of ListCo (as a result of which Smurfit Kappa will become a wholly owned subsidiary of ListCo), by the requisite majority of Smurfit Kappa shareholders at a Court-convened shareholder meeting; (ii) the passage of resolutions regarding the implementation of the Scheme, the cancellation of Smurfit Kappas premium listing on the LSE, the creation of a standard listing for ListCo on the LSE, and the approval of the Transaction by the requisite majorities of Smurfit Kappa shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting; (iii) the sanction of the Scheme by the High Court of Ireland; (iv) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock to adopt the Transaction Agreement; (v) certain regulatory clearances; and (vi) the registration statement for the offer of ListCo shares in the Transaction being declared effective by the SEC, the approval of the ListCo shares for listing on the NYSE and the FCA having acknowledged that the application for admission of the ListCo shares to the standard segment of the Official List of the FCA has been approved and will become effective, and the LSE having acknowledged that such shares will be admitted to trading on the LSEs main market for listed securities, subject only to the issuance of such ListCo shares upon the completion of the Transaction.\nThe closing conditions to the Transaction may not be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), and, even if all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), the terms, conditions and timing of the required regulatory clearances cannot be predicted, and the Transaction may not be completed in a timely manner or at all. Many of the conditions to completion of the Transaction are not within our control, and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, as applicable). The waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, has expired. Other required regulatory conditions remain outstanding.\nIf the Transaction is not completed within the intended timeframe or at all, we may be subject to a number of material risks. In such instances, the trading price of our Common Stock would likely decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Transaction will be completed. We may also experience negative reactions from our investors, customers, partners, suppliers, and employees.\nUpon termination of the Transaction Agreement under specified circumstances, including, among others, if our board of directors changes or withdraws its recommendation of the Transaction to our stockholders or willfully\nbreaches its non-solicitation covenant, we would be required to make a payment to Smurfit Kappa of $147 million. If the Transaction Agreement is terminated because our stockholders fail to approve the Transaction, we would be required to make a payment to Smurfit Kappa of $57 million.\nStockholder Litigation Could Prevent or Delay the Closing of the Transaction or Otherwise Negatively Impact Our Business, Operating Results and Financial Condition.\nWe may incur additional costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation relating to the Transaction. Such litigation may adversely affect our ability to complete the Transaction. We could incur significant costs in connection with any such litigation, including costs associated with our indemnification obligations to our directors.\nFinancial Risks\nWe May Be Adversely Affected by the Loss of Certain Large Customers\nWe have large customers, none of which individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2023. The loss of large customers could adversely affect our sales and, depending on the magnitude of the loss, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock. In particular, because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments, we regularly bid for new business or for the renewal of existing business. The loss of business from our larger customers, or the renewal of business on less favorable terms, may adversely impact our financial results. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe Have Had Significant Levels of Indebtedness in the Past and May Incur Significant Levels of Indebtedness in the Future, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Impair Our Ability to Operate Our Business\nAt September 30, 2023, we had $8.6 billion of debt outstanding compared to $7.8 billion at September 30, 2022, which primarily reflects additional debt incurred in connection with the Mexico Acquisition, net of debt repayments. The level of our indebtedness has important consequences, including:\na portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to payments on indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities, including acquisitions;\nwe may be limited in our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future business opportunities, acquisitions, general corporate and other purposes;\nour exposure to rising interest rates subjects us to increased debt service obligations, both with respect to existing floating rate indebtedness and the incurrence of additional fixed or floating indebtedness during periods where such rates are in effect, particularly in light of the continued increase in interest rates in fiscal 2023; and\nwe may be limited in our ability to adjust to changing market conditions, which would place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt.\nOur credit facilities contain certain restrictive covenants, including a covenant to satisfy a debt to capitalization ratio. These restrictions may limit our flexibility to respond to changing market conditions and competitive pressures.\nCredit Rating Downgrades Could Increase Our Borrowing Costs or Otherwise Adversely Affect Us\nSome of our outstanding indebtedness has received credit ratings from rating agencies. Our credit ratings could change based on, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. Credit ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and may be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency or placed on a watch list for a possible downgrade or assigned a negative outlook. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook, could increase our borrowing costs, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock. If a downgrade were to occur or a negative outlook were to be assigned, it could impact our ability\nto access the capital markets to raise debt and/or increase the associated costs. In addition, while our credit ratings are important to us, we may take actions and otherwise operate our business in a manner that adversely affects our credit ratings.\nWe sell short-term receivables from certain customer trade accounts on a revolving basis. Any downgrade of the credit rating or deterioration of the financial condition of these customers may make it more costly or difficult for us to engage in these activities, which could adversely affect our cash flows and liquidity.\nWe Have a Significant Amount of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Have Experienced Impairments in the Past, and Any Additional Future Write-Downs Could Materially Adversely Impact Our Operating Results and Stockholders Equity\nAt September 30, 2023, the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets was $6.8 billion. We review the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently when impairment indicators exist. Similarly, we review our other intangible assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment analysis requires us to analyze a number of factors and make estimates that require significant judgment. In fiscal 2020, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1.3 billion in our legacy Consumer Packaging reporting unit. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we determined that our Global Paper and Corrugated Packaging reporting units had carrying values that exceeded their fair values, and we recorded an aggregate pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $1.9 billion. These impairments materially adversely affected our operating results for the applicable reporting periods. The factors that led to these impairment charges may persist, worsen, or recur in the future. Additionally, other future changes, including to underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors, could require us to record additional impairment charges, which could lead to future decreases in assets and reductions in net income. Because the fair values of the Corrugated Packaging and Distribution reporting units are not substantially more than their carrying values, these reporting units have greater risk of future impairments should we experience adverse changes in our assumptions, estimates, or market factors. See Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Goodwill of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Any additional significant write-down could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stockholders equity and could impact the trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe Will Likely Incur Additional Restructuring Costs and May Not Realize Expected Benefits from Restructuring\nWe have restructured portions of our operations from time to time, have current restructuring initiatives taking place, and it is likely that we will engage in future restructuring activities. For instance, during fiscal 2023, we recorded various impairments and other charges associated with our decision to permanently cease operations at our Tacoma, WA and North Charleston, SC containerboard mills and in fiscal 2022, we recorded various impairments and other charges associated with our decision to permanently cease operations at our Panama City, FL mill and to permanently close the corrugated medium manufacturing operations at our St. Paul, MN mill. In addition, we have consolidated, and in the future will likely consolidate, converting operations.\nBecause we are not able to predict or control market conditions, including changes in the supply and demand for our products, the loss of large customers, the selling prices for our products or our manufacturing costs, we may not be able to predict the appropriate time to undertake restructurings. The cash and non-cash costs associated with these activities vary depending on the type of facility impacted, with the costs of a mill closure generally being more significant than that of a converting facility due to the size and complexity of a mill decommissioning process and higher level of investment. Restructuring activities may divert the attention of management, disrupt our operations and fail to achieve the intended cost and operations benefits. In addition, significant judgment is required to estimate restructuring costs, and these estimates, and the assumptions underlying them, may change as additional information becomes available or facts or circumstances related to restructuring initiatives change.\nWe May Incur Withdrawal Liability and/or Increased Funding Requirements in Connection with Multiemployer Pension Plans\nWe participate in several multiemployer pension plans (MEPP or MEPPs) that provide retirement benefits to certain union employees in accordance with various CBAs. Our contributions to any particular MEPP may increase based on the declining funded status of a MEPP and legal requirements, such as those of the Pension\nProtection Act of 2006 (Pension Act), which require substantially underfunded MEPPs to implement a funding improvement plan (FIP) or a rehabilitation plan (RP) to improve their funded status. The funded status of a MEPP may be impacted by, among other items, a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, the inability or failure of companies withdrawing from the plan to pay their withdrawal liability, low interest rates, changes in actuarial assumptions and/or lower than expected returns on pension fund assets.\nWe believe that certain of the MEPPs in which we participate or have participated, including the Pace Industry Union-Management Pension Fund (PIUMPF), have material unfunded vested benefits. We submitted formal notification to withdraw from MEPPs in the past and have recorded withdrawal liabilities, including an estimate of our portion of PIUMPFs accumulated funding deficiency. We may withdraw from other MEPPs in the future. At September 30, 2023, we had recorded $203.2 million of withdrawal liabilities, including liabilities associated with PIUMPFs accumulated funding deficiency demands. In July 2021, PIUMPF filed suit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia claiming the right to recover our pro rata share of the pension funds accumulated funding deficiency, along with interest, liquidated damages and attorneys fees. The impact of increased contributions, future funding obligations or future withdrawal liabilities may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock. See Note 6. Retirement Plans - Multiemployer Plans and Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe Are Subject to a Wide Variety of Laws, Regulations and Other Requirements That May Change and May Impose Substantial Compliance Costs\nWe are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and other requirements, including those relating to the environment, product safety, competition, corruption, occupational health and safety, labor and employment, data privacy, tax and health care. These laws, regulations and other requirements may change or be applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our equipment and/or operations, subject us to enforcement risk, expose us to reputational harm or require us to incur additional costs, including substantial compliance costs, which may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe have also incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our environmental expenditures include those related to compliance with air and water permits and regulatory requirements, waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater, including situations where we have been identified as a potentially responsible or liable party.\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and local anti-bribery laws, including those in Brazil, China, Mexico, India and the United Kingdom, prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of influencing official decisions. Our internal control policies and procedures, or those of our vendors, may not adequately protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed or alleged to have been committed by our employees, agents or vendors. Any such violations could lead to civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties and/or could damage our reputation.\nWe are subject to a number of labor and employment and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that could significantly increase our operating costs and reduce our operational flexibility. Additionally, changing privacy laws in the United States, Europe, Brazil, China and elsewhere have created new individual privacy rights, imposed increased obligations on companies handling personal data and increased potential exposure to fines and penalties.\nFuture compliance with existing and new laws and requirements has the potential to disrupt our business operations and may require significant expenditures, and our existing reserves for specific matters may not be adequate to cover future costs. In particular, our manufacturing operations consume significant amounts of energy, and we may in the future incur additional or increased capital, operating and other expenditures from changes due to new or increased climate-related and other environmental requirements. We could also incur substantial liabilities, including fines or sanctions, enforcement actions, natural resource damages claims, cleanup and closure\ncosts, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury under environmental and other laws. We believe that we can assert claims for indemnification pursuant to existing rights we have under certain purchase and other agreements in connection with certain remediation sites. We have insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles or retentions, policy limits and other conditions, for certain environmental matters; however, we may not be successful with respect to any claim regarding these insurance or indemnification rights and, if we are successful, any amounts paid pursuant to the insurance or indemnification rights may not be sufficient to cover all our costs and expenses.\nOur Bylaws Contain an Exclusive Forum Provision That Could Limit Our Stockholders Ability To Choose Their Preferred Judicial Forum for Disputes With Us Or Our Directors, Officers Or Employees\nFor many years, our bylaws have provided that a state court in Delaware (or, if such a court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us or our directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This provision of the bylaws is not a waiver of, and does not relieve anyone of, duties to comply with, federal securities laws, including those specifying the exclusive jurisdiction of federal courts under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and concurrent jurisdiction of federal and state courts under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nThis provision of the bylaws may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in any action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the action may result in outcomes unfavorable to us, which could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, our business operations, and our financial position or results of operations. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nThere are no unresolved SEC staff comments. Item 2.\tPROPERTIES\nWe operate locations in North America, including the majority of U.S. states, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. We lease our principal offices in Atlanta, GA. We believe that our existing production capacity is adequate to serve existing demand for our products and consider our plants and equipment to be in good condition.\nOur corporate offices, significant regional offices and operating facilities (including our mills) as of September 30, 2023 are summarized below:\nNumber of Facilities\nSegment\nOwned\nLeased\nTotal\nCorrugated Packaging\nConsumer Packaging\nGlobal Paper\nDistribution\n-\nCorporate and significant regional offices\n-\nTotal (1)\n(1)Excludes facilities we are in the process of closing.\nThe tables that follow show our estimated annual production capacity in thousands of tons by mill at September 30, 2023, unless stated otherwise.

Including a partial year adjustment to capacity to reflect footprint actions, where appropriate, our simple average mill system operating rates\nfor the last three fiscal years averaged 88%. We own all of our mills. At September 30, 2023, we also own approximately 136,000 acres of forestlands in Brazil.\nContainerboard Mills - annual production capacity in thousands of tons\nLocation of Mill\nLinerboard\nMedium\nWhite Top\nLinerboard\nKraft\nPaper/Bag\nBleached\nPaperboard\nTotal\nCapacity\nLongview, WA\n1,050\nFernandina Beach, FL\nWest Point, VA\nStevenson, AL\nSolvay, NY\nHodge, LA\nFlorence, SC\nTres Barras, Brazil\nDublin, GA\nSeminole, FL\nHopewell, VA\nRoanoke Rapids, NC\nLa Tuque, Quebec\nMonterrey, MX\nSan Pablo, MX\nCowpens, SC\nMorai, India\nSan Luis Potosi, MX\nTotal Capacity (1)\n5,853\n2,667\n1,095\n10,646\n(1)Reflects the permanent closure of our North Charleston, SC and Tacoma, WA containerboard mills announced in fiscal 2023.

Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Item 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II: FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 5.\tMARKET FOR THE REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nCommon Stock\nOur Common Stock trades on the NYSE under the symbol WRK. As of November 3, 2023, there were approximately 5,465 stockholders of record of our Common Stock. The number of stockholders of record includes one single stockholder, Cede & Co., for all of the shares of our Common Stock held by our stockholders in individual brokerage accounts maintained at banks, brokers and institutions.\nDividends\nIn October 2023, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.3025 per share, representing a $1.21 per share annualized dividend or an increase of 10%. In fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 we paid an annual dividend of $1.10 per share, $1.00 per share and $0.88 per share, respectively. Our capital allocation strategy includes reducing debt and leverage and returning capital to stockholders through a sustainable and growing dividend.\nStock Performance Graph\nThe graph below reflects the cumulative stockholder return (\"TSR\") on an investment of $100 on September 30, 2018, in our Common Stock (assuming the reinvestment of dividends) as of each fiscal year end through September 30, 2023, compared to the return on the same investment in the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Containers & Packaging Index (the Published Index), and the industry peer group that we use for executive compensation purposes.\n(1)Our industry peer group consists of (i) companies in our industry and adjacent/similar industries, (ii) companies with which we compete for talent and/or (iii) companies with a similar revenue scope and scale of our organization.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a multinational provider of sustainable fiber-based paper and packaging solutions. We partner with our customers to provide differentiated, sustainable paper and packaging solutions that help them win in the marketplace. Our team members support customers around the world from our operating and business locations in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia.\nPresentation\nWe report our financial results of operations in four reportable segments: Corrugated Packaging, Consumer Packaging, Global Paper and Distribution. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) is our measure of segment profitability in accordance with ASC 280, because it is the measure used by our chief operating decision maker (CODM\") to make decisions regarding allocation of resources and to assess segment performance.\nCertain items are not allocated to our operating segments and, thus, the information that our CODM uses to make operating decisions and assess performance does not reflect such amounts. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as pre-tax earnings of a reportable segment before depreciation, depletion and amortization, and excludes the following items our CODM does not consider part of our segment performance: multiemployer pension withdrawal (income) expense, restructuring and other costs, net, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, non-allocated expenses, interest expense, net, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, other (expense) income, net, Gain on Sale of RTS and Chattanooga (as hereinafter defined) and other adjustments (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") - each as outlined in Note 8. Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nA detailed discussion of the fiscal 2023 year-over-year changes can be found below and a detailed discussion of fiscal 2022 year-over-year changes can be found in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes as well as the risk factors included in Item 1A.\nStrategic Portfolio Actions\nWe are committed to improving our return on invested capital as well as maximizing the performance of our assets. From time to time, we have completed acquisitions that have expanded our product and geographic scope, allowed us to increase our integration levels and impacted our comparative financials. Subject to restrictions in the Transaction Agreement, we expect to continue to evaluate potential transactions in the future, although their size may vary.\nOn December 1, 2022, we completed the Mexico Acquisition for $969.8 million in cash and the assumption of debt. We accounted for this acquisition as a business combination resulting in its consolidation. The acquiree is a leading integrated producer of fiber-based sustainable packaging solutions that operates four paper mills, nine corrugated packaging plants and six high graphic plants throughout Mexico, producing sustainable packaging for a wide range of end markets in the region. This acquisition is expected to provide us with further geographic and end market diversification as well as position us to continue to grow in the Latin American market. We have included the operations acquired in the Mexico Acquisition in our Corrugated Packaging segment. In conjunction with our Mexico Acquisition, we also moved certain existing consumer converting operations in Latin America into our Corrugated Packaging segment in line with how we are managing the business effective January 1, 2023. We did not recast prior year results related to these operations as they were not material. However, we have disclosed those impacts in the respective results of operations section below. See Note 3. Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn addition, in fiscal 2023, we divested our interior partitions converting operations and sold our Chattanooga, TN uncoated recycled paperboard mill (the resulting gain referred to as the \"Gain on Sale of RTS and Chattanooga\"), sold our ownership interest in an unconsolidated displays joint venture, sold our Seven Hills mill joint venture in Lynchburg, VA, and sold our Eaton, IN, and Aurora, IL uncoated recycled paperboard mills. These divestitures align with our commitment to optimize our portfolio and focus our strategy on key end markets. See\nNote 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Description of Business of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn fiscal 2023, we announced our plan to permanently cease operating our Tacoma, WA and North Charleston, SC containerboard mills and recorded various impairment and other charges associated with the closures. These mills ceased production in September 2023 and June 2023, respectively. In fiscal 2022, we recorded charges associated with our decision to permanently cease operations at our Panama City, FL mill and to permanently close the corrugated medium manufacturing operations at our St. Paul, MN mill. These mills ceased production in June 2022 and October 2022, respectively. By closing these mills, significant capital that would have been required to keep the mills competitive in the future is expected to be deployed to improve key assets. See Note 5. Restructuring and Other Costs, Net of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTransaction Agreement with Smurfit Kappa\nOn September 12, 2023, we entered into Transaction Agreement with Smurfit Kappa. As a result of the proposed Transaction, each share of Common Stock, with certain exceptions, will be converted into the right to receive one ListCo Share and $5.00 in cash. The Transaction is expected to close in the second calendar quarter of 2024, conditional upon regulatory approvals, shareholder approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions. See Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Description of Business of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nBusiness Systems Transformation\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we launched a multi-year phased business systems transformation project that is expected to cost approximately $0.5 to $0.6 billion. The investment will replace much of our existing disparate systems and transition them to a standardized ERP system on a cloud-based platform, as well as a suite of other complementing technologies, across over an estimated 80% of our footprint based on net sales. Approximately 90% of the project spend is expected to be related to the implementation of the ERP, including process definition, standardization and simplification, with the remaining costs primarily related to the implementation of complementing technologies.\nThe new systems are intended to transform areas such as manufacturing, supply chain, procurement, quote to cash, financials and analytics, and position us to better leverage automation and process efficiency and enable productivity enhancements. An implementation of this scale is a major financial undertaking and will require substantial time and attention of management and key employees. Project completion dates and anticipated costs may also change. As the systems are phased in, they will become a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting.\nDue to the nature, scope and magnitude of this investment, management believes these incremental transformation costs are above the normal, recurring level of spend for information technology to support operations. These strategic investments are not expected to recur in the foreseeable future, and are not considered representative of our underlying operating performance. As such, management believes presenting these costs as an adjustment in the non-GAAP results provides additional information to investors about trends in our operations and is useful for period-over-period comparisons. This presentation also allows investors to view our underlying operating results in the same manner as they are viewed by management.\nThe expenses expected to be adjusted from Net income attributable to common stockholders (\"Net Income\") are expensed as incurred during the implementation of software applications and other enabling technologies, and do not include deferred or capitalized costs, depreciation and/or amortization, and costs to support or maintain these software applications or systems once they are in productive use. During the investment period, the normal level of spend associated with non-transformative programs is expected to be maintained and these expenses will not be adjusted in our non-GAAP measures. The items adjusted from Net Income will also be adjusted in our presentation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe expect approximately half of the estimated $0.5 to $0.6 billion investment will represent incremental operating costs to be adjusted in our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share non-GAAP measures over the course of the project, with substantially all such costs being recorded within selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expense in the consolidated statements of operations. These non-GAAP\nadjustments would not include any cash operating costs that are expected to continue to recur after the business systems transformation project is completed.\nIn fiscal 2023, we invested $138 million in our business systems transformation; $91 million of this amount was expensed as incurred within SG&A, including amortization, and $47 million was deferred or capitalized. Of the amount expensed, $79 million, or 87%, were adjusted from Net Income for our non-GAAP measures. The deferred and capitalized costs are being amortized as the project is deployed.\nIn fiscal 2024, we expect the aggregate investment in our business systems transformation to be approximately $220 million. We expect approximately $90 million to be expensed when incurred, of which approximately 80% would be adjusted from Net Income for our non-GAAP financial measures. Approximately $130 million is expected to be deferred or capitalized and amortized over future periods as the project is deployed.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nNet sales of $20.3 billion for fiscal 2023 decreased $946.5 million, or 4.5%, compared to $21.3 billion in fiscal 2022. This decrease was primarily due to lower volumes and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency which were partially offset by increased sales due to the Mexico Acquisition and higher selling price/mix.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders of $1.6 billion in fiscal 2023 was not comparable to the Net income attributable to common stockholders of $944.6 million in fiscal 2022 primarily due to the $1.9 billion pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. See \"Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Goodwill of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition, the decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes excluding the Mexico Acquisition, the impact of increased economic downtime and prior year mill closures, higher restructuring costs, estimated increased cost inflation, increased non-cash pension costs, higher net interest expense, business systems transformation costs and the loss recorded in connection with the Mexico Acquisition. These items were partially offset by the impact of higher selling price/mix, cost savings, the Gain on Sale of RTS and Chattanooga, the contribution from the Mexico Acquisition, and the gain on sale of unconsolidated entities. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $3.0 billion in fiscal 2023 decreased $480.8 million, or 13.9%, compared to fiscal 2022. A detailed review of our performance appears below under Results of Operations.\nEarnings per diluted share was a loss of $6.44 in fiscal 2023 compared to income of $3.61 in fiscal 2022. Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share were $3.02 and $4.76 in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. See the discussion and tables under \"Definitions and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below with respect to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share.\nWe generated $1.8 billion of net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2023, compared to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2022. The $192.5 million decline was primarily due to lower earnings, partially offset by $668.0 million of reduced working capital usage compared to the prior year period. We invested $1,142.1 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2023 while returning $281.3 million in dividends to our stockholders. We believe our strong balance sheet and cash flow provide us the flexibility to continue to invest to sustain and improve our operating performance. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information.\nA detailed review of our performance appears below under Results of Operations.\nExpectations for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2024\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect a decline in net sales and earnings from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, reflecting the normal seasonal sequential volume declines in many of our businesses, continued realization of published price declines and scheduled mill maintenance outages. We plan to continue balancing our supply with our customers demand. We expect sequentially higher recycled fiber costs, lower chemical costs and relatively flat energy, virgin fiber and freight costs. We also expect increased health insurance costs prior to the annual reset of employee deductibles.\nIn fiscal 2024, we expect financial results to be favorably weighted to the back half of the year due to seasonality and the expected improvement in demand trends. We expect continued realization of published price declines, continued balancing of our supply with our customers demand, higher costs driven by higher recycled fiber, freight and wages and other costs, and lower energy, virgin fiber and chemical costs. We also expect our results to be negatively impacted by scheduled mill maintenance outages. We expect approximately 550,000 tons of maintenance downtime compared to approximately 507,000 tons in fiscal 2023. We expect to further progress on cost savings initiatives and are targeting $300 to $400 million in cost savings in fiscal 2024. We expect to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other costs in connection with the proposed Transaction. As noted above, in fiscal 2024, we also expect the aggregate investment in our business systems transformation to be approximately $220 million, approximately $90 million of which we expect to expense as incurred. We expect fiscal 2024 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect our fiscal 2024 cash tax rate will be higher than our expected income tax rate. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flow Activity for additional information.\nRANSOMWARE INCIDENT\nAs previously disclosed, on January 23, 2021, we detected a ransomware incident impacting certain of our systems. Promptly upon our detection of this incident, we initiated response and containment protocols and our security teams, supplemented by leading cyber defense firms, worked to remediate this incident. These actions included taking preventative measures, such as shutting down certain systems out of an abundance of caution, as well as taking steps to supplement existing security monitoring, scanning and protective measures. In our Form 10-Q for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we announced that all systems were back in service.\nIn fiscal 2022 and 2023, we realized incremental progress against our resiliency objectives. We improved our mean-time-to-resolve security incidents, optimized our endpoint detection and response technology deployments across all of our workstation and server population, transitioned all of our local drives to cloud-based storage, and progressed against key goals to modernize the security and infrastructure of our operating locations. In fiscal 2024, we expect to further advance the maturity of our resiliency posture by continuing to execute against our multi-year roadmap. Quarterly progress, as well as key risks and issues, are reported to the Audit Committee for oversight and monitoring.\nIn fiscal 2023, we received $10 million of business interruption insurance recoveries related to the ransomware incident, which we recorded as a reduction of Cost of goods sold and presented in net cash provided by operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Our recoveries related to the ransomware incident are now complete. In fiscal 2022, we recorded a $57.2 million credit for ransomware insurance recoveries, recording $50.6 million of business interruption recoveries as a reduction of Cost of goods sold and $6.6 million of direct cost recoveries as a reduction of SG&A expense excluding intangible amortization. We present ransomware recoveries received as Net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nFor more information on the ransomware incident, see Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Ransomware Incident of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results for the two years ended September 30, 2023 (in millions):\nYear Ended September 30,\nNet sales\n$\n20,310.0\n$\n21,256.5\nCost of goods sold\n16,725.5\n17,237.5\nGross profit\n3,584.5\n4,019.0\nSelling, general and administrative expense excluding\nintangible amortization\n2,014.4\n1,932.6\nSelling, general and administrative intangible amortization\nexpense\n341.5\n350.4\nMultiemployer pension withdrawal (income) expense\n(12.1\n)\n0.2\nRestructuring and other costs, net\n859.2\n383.0\nImpairment of goodwill and mineral rights\n1,893.0\n26.0\nOperating (loss) profit\n(1,511.5\n)\n1,326.8\nInterest expense, net\n(417.9\n)\n(318.8\n)\nGain (loss) on extinguishment of debt\n10.5\n(8.5\n)\nPension and other postretirement non-service (cost) income\n(21.8\n)\n157.4\nOther (expense) income, net\n(6.1\n)\n(11.0\n)\nEquity in income of unconsolidated entities\n3.4\n72.9\nGain on sale of RTS and Chattanooga\n238.8\n-\n(Loss) income before income taxes\n(1,704.6\n)\n1,218.8\nIncome tax benefit (expense)\n60.4\n(269.6\n)\nConsolidated net (loss) income\n(1,644.2\n)\n949.2\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(4.8\n)\n(4.6\n)\nNet (loss) income attributable to common stockholders\n$\n(1,649.0\n)\n$\n944.6\nNet Sales (Unaffiliated Customers)\nNet sales in fiscal 2023 of $20.3 billion decreased $946.5 million, or 4.5%, compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable foreign exchange rates, which were largely offset by increased sales due to the Mexico Acquisition and higher selling price/mix.\nSee Segment Information below for detailed information regarding the change in net sales before intersegment eliminations by segment.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold decreased to $16.7 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to $17.2 billion in fiscal 2022. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 82.4% in fiscal 2023 compared to 81.1% in fiscal 2022. The dollar decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily due to lower volumes and the impact of cost savings which were partially offset by the impact of estimated increased net cost inflation. Net cost inflation consisted primarily of higher wage and benefit costs, chemical costs, freight costs and virgin fiber costs which were partially offset by lower recycled fiber costs and energy costs including hedges.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense Excluding Intangible Amortization\nSG&A expense excluding intangible amortization increased $81.8 million to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2022. SG&A expense excluding intangible amortization as a percentage of net sales increased in fiscal 2023 to 9.9% from 9.1% in fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to $93.2 million related to the Mexico Acquisition and $90.5 million of business systems transformation costs. Travel and entertainment expense also increased by $19.4 million. Excluding these items, compensation and benefit costs were $117.3 million lower, reflecting cost savings and achievement of lower performance goals compared to the prior year period.\nSelling, General and Administrative Intangible Amortization Expense\nSG&A intangible amortization expense was $341.5 million and $350.4 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The expense primarily represents the amortization of customer relationship intangibles acquired in business combinations.\nMultiemployer Pension Withdrawal (Income) Expense\nIn fiscal 2023 we recorded multiemployer pension withdrawal income of $12.1 million related to non-PIUMPF arbitrations. In fiscal 2022, we recorded multiemployer pension withdrawal expense of $0.2 million. See Note 6. Retirement Plans - MEPPs of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nRestructuring and Other Costs, Net\nWe recorded pre-tax restructuring and other costs, net of $859.2 million and $383.0 million for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Of these costs, $604.6 million and $334.1 million for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, were non-cash. The charges in fiscal 2023 were primarily associated with our decision to permanently cease operations at our Tacoma, WA and North Charleston, SC containerboard mills, and the charges in fiscal 2022 were primarily associated with our decision to permanently cease operations at our Panama City, FL mill and the permanent closure of the corrugated medium manufacturing operations at our St. Paul, MN mill. In addition, in both years we incurred charges for other facility closure activities, reduction in workforce actions and charges associated with acquisition, integration or divestiture activities.\nThese amounts are not comparable since the timing and scope of the individual actions associated with a given restructuring, acquisition, integration or divestiture vary. We generally expect the integration of a closed facilitys assets and production with other facilities to enable the receiving facilities to better leverage their fixed costs while eliminating fixed costs from the closed facility. While restructuring costs are not charged to our segments and, therefore, do not reduce each segment's Adjusted EBITDA, we highlight the segment to which the charges relate. See Note 5. Restructuring and Other Costs, Net of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including a description of the type of costs incurred. We have restructured portions of our operations from time to time, have current restructuring initiatives taking place, and it is likely that we will engage in future restructuring activities.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Mineral Rights\nIn fiscal 2023, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment of $1.9 billion, with $1.4 billion and $0.5 billion in the Global Paper and Corrugated Packaging reportable segments, respectively. The impairment is not included in Adjusted EBITDA of our segments. See Note 8. Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn fiscal 2022, we recorded a $26.0 million pre-tax non-cash impairment of certain mineral rights driven by a lack of new leasing or development activity on the related properties for an extended period of time. With the impairment, we had no value assigned to our remaining mineral rights.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net was $417.9 million and $318.8 million for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Interest expense increased $159.5 million and was partially offset by increased interest income of $60.4 million. The net increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher interest rates on debt in the current year period and increased debt associated with the Mexico Acquisition. These increases were partially offset by higher interest income on our cash in fiscal 2023. Additionally, fiscal 2022 included a $36.2 million reduction in interest expense associated with the remeasurement of our multiemployer pension liabilities for the change in interest rates.\nGain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt\nIn fiscal 2023, gain on extinguishment of debt was $10.5 million and in fiscal 2022, loss on extinguishment of debt was $8.5 million. In fiscal 2023, we discharged $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.00% senior notes due September 2024 using cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our commercial paper program.\nThe loss in fiscal 2022 was primarily related to the redemption of $350 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.00% senior notes due March 2023 primarily using borrowings under our Receivables Securitization Facility (as hereinafter defined).\nPension and Other Postretirement Non-Service (Cost) Income\nPension and other postretirement non-service cost in fiscal 2023 was $21.8 million compared to income of $157.4 million in fiscal 2022. The higher costs in fiscal 2023 were primarily due to lower plan assets at September 30, 2022 compared to the prior year, partially offset by an increase in the expected return on plan assets at September 30, 2022 compared to the prior year. These costs were also increased due to higher interest rates during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Customary pension and other postretirement cost (income) are included in our segment results. See Note 6. Retirement Plans of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOther (Expense) Income, net\nOther (expense) income, net was expense of $6.1 million and expense of $11.0 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The lower net expense in fiscal 2023 primarily included a favorable $13.7 million impact of foreign currency, a favorable $12.0 million of other non-operating costs and a favorable $7.3 million on the sale of businesses, each as compared to fiscal 2022. These items were partially offset by $27.9 million of increased expense in connection with the sale of receivables. The favorable other non-operating costs included a $19.7 million gain on foreign currency exchange contract derivatives entered into in anticipation of the Mexico Acquisition, and the favorable sale of businesses included an $11.2 million gain on the sale of our Eaton, IN and Aurora, IL uncoated recycled paperboard mills.\nEquity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities\nEquity in income of unconsolidated entities in fiscal 2023 was income of $3.4 million compared to income of $72.9 million in fiscal 2022. The decline in income in fiscal 2023 was driven by a $46.8 million non-cash, pre-tax loss to recognize the write-off of historical foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, as well as the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid for the Mexico Acquisition and the carrying value of our prior ownership interest. That loss was partially offset by the $19.3 million pre-tax gain on sale of our displays joint venture and a $7.6 million pre-tax gain on sale of our Seven Hills mill joint venture. Additionally, the change year-over-year was impacted by no longer recording equity income after the purchase of our remaining interest in the operations acquired in the Mexico Acquisition and stronger performance by the displays joint venture in the prior year period. See Note 3. Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGain on Sale of RTS and Chattanooga\nIn fiscal 2023, we completed the sale of our interior partitions converting operations and the sale of our Chattanooga, TN uncoated recycled paperboard mill to our joint venture partner and recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $238.8 million, excluding divestiture costs. Divestiture costs are expensed as incurred and recorded within Restructuring and other costs, net. See Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Description of Business of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $60.4 million for fiscal 2023 at an effective tax rate benefit of 3.5%, compared to income tax expense of $269.6 million at an effective tax rate of 22.1% in fiscal 2022. The low tax rate in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to the tax effects related to the goodwill impairment. See Note 7. Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including a table reconciling the statutory federal tax rate to our effective tax rate.\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nCorrugated Packaging Segment\nCorrugated Packaging Shipments\nCorrugated Packaging shipments are expressed as a tons equivalent in thousands of tons, which includes external and intersegment shipments from our corrugated converting operations, principally for the sale of corrugated containers and other corrugated products. Tons sold from period to period may be impacted by customer conversions to lower basis weight products. In addition, we disclose North American Corrugated Packaging shipments in billion square feet (BSF) and millions of square feet (\"MMSF) per shipping day. In the industry, the term North American Corrugated Packaging commonly refers to U.S. and Canadian operations only.

The increase primarily consisted of $1.1 billion of sales from the operations acquired in the Mexico Acquisition, $281.7 million of higher selling price/mix and $111.6 million associated with the converting operations formerly in the Consumer Packaging segment, which were partially offset by $762.4 million of lower volumes excluding the Mexico Acquisition. Volumes were impacted by lower demand for certain of our products, as well as certain inventory rebalancing throughout the supply chain.\nAdjusted EBITDA - Corrugated Packaging Segment\nCorrugated Packaging segment Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2023 increased $213.7 million compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to an estimated $281.9 million margin impact from higher selling price/mix and $162.1 million of cost savings. These items were partially offset by an estimated $220.6 million impact of economic downtime and prior year mill closures, and $145.2 million of lower volumes. Additionally, we had $131.7 million of other net favorable items that consisted primarily of $161.0 million from the operations acquired in the Mexico Acquisition and $14.9 million associated with converting operations formerly in the Consumer Packaging segment that were partially offset by $33.3 million of higher non-cash pension costs and $28.3 million of lower equity in income of unconsolidated entities excluding our former joint venture in Mexico and $22.4 million of lower net ransomware recoveries in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. Estimated net cost deflation ended the year essentially flat at $3.8 million as cost deflation in the last half of the year more than offset cost inflation in the first half of the fiscal year, each as compared to fiscal 2022.\nConsumer Packaging Segment\nConsumer Packaging Shipments\nConsumer Packaging shipments are expressed as a tons equivalent in thousands of tons, which includes external and intersegment shipments from our consumer converting operations, principally for the sale of folding cartons, interior partitions (before divestiture in September 2023) and other consumer products. We have presented the Consumer Packaging shipments in this manner because we believe investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others find this breakout useful when evaluating our operating performance.

In addition, the prior year period included $103.7 million of net sales for converting operations now included in the Corrugated Packaging segment. Volumes were impacted by lower demand for certain of our products, as well as certain inventory rebalancing throughout the supply chain.\nAdjusted EBITDA - Consumer Packaging Segment\nConsumer Packaging segment Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2023 increased $6.5 million compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA in the period increased primarily due to an estimated $413.8 million margin impact from higher selling price/mix and $58.2 million of cost savings which were partially offset by an estimated $184.8 million of increased net cost inflation, $151.7 million of lower volumes and an estimated $44.0 million impact of economic downtime. Additionally, we had $85.0 million of other net unfavorable items that consisted primarily of $45.2 million of higher non-cash pension costs, $18.7 million of Adjusted EBITDA from the prior year period associated with the converting operations now included in the Corrugated Packaging segment and $12.0 million of unfavorable foreign exchange rates.\nGlobal Paper Segment\nGlobal Paper Shipments\nGlobal Paper shipments in thousands of tons include the sale of containerboard, paperboard, market pulp and specialty papers (including kraft papers and saturating kraft) to external customers. The shipment data table excludes gypsum paperboard liner tons produced by our Seven Hills mill joint venture in Lynchburg, VA (prior to its September 2023 sale) since it was not consolidated.

Additionally, net sales are $108.3 million lower than the prior year period as sales to the operations acquired in the Mexico Acquisition are now eliminated. Volumes were impacted by lower demand for certain of our products, as well as certain inventory rebalancing throughout the supply chain.\nAdjusted EBITDA - Global Paper Segment\nGlobal Paper segment Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2023 decreased $591.4 million compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA in the period decreased primarily due to $429.2 million of lower volumes, an estimated $223.6 million impact of economic downtime and prior year mill closures, and an estimated $19.2 million of increased net cost inflation. These items were partially offset by $121.8 million of cost savings and $22.6 million of margin impact from higher selling price/mix. Additionally, we had $63.8 million of other net unfavorable items that consisted primarily of $22.3 million of higher non-cash pension costs, $12.4 million of lower net ransomware recoveries and $9.3 million of lower net weather recoveries in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022.\nDistribution Segment\nDistribution Shipments\nDistribution shipments are expressed as a tons equivalent in thousands of tons, which includes external and intersegment shipments from our distribution and display assembly operations.

The lower volumes were primarily due to lower moving and storage business volumes in fiscal 2023 and large healthcare orders in the prior year period.\nIn April 2023, one of our larger Distribution segment customers notified us that they were transitioning their business to a third party. We do not expect the impact on our consolidated operations to be material, although we expect the segments net sales and Adjusted EBITDA to be reduced until the sales are replaced.\nAdjusted EBITDA - Distribution Segment\nDistribution segment Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2023 decreased $42.7 million compared to the prior year primarily due to $48.9 million of lower volumes and an estimated $23.4 million of increased net cost inflation that were partially offset by $15.5 million of cost savings and an estimated $12.9 million of margin impact from higher selling price/mix.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe have funded our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, mergers, acquisitions and investments, restructuring activities, dividends and stock repurchases from net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from the sale of receivables under our accounts receivable monetization agreements, proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment removed from service and proceeds received in connection with the issuance of debt and equity securities. See Note 14. Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information regarding our debt.\nWe are a party to enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain contractual obligations are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2023,\nwhile others are considered future obligations. Our contractual obligations primarily consist of items such as long-term debt, including current portion, lease obligations, purchase obligations and other obligations. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Contractual Obligations, for additional information.\nCash and cash equivalents were $393.4 million at September 30, 2023 and $260.2 million at September 30, 2022. Approximately half of the cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2023 were held outside of the U.S. The proportion of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. generally varies from period to period. At September 30, 2023, total debt was $8.6 billion, $533.0 million of which was current. At September 30, 2022, total debt was $7.8 billion, $212.2 million of which was current. Included in our total debt at September 30, 2023 was $157.0 million of non-cash acquisition related step-up. During fiscal 2023, debt increased $0.8 billion primarily due to the Mexico Acquisition, net of debt repayments. See Note 3. Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Funding for our domestic operations in the foreseeable future is expected to come from sources of liquidity within our domestic operations, including cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowings under our credit facilities. As such, our foreign cash and cash equivalents are not expected to be a key source of liquidity to our domestic operations.\nAt September 30, 2023, we had approximately $3.4 billion of available liquidity under our long-term committed credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents. Our primary availability is under our revolving credit facilities and Receivables Securitization Facility, the majority of which matures July 2027. This liquidity may be used to provide for ongoing working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and dividends.\nOn September 22, 2023, we discharged $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.00% senior notes due September 2024 using cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our commercial paper program and recorded a $10.5 million gain on extinguishment of debt. On March 22, 2022, we redeemed $350 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.00% senior notes due March 2023 primarily using borrowings under our Receivables Securitization Facility and recorded an $8.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt.\nOur credit facilities contain certain restrictive covenants, including a covenant to satisfy a debt to capitalization ratio. We test and report our compliance with these covenants as required by these facilities and were in compliance with them as of September 30, 2023.\nAt September 30, 2023, we had $77.6 million of outstanding letters of credit not drawn upon.\nWe use a variety of working capital management strategies including supply chain financing (\"SCF\") programs, vendor financing and commercial card programs, monetization facilities where we sell short-term receivables to a group of third-party financial institutions and receivables securitization facilities. We describe these programs below.\nWe engage in certain customer-based SCF programs to accelerate the receipt of payment for outstanding accounts receivables from certain customers. Certain costs of these programs are borne by the customer or us. Receivables transferred under these customer-based SCF programs generally meet the requirements to be accounted for as sales in accordance with guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 860, Transfers and Servicing (ASC 860), resulting in derecognition of such receivables from our consolidated balance sheets. Receivables involved with these customer-based SCF programs constitute approximately 2% of our annual net sales. In addition, we have monetization facilities that sell to third-party financial institutions all of the short-term receivables generated from certain customer trade accounts. See Note 13. Fair Value - Accounts Receivable Monetization Agreements for a discussion of our monetization facilities.\nOur working capital management strategy includes working with our suppliers to revisit terms and conditions, including the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers generally range from payable upon receipt to 120 days and vary for items such as the availability of cash discounts. We do not believe our payment terms will be shortened significantly in the near future, and we do not expect our net cash provided by operating activities to be significantly impacted by additional extensions of payment terms. Certain financial institutions offer voluntary SCF programs that enable our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from us to the financial institutions on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus might be more beneficial to our suppliers. We and our suppliers agree on commercial terms for the goods\nand services we procure, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in SCF programs. The suppliers sell us goods or services and issue the associated invoices to us based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. The due dates of the invoices are not extended due to the suppliers participation in SCF programs. Our suppliers, at their sole discretion if they choose to participate in a SCF program, determine which invoices, if any, they want to sell to the financial institutions. No guarantees are provided by us under SCF programs and we have no economic interest in a suppliers decision to participate in the SCF program. Therefore, amounts due to our suppliers that elect to participate in SCF programs are included in the line items Accounts payable and Other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and the activity is reflected in net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Based on correspondence with the financial institutions that are involved with our two primary SCF programs, while the amount suppliers elect to sell to the financial institutions varies from period to period, the amount generally averages approximately 19% to 21% of our accounts payable balance.\nWe also participate in certain vendor financing and commercial card programs to support our travel and entertainment expenses and smaller vendor purchases. Amounts outstanding under these programs are classified as debt primarily because we receive the benefit of extended payment terms and a rebate from the financial institution that we would not have otherwise received without the financial institution's involvement. We also have the Receivables Securitization Facility that allows for borrowing availability based on underlying accounts receivable eligibility and compliance with certain covenants. See Note 14 Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our Receivables Securitization Facility and the amount outstanding under our vendor financing and commercial card programs.\nCash Flow Activity\nYear Ended September 30,\n(In millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,827.9\n$\n2,020.4\nNet cash used for investing activities\n$\n(1,507.2\n)\n$\n(776.0\n)\nNet cash used for financing activities\n$\n(193.5\n)\n$\n(1,281.3\n)\nNet cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2023 decreased $192.5 million from fiscal 2022 primarily due to lower earnings partially offset by $668.0 million of reduced working capital usage compared to the prior year period. The changes in working capital in fiscal 2023 and 2022 included a use of cash of $32.5 million and a source of cash of $58.8 million, respectively, resulting from the sale of accounts receivables in connection with the Monetization Agreement (as defined in Note 13. Fair Value).\nNet cash used for investing activities of $1,507.2 million in fiscal 2023 consisted primarily of $1,142.1 million for capital expenditures and $853.5 million of cash paid for the purchase of businesses, net of cash acquired which were partially offset by $318.2 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of our interior partitions converting operations and Chattanooga, TN uncoated recycled paperboard mill, $53.4 million of proceeds from the sale of two joint ventures, $42.2 million of proceeds from corporate owned life insurance, $27.6 million of proceeds from the sale of two uncoated recycled paperboard mills, $23.2 million of proceeds from currency forward contracts and $26.8 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Net cash used for investing activities of $776.0 million in fiscal 2022 consisted primarily of $862.6 million for capital expenditures that was partially offset by $60.8 million of proceeds from corporate owned life insurance and $28.2 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, primarily for the sale of a previously closed facility.\nWe invested $1,142.1 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2023, which was in line with the $1.0 to $1.1 billion we expected to invest. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2024. We expect this level of capital investment will allow us to continue to invest in safety, environmental and maintenance projects, while also making investments to support productivity and growth in our business and complete certain asset recapitalization and to initiate strategic investments. However, our capital expenditure assumptions may change, project completion dates may change, or we may decide to invest a different amount depending upon opportunities we identify, or changes in market conditions or to comply with changes in laws and regulations.\nIn fiscal 2023, net cash used for financing activities of $193.5 million consisted primarily of cash dividends paid to stockholders of $281.3 million that was partially offset by a net additions to debt of $101.1 million due to the Mexico Acquisition, net of debt repayments. In fiscal 2022, net cash used for financing activities of $1.3 billion consisted primarily of share repurchases of $600.0 million, a net decrease in debt of $452.7 million and cash dividends paid to stockholders of $259.5 million.\nWe estimate that we will invest approximately $103 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2024 in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance. We were obligated to purchase approximately $353 million of fixed assets at September 30, 2023 for various capital projects.\nAt September 30, 2023, the U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating losses and other U.S. federal and state tax credits available to us aggregated approximately $41 million in future potential reductions of U.S. federal, state and foreign cash taxes. These items are primarily for foreign and state net operating losses and credits that generally will be utilized between fiscal 2024 and 2042. Our cash tax rate is highly dependent on our taxable income, utilization of net operating losses and credits, changes in tax laws or tax rates, capital expenditures and other factors. Barring significant changes in our current assumptions, including changes in tax laws or tax rates, forecasted taxable income, levels of capital expenditures and other items, we expect our fiscal 2024 cash tax rate will be approximately 13 percentage points higher than our expected income tax rate. The higher cash tax rate expected in fiscal 2024 is primarily due to the timing of depreciation on our qualifying capital investments as allowed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, new legislation requiring amortization of research and experimental costs instead of a full deduction in the year incurred and cash taxes due as a result of a deferred payment on the sale of RTS and Chattanooga. We expect our fiscal 2025 and 2026 cash tax rate to be approximately 5 percentage points higher than our income tax rate primarily due to the timing of depreciation on our qualifying capital investments as allowed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and legislation requiring amortization of research and experimental costs instead of a full deduction in the year incurred. These rates are subject to change for a variety of reasons, including as a result of consummation of the proposed Transaction.\nDuring fiscal 2023 and 2022, we made contributions of $28.2 million and $21.2 million, respectively, to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans. Based on current facts and assumptions, we expect to contribute approximately $25 million to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans in fiscal 2024. Based on current assumptions, including future interest rates, we estimate that minimum pension contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans will be approximately $22 million to $23 million annually in fiscal 2025 through 2028. We have made contributions and expect to continue to make contributions in the coming years to our pension plans in order to ensure that our funding levels remain adequate in light of projected liabilities and to meet the requirements of the Pension Act and other regulations. The net overfunded status of our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans at September 30, 2023 was $408.3 million. See Note 6. Retirement Plans of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn the normal course of business, we evaluate our potential exposure to MEPPs, including with respect to potential withdrawal liabilities. In fiscal 2018, we submitted formal notification to withdraw from certain MEPPs, including PIUMPF, and recorded estimated withdrawal liabilities for each. We also have liabilities associated with other MEPPs from which we, or legacy companies, have withdrawn in the past. In fiscal 2024, we expect to pay approximately $11 million in withdrawal liabilities, excluding accumulated funding deficiency demands. With respect to certain other MEPPs, in the event we withdraw from one or more of the MEPPs in the future, it is reasonably possible that we may incur withdrawal liabilities in connection with such withdrawals. Our estimate of any such withdrawal liability, both individually and in the aggregate, is not material for the remaining plans in which we participate. At September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, we had recorded withdrawal liabilities of $203.2 million and $214.7 million, respectively, including liabilities associated with PIUMPFs accumulated funding deficiency demands. The liability reduction in fiscal 2023 was primarily the result of non-PIUMPF arbitrations, the impact of which is reflected in Multiemployer pension withdrawal (income) expense on our consolidated statements of operations. See Note 6. Retirement Plans - Multiemployer Plans of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn October 2023, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.3025 per share, representing a $1.21 per share annualized dividend or an increase of 10%. In fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 we paid an annual dividend of $1.10 per share, $1.00 per share and $0.88 per share, respectively. Our capital allocation strategy includes reducing debt and leverage and returning capital to stockholders through a sustainable and growing dividend.\nIn July 2015, our board of directors authorized a repurchase program of up to 40.0 million shares of our Common Stock, representing approximately 15% of our outstanding Common Stock as of July 1, 2015. On May 4, 2022, our board of directors authorized a new repurchase program of up to 25.0 million shares of our Common Stock, plus any unutilized shares left from the July 2015 authorization. The 25.0 million shares represented an additional authorization of approximately 10% of our outstanding Common Stock. Shares of our Common Stock may be purchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions. In fiscal 2023, we had no share repurchases. In fiscal 2022, we repurchased approximately 12.6 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate cost of $597.5 million. In fiscal 2021, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate cost of $125.1 million. The amount reflected as repurchased in the consolidated statements of cash flows varies due to the timing of share settlement. As of September 30, 2023, we had approximately 29.0 million shares of Common Stock available for repurchase under the program, although we have indefinitely suspended the program in light of the proposed Transaction (and related restrictions imposed by the Transaction Agreement).\nThe Transaction Agreement provides that we will generally continue to conduct our business in the ordinary course and consistent with past practice in all material respects. It also contains covenants that restrict our ability to undertake certain actions without consent from Smurfit Kappa, including incurrence of debt or modification of existing debt arrangements under certain circumstances. Subject to these restrictions, we anticipate funding our capital expenditures, debt service obligations, dividends, pension payments, working capital needs, restructuring activities and other corporate actions for the foreseeable future from cash generated from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from our accounts receivable monetization agreements, proceeds from the issuance of debt securities and other debt financing. In addition, we regularly review our capital structure and conditions in the private and public debt markets in order to optimize our mix of indebtedness. In connection with these reviews, and subject to restrictions imposed in the Transaction Agreement, we may seek to refinance existing indebtedness to extend maturities, reduce borrowing costs or otherwise improve the terms and composition of our indebtedness.\nContractual Obligations\nWe summarize our enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations at September 30, 2023, and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in the following table. Certain amounts in this table are based on managements estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors, including estimated minimum pension plan contributions and estimated benefit payments related to postretirement obligations, supplemental retirement plans and deferred compensation plans. Because these estimates and assumptions are subjective, the enforceable and legally binding obligations we actually pay in future periods may vary from those presented in the table (in millions).\nPayments Due by Period\nTotal\nFiscal 2024\nFiscal 2025\nand 2026\nFiscal 2027\nand 2028\nThereafter\nLong-Term Debt, including current portion,\nexcluding finance lease obligations (1)\n$\n7,987.7\n$\n469.7\n$\n2,531.4\n$\n1,606.9\n$\n3,379.7\nLease obligations (2)\n1,433.3\n320.5\n387.2\n306.2\n419.4\nPurchase obligations and other (3) (4) (5)\n2,532.6\n1,413.3\n334.6\n217.5\n567.2\nTotal\n$\n11,953.6\n$\n2,203.5\n$\n3,253.2\n$\n2,130.6\n$\n4,366.3\n(1)Includes only principal payments owed on our debt assuming that all of our long-term debt will be held to maturity, excluding scheduled payments. We have excluded $123.6 million of fair value of debt step-up, deferred financing costs and unamortized bond discounts from the table to arrive at actual debt obligations. See Note 14. Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the interest rates that apply to our various debt instruments.\n(2)See Note 15. Leases of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n(3)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provision; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.\n(4)We have included future estimated minimum pension plan contributions, MEPP withdrawal payments with definite payout terms and estimated benefit payments related to postretirement obligations, supplemental retirement plans and deferred compensation plans. Our estimates are based on various factors, such as discount rates and expected returns on plan assets. Future contributions are subject to changes in our funded status based on factors such as investment performance, discount rates, returns on plan assets and changes in legislation. It is possible that our assumptions may change, actual market performance may vary or we may decide to contribute different amounts. We have excluded $94.7 million of MEPP withdrawal liabilities recorded as of September 30, 2023, including our estimate of the accumulated funding deficiency, due to lack of definite payout terms for certain of the obligations. See Note 6. Retirement Plans - Multiemployer Plans of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n(5)We have not included the following items in the table:\nAn item labeled other noncurrent liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet because these liabilities do not have a defined pay-out schedule.\n$476.9 million for certain provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes associated with liabilities, primarily for uncertain tax positions due to the uncertainty as to the amount and timing of payment, if any.\n$1,106.9 million of non-recourse liabilities held by special purpose entities (\"SPEs\") that have $1,244.8 million of related restricted assets. See Note 17. Special Purpose Entities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn addition to the enforceable and legally binding obligations presented in the table above, we have other obligations for goods and services and raw materials entered into in the normal course of business. These contracts, however, are subject to change based on our business decisions.\nGuarantor Summarized Financial Information\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWRKCo, Inc. (\"WRKCo\" and the Issuer), a wholly owned subsidiary of WestRock Company (\"Parent\"), has issued the following debt securities pursuant to offerings registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (collectively for purposes of this subsection, the Notes)(in millions, except percentages):\nAggregate Principal Amount\nStated Coupon Rate\nMaturity Date\n$\n3.750\n%\nMarch 2025\n$\n4.650\n%\nMarch 2026\n$\n3.375\n%\nSeptember 2027\n$\n4.000\n%\nMarch 2028\n$\n3.900\n%\nJune 2028\n$\n4.900\n%\nMarch 2029\n$\n4.200\n%\nJune 2032\n$\n3.000\n%\nJune 2033\nUpon issuance, the Notes maturing in 2025, 2027 and March 2028 were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by two other wholly owned subsidiaries of Parent: WestRock RKT, LLC (RKT) and WestRock MWV, LLC (MWV, and together with RKT, the Guarantor Subsidiaries). Parent has also fully and unconditionally guaranteed these Notes. The remaining Notes were issued by the Issuer subsequent to the consummation of the acquisition of KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation in November 2018 and were fully and unconditionally guaranteed at the time of issuance by the Parent and the Guarantor Subsidiaries. Accordingly, each series of the Notes is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by the Parent and the Guarantor Subsidiaries (together, the Guarantors). Collectively, the Issuer and the Guarantors are the Obligor Group.\nEach series of Notes and the related guarantees constitute unsecured unsubordinated obligations of the applicable obligor. Each series of Notes and the related guarantees ranks equally in right of payment with all of the applicable obligors existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt; ranks senior in right of payment to all of the applicable obligors existing and future subordinated debt; is effectively junior to the applicable obligors existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt; and is structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future liabilities of each subsidiary of the applicable obligor (that is not itself an obligor) that does not guarantee such Notes.\nThe indentures governing each series of Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to grant liens on our assets and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition,\nthe indentures limit, as applicable, the ability of the Issuer and Guarantors to merge, consolidate or sell, convey, transfer or lease our or their properties and assets substantially as an entirety under certain circumstances. The covenants contained in the indentures do not restrict the Companys ability to pay dividends or distributions to stockholders.\nThe guarantee obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes are also subject to certain limitations and terms similar to those applicable to other guarantees of similar instruments, including that (i) the guarantees are subject to fraudulent transfer and conveyance laws and (ii) the obligations of each Guarantor under its guarantee of each series of Notes will be limited to the maximum amount as will result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its guarantee of such Notes not to be deemed to constitute a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal or state law.\nUnder each indenture governing one or more series of the Notes, a Guarantor Subsidiary will be automatically and unconditionally released from its guarantee upon consummation of any transaction permitted under the applicable indenture resulting in such Guarantor Subsidiary ceasing to be an obligor (either as issuer or guarantor). Under the indentures, the guarantee of the Parent will be automatically released and will terminate upon the merger of the Parent with or into the Issuer or another guarantor, the consolidation of the Parent with the Issuer or another guarantor or the transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Parent to the Issuer or a guarantor. In addition, if the Issuer exercises its defeasance or covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes of a series in accordance with the terms of the applicable indenture, each guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released from its guarantee of the Notes of such series and all its obligations under the applicable indenture.\nThe Issuer and each Guarantor are holding companies that conduct substantially all of their business through subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of the Issuers indebtedness, including the Notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by the Issuers and each Guarantors subsidiaries, as applicable, and their ability to make such cash available to the Issuer and the Guarantors, as applicable, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. The Issuers and the Guarantors subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable them to make payments in respect of their obligations, including with respect to the Notes in the case of the Issuer and the guarantees in the case of the Guarantors. Each of the Issuers and the Guarantors subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit the Issuers and the Guarantors ability to obtain cash from their subsidiaries. In the event that the Issuer and the Guarantors do not receive distributions from their subsidiaries, the Issuer and the Guarantors may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on their obligations, including with respect to the Notes and the guarantees.\nPursuant to amended Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, the summarized financial information below is presented for the Obligor Group on a combined basis after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions among the Obligor Group and equity in earnings from and investments in the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. The summarized financial information below should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements contained herein, as the summarized financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations or financial position had the subsidiaries operated as independent entities (in millions).\nSUMMARIZED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNet sales to unrelated parties\n$\n1,568.5\nNet sales to non-Guarantor Subsidiaries\n$\n1,239.5\nGross profit\n$\n1,092.6\nInterest expense, net with non-Guarantor Subsidiaries\n$\n(172.7\n)\nNet loss and net loss attributable to the Obligor Group (1)\n$\n(37.7\n)\n(1)Includes a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $107.8 million.\nSUMMARIZED BALANCE SHEETS\nSeptember 30,\nASSETS\nTotal current assets\n$\n192.4\n$\n227.4\nNoncurrent amounts due from non-\nGuarantor Subsidiaries\n$\n262.2\n$\n370.1\nOther noncurrent assets (1)\n1,607.9\n1,812.8\nTotal noncurrent assets\n$\n1,870.1\n$\n2,182.9\nLIABILITIES\nCurrent amounts due to non-\nGuarantor Subsidiaries\n$\n1,106.2\n$\n2,253.5\nOther current liabilities\n427.4\n144.5\nTotal current liabilities\n$\n1,533.6\n$\n2,398.0\nNoncurrent amounts due to non-\nGuarantor Subsidiaries\n$\n6,472.6\n$\n3,097.5\nOther noncurrent liabilities\n7,056.6\n6,872.7\nTotal noncurrent liabilities\n$\n13,529.2\n$\n9,970.2\n(1)Other noncurrent assets include aggregate goodwill and intangibles, net of $1,395.5 million and $1,601.2 million as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively.\nDEFINITIONS AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nDefinitions\nWe calculate cost savings as the year-over-year change in certain costs incurred for manufacturing, procurement, logistics, and SG&A, in each case excluding the impact of economic downtime and inflation. Cost savings achieved to date may not recur in future periods, and estimates of future savings are subject to change.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP). However, management believes certain non-GAAP financial measures provide additional meaningful financial information that may be relevant when assessing our ongoing performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we present may differ from similarly captioned measures presented by other companies.\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share. Management believes these measures provide our management, board of directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate our performance because they exclude restructuring and other costs, net, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, business systems transformation costs and other specific items that management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of the business. We and our board of directors use this information when making financial, operating and planning decisions and when evaluating our performance relative to other periods. We believe that the most directly comparable GAAP measures to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share are Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders and (Loss) earnings per diluted share, respectively. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview - Business Systems Transformation for additional information regarding our business systems transformation.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share to (Loss) earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP measure (in dollars per share) for the periods indicated.\nYears Ended September 30,\n(Loss) earnings per diluted share\n$\n(6.44\n)\n$\n3.61\nGoodwill impairment\n7.12\n-\nRestructuring and other costs, net\n2.53\n1.11\nWork stoppage costs\n0.24\n-\nBusiness systems transformation costs\n0.23\n0.02\nLosses at closed facilities\n0.13\n0.01\nLoss on consolidation of previously held equity\nmethod investment net of deferred taxes\n0.09\n-\nAcquisition accounting inventory related\nadjustments\n0.04\n-\nMineral rights impairment\n-\n0.08\nAccelerated depreciation on certain facility closures\n-\n0.02\nGain on sale of RTS and Chattanooga\n(0.72\n)\n-\nGain on sale of unconsolidated entities, net\n(0.07\n)\n-\nMultiemployer pension withdrawal (income) expense\n(0.04\n)\n0.01\n(Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt\n(0.03\n)\n0.02\nBrazil indirect tax claim\n(0.02\n)\n-\nGain on sale of two uncoated recycled\npaperboard mills\n(0.02\n)\n-\nMEPP liability adjustment due to interest rates\n-\n(0.10\n)\nRansomware recovery costs, net of insurance proceeds\n-\n(0.02\n)\nAdjustment to reflect adjusted earnings on a fully diluted\nbasis\n(0.02\n)\n-\nAdjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share\n$\n3.02\n$\n4.76\nThe as reported results in the table below for Pre-Tax, Tax and Net of Tax are equivalent to the line items (Loss) income before income taxes, Income tax benefit (expense) and Consolidated net (loss) income, respectively, as reported on the consolidated statements of operations.

For more information on our business systems transformation see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview - Business Systems Transformation.\nWe also use the non-GAAP financial measure Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, along with other measures such as Adjusted EBITDA (a GAAP measure of segment performance our CODM uses to evaluate our segment results), to evaluate our overall performance. The composition of Adjusted EBITDA is not addressed or prescribed by GAAP.\nManagement believes that the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is \"Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders\". Management believes this measure provides our management, board of directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate our performance because it excludes restructuring and other costs, net, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, Gain on sale of RTS and Chattanooga, business systems transformation costs and other specific items that management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of the business.

See Note 8. Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWe have prepared our accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities reported. Certain significant accounting policies are described in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThese critical accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require some of managements most subjective and complex judgments. The accounting for these\nmatters involves the making of estimates based on current facts, circumstances and assumptions that, in managements judgment, could change in a manner that would materially affect managements future estimates with respect to such matters and, accordingly, could cause our future reported financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from those that we are currently reporting based on managements current estimates.\nGoodwill\nWe review the carrying value of our goodwill annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value as set forth in ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\"ASC 350\"). We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component.\nASC 350 allows an optional qualitative assessment, prior to a quantitative assessment test, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. We generally do not attempt a qualitative assessment and move directly to the quantitative test. As part of the quantitative test, we utilize the present value of expected cash flows or, as appropriate, a combination of the present value of expected cash flows and the guideline public company method to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units. This present value model requires management to estimate future cash flows, the timing of these cash flows, and a discount rate (based on a weighted average cost of capital), which represents the time value of money and the inherent risk and uncertainty of the future cash flows. Factors that management must estimate when performing this step in the process include, among other items, sales volume, prices, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. The assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are consistent with the assumptions that the reporting units use for internal planning purposes, which we believe would be generally consistent with that of a market participant. If we determine that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If we determine that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we measure the goodwill impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value, but not in excess of the total amount of goodwill allocated to the respective reporting unit, as required under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. We describe our accounting policy for goodwill further in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Goodwill of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn fiscal 2023, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $1,893.0 million ($1,821.8 million after-tax) associated with our interim goodwill impairment analysis completed in the second quarter. See Note 8. Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing. We considered factors such as, but not limited to, our expectations for macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and financial performance, including planned revenue, earnings and capital investments of each reporting unit. The discount rate used for each reporting unit ranged from 9.5% to 14.5%. We used perpetual growth rates ranging from 0.0% to 1.0%. All reporting units that have goodwill were noted to have a fair value that exceeded their carrying values. The fair value of our Consumer Packaging reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 30%. However, our Corrugated Packaging and Distribution reporting units had fair values that exceeded their respective carrying values by less than 10%. Our Corrugated Packaging reporting unit had a narrow fair value cushion due to the goodwill impairment charge recorded for the reporting unit in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and the fair value accounting related to the Mexico Acquisition.\nIf we had concluded that it was appropriate to increase the discount rate we used by 100 basis points, the fair value of only our Consumer Packaging reporting unit would have continued to exceed its carrying value. In our fiscal 2023 annual goodwill impairment analysis, projected future cash flows for the Corrugated Packaging and Distribution reporting units were discounted at 9.5% and 14.5%, respectively. Based on the discounted cash flow model and holding other valuation assumptions constant, the discount rates for Corrugated Packaging and Distribution reporting units would have to be increased to 9.9% and 15.4%, respectively, in order for the estimated fair value of the reporting units to fall below their carrying values.\nAt September 30, 2023, the Corrugated Packaging, Consumer Packaging and Distribution reporting units had $2,603.7 million, $1,506.6 million and $138.4 million of goodwill, respectively. Our Global Paper reporting unit had no goodwill. Because the fair values of the Corrugated Packaging and Distribution reporting units are not substantially more than their carrying values, these reporting units have greater risk of future impairments should\nwe experience adverse changes in our assumptions, estimates, or market factors. If the assumptions, estimates, and market factors underlying our fair value determinations change adversely, we may be exposed to additional impairment charges, which could be material. Additionally, there are certain risks inherent to our operations as described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nSubsequent to our annual test, we monitored industry economic trends through the end of fiscal 2023 and determined no additional testing for goodwill impairment was warranted. We have not made any material changes to our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe follow the provisions included in ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment in determining whether the carrying value of any of our long-lived assets, including amortizable intangibles other than goodwill, is impaired. We review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset might not be recoverable. If we determine that indicators of impairment are present, we determine whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the potentially impaired assets are less than the carrying value. This requires management to estimate future cash flows through operations over the remaining useful life of the asset and its ultimate disposition. The assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are consistent with the assumptions we use for internal planning purposes, updated to reflect current expectations. If our estimated undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, we estimate the fair value of the asset and record an impairment charge if the carrying value is greater than the fair value of the asset. We estimate fair value using discounted cash flows, observable prices for similar assets, or other valuation techniques.\nOur judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors, market conditions and operational performance. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired. Evaluating impairment also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows, which also require judgment by management.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, reflect managements best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, recent financial operations and their associated valuation allowances, if any. We use significant judgment in (i) determining whether a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination and (ii) measuring the tax benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We do not record any benefit for the tax positions where we do not meet the more likely than not initial recognition threshold. Income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized. We generally recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Resolution of the uncertain tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows or materially benefit our results of operations in future periods depending upon their ultimate resolution. A 1% change in our effective tax rate would have increased or decreased tax expense by approximately $17 million for fiscal 2023. A 1% change in our effective tax rate used to compute deferred tax liabilities and assets, as recorded on the September 30, 2023 consolidated balance sheet, would have increased or decreased tax expense by approximately $100 million for fiscal 2023.\nPension\nThe funded status of our qualified and non-qualified U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans increased $170.5 million in fiscal 2023. Our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans were overfunded by $450.0 million as of September 30, 2023. Our non-U.S. pension plans were under funded by $41.7 million as of September 30, 2023. Our U.S. pension plan benefit obligations were positively impacted in fiscal 2023 primarily by a 61-basis point increase in the discount rate compared to the prior measurement date. The non-U.S. pension plan obligations were positively impacted in fiscal 2023 by a 73-basis point increase in the discount rate compared to the prior measurement date.\nThe determination of pension obligations and pension expense requires various assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts, such as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates, projected future compensation increases and mortality rates for each of our plans. These assumptions are determined annually in conjunction with our actuary. The accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts, circumstances and assumptions that, in managements judgment, could change in a manner that would materially affect managements future estimates with respect to such matters and, accordingly, could cause our future reported financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from those that we are currently reporting based on managements current estimates.\nA 25-basis point change in the discount rate, compensation level, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and interest crediting rate, factoring in our corridor (as defined herein) as appropriate, would have had the following effect on fiscal 2023 pension expense (amounts in the table in parentheses reflect additional income, in millions):\nPension Plans\n25 Basis\nPoint\nIncrease\n25 Basis\nPoint\nDecrease\nDiscount rate\n$\n(8.1\n)\n$\n8.3\nCompensation level\n$\n0.2\n$\n(0.2\n)\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets\n$\n(12.2\n)\n$\n12.2\nInterest crediting rate\n$\n0.3\n$\n(0.3\n)\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1.

Item 7A.\tQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in, among other things, interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information. We aim to identify and understand these risks and then implement strategies to manage them. When evaluating these strategies, we evaluate the fundamentals of each market, our sensitivity to movements in pricing, and underlying accounting and business implications. Our chief executive officer or chief financial officer must approve the execution of all transactions contemplated in accordance with our Financial and Commodity Risk Management Corporate Policy. The sensitivity analyses we present below do not consider the effect of possible adverse changes in the general economy, nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. We may not be successful in managing these risks.\nContainerboard and Paperboard Shipments\nWe are exposed to market risk related to our sales of containerboard and paperboard. We sell a significant portion of our mill production and converted products pursuant to contracts that provide that prices are either fixed for specified terms or provide for price adjustments based on negotiated terms, including changes in specified index prices. We have the capacity to annually ship approximately 10.6 million tons from our containerboard mills and approximately 4.0 million tons from our paperboard mills, although our mill system operating rates may vary from year to year due to changes in market and other factors. Including a partial year adjustment to capacity to reflect footprint actions, where appropriate, our simple average mill system operating rates for the last three fiscal years averaged 88%. A hypothetical $10 per ton change in the price of containerboard and paperboard throughout the year based on our capacity would impact our sales by approximately $106 million and $40 million, respectively.\nEnergy\nEnergy is one of the most significant costs of our mill operations. The cost of natural gas (typically measured in one million British Thermal Units (\"MMBtu\")), coal, oil, electricity and purchased biomass fuel at times has fluctuated significantly. Energy is one of the most significant costs of our mill operations. In our recycled paperboard mills, we\nuse primarily natural gas and electricity, supplemented at certain mills with fuel oil, to generate steam used in the paper making process. In our virgin fiber mills, we use biomass, natural gas, fuel oil and coal to generate steam used in the pulping and paper making processes and to generate some or all the electricity used on site. We primarily use purchased electricity and natural gas to operate our converting facilities. We generally purchase these products from suppliers at market or tariff rates. Our energy costs decreased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. From time to time, we use commodity contracts to hedge energy exposures, as discussed in more detail below.\nWe spent approximately $1,164 million and $1,263 million on all energy sources in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively to operate our facilities. Natural gas and electricity each account for approximately 30% to 50% of our energy purchases depending upon pricing. We consumed approximately 87 million MMBtu of natural gas in fiscal 2023, although the amount of energy we consume may vary from year to year due to production levels and other factors. A hypothetical 10% change in the price of energy throughout the year would impact our cost of energy by approximately $116 million based on fiscal 2023 pricing and consumption.\nRecycled Fiber\nRecycled fiber is the principal raw material we use in the production of recycled paperboard and a portion of our containerboard. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, we consumed approximately 6.4 million and 5.7 million tons of recycled fiber, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2023 was primarily associated with the operations acquired in the Mexico Acquisition. Our purchases of old corrugated containers and double-lined kraft clippings account for our largest recycled fiber costs and made up approximately 85% to 90% of our recycled fiber purchases in fiscal 2023. The remaining 10% to 15% of our recycled fiber purchases consisted of a number of other grades of recycled paper. The mix of recycled fiber may vary due to factors such as market demand, availability and pricing. Recycled fiber prices can fluctuate significantly and were lower in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. While the amount of recycled fiber we consume may vary from year to year due to production levels and other factors, based on fiscal 2023 recycled fiber usage, adjusted for a full year of the operations acquired in the Mexico Acquisition, we would expect to consume approximately 6.5 million tons of recycled fiber. A hypothetical $10 per ton change in recycled fiber prices for a fiscal year would impact our costs by approximately $65 million.\nVirgin Fiber\nVirgin fiber is the principal raw material we use in the production of a portion of our containerboard, bleached paperboard and market pulp. While virgin fiber prices have generally been more stable than recycled fiber prices, they also fluctuate, particularly due to significant changes in weather, such as during prolonged periods of heavy rain or drought, or during housing construction slowdowns or accelerations. Virgin fiber prices were relatively flat in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. A hypothetical 10% change in virgin fiber prices in our mills for a fiscal year would impact our costs by approximately $130 million.\nFreight\nInbound and outbound freight is a significant expenditure for us. Factors that influence our freight expense include distance between our shipping and delivery locations, distance from customers and suppliers, mode of transportation (rail, truck, intermodal and ocean) and freight rates, which are influenced by supply and demand and fuel costs, primarily diesel. We experienced higher freight costs and some distribution delays in both fiscal 2023 and 2022. A hypothetical 10% change in freight costs for fiscal 2023 and 2022 would have impacted our costs by approximately $188 million and $220 million, respectively.\nInterest Rates\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily as a result of our short-term and long-term debt. As discussed below, we may from time to time use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate characteristics of a portion of our outstanding debt. Based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt at September 30, 2023 and 2022, if market interest rates change an average of 100 basis points, our annual interest expense would be impacted by approximately $21 million and $10 million, respectively. We determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs. This analysis does not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment.\nDerivative Instruments / Forward Contracts\nIn fiscal 2023 and 2022, we entered into various natural gas commodity derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. Therefore, the entire change in fair value of the financial derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction, and in the same period or periods during which the forecasted transaction affects earnings. At September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the notional amount of our natural gas commodity derivatives was 22.0 million and 18.3 million MMBtu, respectively. Based on our open contracts as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the effect of a 10% change in the price per MMBtu, other than for the first period which was already priced, would impact Cost of goods sold by approximately $6 million and $10 million, respectively.\nWe periodically may issue and settle foreign currency denominated debt, exposing us to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates between loan issue and loan repayment dates and changes in spot exchange rates on open balances at each balance sheet date. From time to time, we may use foreign exchange contracts to hedge these exposures with terms of generally one to three months. At September 30, 2023, there were no foreign exchange contract derivatives outstanding. At September 30, 2022, the notional amount of our foreign currency exchange contract derivative was 8.0 billion Mexican pesos ($389.9 million). Based on the open foreign exchange contracts as of September 30, 2022, the effect of a 1% change in exchange rates would impact Other (expense) income, net by approximately $4 million. Although foreign currency sensitive instruments expose us to market risk, fluctuations in the value of these instruments are mitigated by expected offsetting fluctuations in the foreign currency denominated debt exposures.\nWe periodically may also enter into interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with a portion of our outstanding debt but currently have no active interest rate swaps. Interest rate swaps are either designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of forecasted floating interest payments on variable rate debt or fair value hedges of fixed rate debt, or we may elect not to treat them as accounting hedges. We may enter into swaps or forward contracts on certain commodities to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases or sales of those commodities.\nSee Note 16. Derivatives and Note 20. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our derivative instruments.\nPension Plans\nOur pension plans are influenced by trends in the financial markets and the regulatory environment, among other factors. Adverse general stock market trends and falling interest rates increase plan costs and liabilities. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, factoring in our corridor as appropriate, the effect of a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have reduced pre-tax income by approximately $8 million and $8 million, respectively. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, the effect of a 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have increased pre-tax income by $8 million and decreased pre-tax income by $5 million, respectively. Similarly, MEPPs in which we participate could experience similar circumstances which could impact our funding requirements and therefore expenses. See Note 6. Retirement Plans - Multiemployer Plans of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nForeign Currency\nWe predominately operate in markets in the U.S. but derived 24.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2023 from outside the U.S. through international operations, some of which were transacted in U.S. dollars. In addition, certain of our domestic operations have sales to foreign customers. Although we are impacted by the exchange rates of a number of currencies, our largest exposures are generally to the Brazilian Real, British Pound, Canadian dollar, Euro and Mexican Peso. In fiscal 2023, our largest exposures included the Mexican Peso, Brazilian Real and British Pound.\nIn conducting our foreign operations, we also make intercompany sales and receive royalties and dividends denominated in different currencies. These activities expose us to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Flows of foreign currencies into and out of our operations are generally stable and regularly occurring and are recorded at fair market value in our financial statements.\nAt times, certain of our foreign subsidiaries have U.S. dollar-denominated external debt. In these instances, we may hedge the non-functional currency exposure with derivatives. We issue intercompany loans to and receive foreign cash deposits from our foreign subsidiaries in their local currencies, exposing us to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates between loan issue and loan repayment dates and changes in spot exchange rates from deposits. From time to time, we may use foreign-exchange hedge contracts with terms of generally less than one year to hedge these exposures. Although our derivative and other foreign currency sensitive instruments expose us to market risk, fluctuations in the value of these instruments are mitigated by expected offsetting fluctuations in the matched exposures.\nDuring fiscal 2023 and 2022, the effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies to which we have exposure compared to the U.S. dollar would have impacted our income before income taxes by approximately $12 million and $36 million, respectively.\nDuring fiscal 2023 and 2022, the effect of a hypothetical 1% change in exchange rates would have impacted accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately $50 million and $32 million, respectively. This impact does not consider the effects of a stronger or weaker U.S. dollar on our ability to compete for export business or the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Changes in foreign exchange rates could impact the price and the demand for our products; for instance, a strengthening U.S. dollar may cause exports to become more expensive to foreign customers that have to pay for them in other currencies.

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nUnless the context otherwise requires, we, us, our, WestRock and the Company refer to WestRock Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and its partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries.\nWestRock is a multinational provider of sustainable fiber-based paper and packaging solutions. We partner with our customers to provide differentiated, sustainable paper and packaging solutions that help them win in the marketplace. Our team members support customers around the world from our operating and business locations in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia.\nOn September 29, 2023, we completed the sale of our Seven Hills mill joint venture in Lynchburg, VA and received $11.0 million of cash proceeds, subject to certain customary adjustments, and recorded an aggregate pre-tax net gain on sale of $4.3 million; $7.6 million was recorded in the Equity in income of unconsolidated entities line item in our consolidated statements of operations that was partially offset by a $3.3 million loss on sale of property, plant and equipment that was recorded in cost of goods sold.\nOn September 8, 2023, we sold our interior partitions converting operations (our ownership interest in RTS Packaging, LLC) and our Chattanooga, TN uncoated recycled paperboard mill to our joint venture partner and received $318.2 million of net cash proceeds, including a preliminary working capital adjustment and other customary adjustments. We recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $238.8 million which is recorded in \"Gain on sale of RTS and Chattanooga\" in our consolidated statements of operations, excluding divestiture costs. Divestiture costs are expensed as incurred and recorded within Restructuring and other costs, net. See Note 5. Restructuring and Other Costs, Net for additional information.\nOn June 16, 2023, we sold our ownership interest in an unconsolidated displays joint venture for $43.8 million in cash and recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $19.3 million recorded in the Equity in income of unconsolidated entities line item in our consolidated statements of operations including a de minimis adjustment in the fourth quarter.\nOn December 1, 2022, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 67.7% interest in Grupo Gondi for $969.8 million in cash and the assumption of debt. We accounted for this acquisition as a business combination resulting in its consolidation. See Note 3. Acquisitions for additional information.\nOn December 1, 2022, we sold our Eaton, IN, and Aurora, IL uncoated recycled paperboard mills for $50 million, subject to a working capital adjustment. We received proceeds of $25 million, a preliminary working capital settlement of $0.9 million and are financing the remaining $25 million. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we recorded a de minimis final working capital adjustment. Pursuant to the terms of the sale agreement, we transferred control of these mills to the buyer and recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $11.2 million in Other (expense) income, net in our consolidated statements of operations.\nTransaction Agreement with Smurfit Kappa\nOn September 12, 2023, we entered into a Transaction Agreement with Smurfit Kappa, Cepheidway Limited (to be renamed Smurfit WestRock plc), ListCo and Merger Sub. The Transaction Agreement provides, among other things, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, that (a) pursuant to the Scheme each issued ordinary share of Smurfit Kappa will be exchanged for one ListCo Share, as a result of which Smurfit Kappa will become a wholly owned subsidiary of ListCo, and (b) following the implementation of the Scheme, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of ListCo. As a result of the Merger, each share of our Common Stock, with certain exceptions, will be converted into the right to receive one ListCo Share and $5.00 in cash. All shares owned by the Company, any Company subsidiary, Smurfit Kappa, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor. The Transaction Agreement also provides a mechanism for converting outstanding Company equity awards to ListCo awards. The Transaction is\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nexpected to close in the second calendar quarter of 2024, conditional upon regulatory approvals, shareholder approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions. We expect that the ListCo shares will be (i) registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and listed on the NYSE and (ii) listed on the FCA and admitted to trading on the main market for listed securities of LSE. Shares of our Common Stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act.\nThe Transaction is subject to certain conditions set forth in the Transaction Agreement, including, but not limited to: certain regulatory clearances, approval by the shareholders and stockholders of both companies (75% or more for Smurfit Kappa shareholders and a majority for our stockholders), the registration statement for the offer of ListCo Shares being declared effective by the SEC and the approval of the ListCo Shares for listing on the NYSE.\nThe Transaction Agreement contains certain termination rights for both parties. Upon termination of the Transaction Agreement under specified circumstances, including if our board changes or withdraws its recommendation to our stockholders or willfully breaches its non-solicitation covenant, we will be required to make a payment to Smurfit Kappa equal to $147 million in cash. If the Transaction Agreement is terminated in connection with the failure to obtain our stockholders approval, we will be required to make a payment to Smurfit Kappa equal to $57 million in cash. Smurfit Kappa will be required to make payments to us in connection with the termination of the Transaction Agreement under specified circumstances.\nThe foregoing summary of the Transaction Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Transaction Agreement.\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of WestRock and our partially owned subsidiaries for which we have a controlling financial interest, including variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary.\nEquity investments in which we exercise significant influence but do not control and are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for as equity method investments. Investments without a readily determinable value in which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under the measurement alternative (i.e., cost less impairment, adjusted for any qualifying observable price changes). Our investments accounted for under the equity method or the measurement alternative method are not material either individually or in the aggregate. We have eliminated all significant intercompany accounts and transactions. See Note 8. Segment Information for additional information on our equity method investments.\nReclassifications and Adjustments\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.\nImmaterial Presentation Correction\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we evaluated our financing facilities, determined that the borrowings and repayments for certain facilities should be presented gross instead of net within financing cash flow activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows, and corrected the presentation of relevant prior period amounts. The correction increased both Additions to debt and Repayments of debt by $385.0 million and increased both Additions to revolving credit facilities and Repayments of revolving credit facilities by $5.0 million in fiscal 2022, resulting in Additions to debt of $888.2 million, Repayments of debt of $1,376.5 million, Additions to revolving credit facilities of $382.4 million and Repayments of revolving credit facilities of $378.3 million, with no change to Net cash used for financing activities. The correction has no effect on the previously reported net cash flows from operating or investing activities. Additionally, the correction did not impact cash flows reported for fiscal 2021. Management does not believe the correction to be material to our current or previously filed financial statements.\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nRansomware Incident\nAs previously disclosed, on January 23, 2021, we detected a ransomware incident impacting certain of our systems. Promptly upon our detection of this incident, we initiated response and containment protocols and our security teams, supplemented by leading cyber defense firms, worked to remediate this incident. These actions included taking preventative measures, such as shutting down certain systems out of an abundance of caution, as well as taking steps to supplement existing security monitoring, scanning and protective measures. In our Form 10-Q for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we announced that all systems were back in service.\nWe undertook extensive efforts to identify, contain and recover from this incident quickly and securely. Our teams worked to maintain our business operations and minimize the impact on our customers and team members. In our Form 10-Q for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we announced that all systems were back in service. All of our mills and converting locations began producing and shipping paper and packaging at pre-ransomware levels in March 2021 or earlier. Our mill system production was approximately 115,000 tons lower than planned for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 as a result of this incident. While shipments from some of our facilities initially lagged behind production levels, this gap closed as systems were restored during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. In locations where technology issues were identified, we used alternative methods, in many cases manual methods, to process and ship orders. We systematically brought our information systems back online in a controlled, phased approach.\nWe estimated the pre-tax income impact of the lost sales and operational disruption of this incident on our operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was approximately $50 million, as well as approximately $20 million of ransomware recovery costs, primarily professional fees. In addition, we incurred approximately $9 million of ransomware recovery costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we recorded a $15 million credit for preliminary recoveries - approximately $10 million as a reduction of SG&A expense excluding intangible amortization and approximately $5 million as a reduction of Cost of goods sold. In fiscal 2022, we recorded a $57.2 million credit for ransomware insurance recoveries, recording $50.6 million of business interruption recoveries as a reduction of Cost of goods sold and $6.6 million of direct cost recoveries as a reduction of SG&A expense excluding intangible amortization. In fiscal 2023, we recorded a $10.0 million credit for ransomware insurance recoveries as a reduction of Cost of goods sold. We present ransomware recoveries received as Net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Our recoveries related to the ransomware incident are now complete.\nIn order to contain and remediate the cybersecurity incident, we engaged a leading cybersecurity defense firm to complete a forensics investigation and performed short-term mitigation actions in the latter half of 2021. Mitigations performed included the execution of a company-wide password reset and the deployment of security tooling across all our servers and workstations. Additionally, to address longer term security objectives, we developed a multi-year security and resiliency roadmap, aimed to strengthen the companys ability to detect, respond, and recover from security incidents. This roadmap included initiatives to bolster our information security posture across the enterprise, and to deploy technology and process improvements to allow for faster and more effective incident response and recovery. More specifically, key areas of focus for the resiliency roadmap included: strengthening security monitoring controls, improving security at our operating locations, automating identity and access management, expanding third-party security, modernizing the network and file and print infrastructure, and updating backup capabilities.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and the differences could be material.\nWe base our estimates on the current information available, our experiences and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience, current and expected economic conditions, pricing\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\ncycles relating to industry capacity, product mix, and in some cases, actuarial techniques. We regularly evaluate these significant factors and make adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generally recognize revenue on a point-in-time basis when the customer takes title to the goods and assumes the risks and rewards for the goods, which coincide with the transfer of control of our goods to the customer. Additionally, we manufacture certain customized products that have no alternative use to us (since they are made to specific customer specifications), and we believe that for certain customers we have a legally enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date on these products, including a reasonable profit. For products that meet these two criteria, we recognize revenue over time. This results in revenue recognition prior to the date of shipment or title transfer for these products and results in the recognition of a contract asset (unbilled receivables) with a corresponding reduction in finished goods inventory on our balance sheet.\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods. Our revenues are primarily derived from fixed consideration. However, we net provisions for discounts, returns, allowances, customer rebates and other adjustments against our gross sales. Such adjustments are based on historical experience which is consistent with the most likely method as provided in ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606).\nAs permitted by ASC 606, we have elected to treat costs associated with obtaining new contracts as expenses when incurred if the amortization period of the asset we would recognize is one year or less. We do not record interest income when the difference in timing of control transfer and customer payment is one year or less. We also account for sales and other taxes that are imposed on and concurrent with individual revenue-producing transactions between a customer and us on a net basis which excludes the taxes from our net sales.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nWe classify shipping and handling costs, such as freight to our customers destinations, as a component of cost of goods sold. When shipping and handling costs are included in the sales price charged for our products, they are recognized in net sales since we treat shipping and handling as fulfilment activities.\nCash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that mature three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents approximate fair market values. We place our cash and cash equivalents primarily with large credit-worthy banks, which limits the amount of our credit exposure.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances\nWe derive our accounts receivable from revenue earned from customers located primarily in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Given our diverse customer base, we have limited exposure to credit loss from any particular customer or industry segment, and hence we generally do not require collateral. We perform an evaluation of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in our accounts receivable at each balance sheet date. Such an evaluation includes consideration of historical loss experience, trends in customer payment frequency, present economic conditions, and judgment about the future financial health of our customers and industry sector. The average of our receivables collection is within 30 to 60 days. We are a party to accounts receivable monetization agreements to sell to third-party financial institutions all of the short-term receivables generated from certain customer trade accounts. See Note 13. Fair Value - Accounts Receivable Monetization Agreements for additional information.\nWe state accounts receivable at the amount owed by the customer, net of an allowance for estimated credit impairment losses, returns and allowances, cash discounts and other adjustments. We do not discount accounts receivable because we generally collect accounts receivable over a relatively short time. We charge off receivables when they are determined to be no longer collectible. We recorded credit impairment losses of $5.9 million and $4.6 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, and income of $9.4 million in fiscal 2021.\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following table represents a summary of the changes in the reserve for allowance for estimated credit impairment losses, returns and allowances, and cash discounts for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):\nBalance at beginning of fiscal year\n$\n66.3\n$\n68.1\n$\n66.3\nReduction in sales and charges to costs and expenses\n252.0\n261.9\n236.5\nDeductions\n(258.1\n)\n(263.7\n)\n(234.7\n)\nBalance at end of fiscal year\n$\n60.2\n$\n66.3\n$\n68.1\nInventories\nWe value our U.S. inventories at the lower of cost or market, with cost for the majority of our U.S. inventories determined on the last-in first-out (LIFO) basis. We value all other inventories at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost determined using methods that approximate cost computed on a first-in first-out inventory valuation method (FIFO) basis. These other inventories are primarily foreign inventories, distribution business inventories, spare parts inventories and certain inventoried supplies and aggregate to approximately 43% and 35% of FIFO cost of all inventory at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2023 is primarily due to the Mexico Acquisition. See Note 10. Inventories for additional information.\nPrior to the application of the LIFO method, our U.S. operating divisions use a variety of methods to estimate the FIFO cost of their finished goods inventories. Such methods include standard costs, or average costs computed by dividing the actual cost of goods manufactured by the tons produced and multiplying this amount by the tons of inventory on hand. Variances and other unusual items are analyzed to determine whether it is appropriate to include those items in the value of inventory. Examples of variances and unusual items that are considered to be current period charges include, but are not limited to, production levels, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) that are determined to be abnormal. Costs include raw materials and supplies, direct labor, indirect labor related to the manufacturing process, and depreciation and other factory overheads. Our inventoried spare parts are measured at average cost.\nLeased Assets\nWhen adopting the provisions of ASC 842, Leases we elected the package of three practical expedients permitted within the standard pursuant to which we did not reassess initial direct costs, lease classification or whether our contracts contain or are leases. We lease various real estate, including certain operating facilities, warehouses, office space and land. We also lease material handling equipment, vehicles and certain other equipment. We record our operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and liabilities at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Our leases may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options to extend are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. While some leases provide for variable payments, they are not included in the ROU assets and liabilities because they are not based on an index or rate. Variable payments for real estate leases primarily relate to common area maintenance, insurance, taxes and utilities. Variable payments for equipment, vehicles and leases within supply agreements primarily relate to usage, repairs, and maintenance. As the implicit rate is not readily determinable for our leases, we apply a portfolio approach using an estimated incremental borrowing rate to determine the initial present value of lease payments over the lease terms on a collateralized basis over a similar term, which is based on market and company specific information. We use the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjust that rate to approximate a collateralized rate, and apply the rate based on the currency of the lease, which is updated on a monthly basis for measurement of new lease liabilities.\nWe have made an accounting policy election to not recognize an ROU asset and liability for leases with a term of 12 months or less unless the lease includes an option to renew or purchase the underlying asset that we are reasonably certain to exercise. In addition, the Company has applied the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all of the Company's leases. See Note 15. Leases for additional information.\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nWe record property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes major expenditures for improvements and replacements that extend useful lives, increase capacity, increase revenues or reduce costs, while normal maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. For financial reporting purposes, we provide depreciation and amortization primarily on a straight-line method generally over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\nBuildings and building improvements\n15-40 years\nMachinery and equipment\n3-25 years\nTransportation equipment\n3-8 years\nGenerally, our machinery and equipment have estimated useful lives between 3 and 25 years; however, select portions of machinery and equipment primarily at our mills have estimated useful lives up to 44 years. Greater than 90% of the cost of our mill assets have useful lives of 25 years or less. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the asset life or the lease term, generally between 3 and 10 years.\nGoodwill\nIn accordance with ASC 350, we review the carrying value of our goodwill annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. However, two or more components of an operating segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. The amount of goodwill acquired in a business combination that is assigned to one or more reporting units as of the acquisition date is the excess of the purchase price of the acquired businesses (or portion thereof) included in the reporting unit, over the fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed from a market participant perspective. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit(s) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination even though other assets or liabilities of the acquired entity may not be assigned to that reporting unit. We determine recoverability by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill applies to the carrying value, including goodwill, of that reporting unit. We determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the present value of expected cash flows (Income Approach) or, as appropriate, a combination of the Income Approach and the guideline public company method (Market Approach).\nASC 350 allows an optional qualitative assessment, prior to a quantitative assessment test, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. We generally do not attempt a qualitative assessment and move directly to the quantitative test. As part of the quantitative test, we utilize the present value of expected cash flows or, as appropriate, a combination of the present value of expected cash flows and the guideline public company method to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units. This present value model requires management to estimate future cash flows, the timing of these cash flows, and a discount rate (based on a weighted average cost of capital), which represents the time value of money and the inherent risk and uncertainty of the future cash flows. Factors that management must estimate when performing this step in the process include, among other items, sales volume, prices, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. The assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are consistent with the assumptions that the reporting units use for internal planning purposes, which we believe would be generally consistent with that of a market participant. Under the guideline public company method, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on published EBITDA multiples of comparable public companies with similar operations and economic characteristics. The fair values determined by the discounted cash flow and guideline public company methods are weighted to arrive at the concluded fair value of the reporting unit. However, in instances where comparisons to our peers is less meaningful, no weight is placed on the guideline public company method to arrive at the concluded fair value of the reporting unit. If we determine that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If we determine that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we measure the goodwill impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nunits carrying amount over its fair value, but not in excess of the total amount of goodwill allocated to the respective reporting unit, as required under ASU 2017-04 Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2023, due to the sustained decrease in our market capitalization and the further deterioration of macroeconomic conditions, including the impact of soft demand, pricing pressure and elevated inflation, which negatively affected our long-term forecasts in certain segments, we concluded that impairment indicators existed. As a result, we completed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test in conjunction with our normal quarterly reporting process. Consistent with past practice, the estimated fair value of our reporting units was determined using a combination of Income Approach and the Market Approach. These fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors.\nIn fiscal 2023, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $1,893.0 million ($1,821.8 million after-tax) associated with our interim goodwill impairment analysis completed in the second quarter. See Note 8. Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing. We considered factors such as, but not limited to, our expectations for macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and financial performance, including planned revenue, earnings and capital investments of each reporting unit. The discount rate used for each reporting unit ranged from 9.5% to 14.5%. We used perpetual growth rates ranging from 0.0% to 1.0%. All reporting units that have goodwill were noted to have a fair value that exceeded their carrying values. The fair value of our Consumer Packaging reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 30%. However, our Corrugated Packaging and Distribution reporting units had fair values that exceeded their respective carrying values by less than 10%. Our Corrugated Packaging reporting unit had a narrow fair value cushion due to the goodwill impairment charge recorded for the reporting unit in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and the fair value accounting related to the Mexico Acquisition.\nIf we had concluded that it was appropriate to increase the discount rate we used by 100 basis points, the fair value of only our Consumer Packaging reporting unit would have continued to exceed its carrying value. In our fiscal 2023 annual goodwill impairment analysis, projected future cash flows for the Corrugated Packaging and Distribution reporting units were discounted at 9.5% and 14.5%, respectively. Based on the discounted cash flow model and holding other valuation assumptions constant, the discount rates for Corrugated Packaging and Distribution reporting units would have to be increased to 9.9% and 15.4%, respectively, in order for the estimated fair value of the reporting units to fall below their carrying values.\nAt September 30, 2023, the Corrugated Packaging, Consumer Packaging and Distribution reporting units had $2,603.7 million, $1,506.6 million and $138.4 million of goodwill, respectively. Our Global Paper reporting unit had no goodwill. Because the fair values of the Corrugated Packaging and Distribution reporting units are not substantially more than their carrying values, these reporting units have greater risk of future impairments should we experience adverse changes in our assumptions, estimates, or market factors. If the assumptions, estimates, and market factors underlying our fair value determinations change adversely, we may be exposed to additional impairment charges, which could be material. Additionally, there are certain risks inherent to our operations as described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nSubsequent to our annual test, we monitored industry economic trends through the end of fiscal 2023 and determined no additional testing for goodwill impairment was warranted. We have not made any material changes to our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe follow the provisions included in ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment in determining whether the carrying value of any of our long-lived assets, including amortizable intangibles other than goodwill, is impaired. The ASC 360 test is a three-step test for assets that are held and used as that term is defined by ASC 360. We determine whether indicators of impairment are present. We review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset might not be recoverable. If we determine that indicators of impairment are present, we determine whether the estimated undiscounted cash\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nflows for the potentially impaired assets are less than the carrying value. This requires management to estimate future cash flows through operations over the remaining useful life of the asset and its ultimate disposition. The assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are consistent with the assumptions we use for internal planning purposes, updated to reflect current expectations. If our estimated undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, we estimate the fair value of the asset and record an impairment charge if the carrying value is greater than the fair value of the asset. We estimate fair value using discounted cash flows, observable prices for similar assets, or other valuation techniques. We record assets classified as held for sale at the lower of their carrying value or estimated fair value less anticipated costs to sell. See Note 5. Restructuring and Other Costs, Net for additional information on long-lived asset write-offs included in restructuring charges recorded in conjunction with our decision to permanently cease operations at our Tacoma, WA and North Charleston, SC containerboard mills. Our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, remain recoverable.\nIncluded in our long-lived assets are certain identifiable intangible assets. These intangible assets are amortized based on the approximate pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or straight-line if the pattern was not reliably determinable. Estimated useful lives range from 2 to 40 years and have a weighted average life of approximately 15.9 years.\nOur judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors, market conditions and operational performance. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired. Evaluating impairment also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows, which also require judgment by management. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCloud Computing Arrangements\nWe utilize cloud computing arrangements such as hosting arrangements which are service contracts, whereby we gain remote access to use software hosted by the vendor or another third party on an as-needed basis for a period of time in exchange for a subscription fee. Subscription fees are usually prepaid and recorded in operating expense over the related subscription period. Implementation costs for cloud computing arrangements are capitalized within Other current assets or Other noncurrent assets if certain criteria are met and consist of internal and external costs directly attributable to developing and configuring cloud computing software for its intended use. Amortization of capitalized implementation costs is recorded as operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the cloud computing arrangement, which is the non-cancellable period of the agreement, together with periods covered by renewal options which we are reasonably certain to exercise. The unamortized implementation costs related to our cloud computing arrangements were $51.7 million, $4.1 million and $1.1 million at September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2023 was related to our business systems transformation project.\nRestructuring and Other Costs, Net\nOur restructuring and other costs, net include primarily items such as restructuring portions of our operations, acquisition costs, integration costs and divestiture costs. We have restructured portions of our operations from time to time, have current restructuring initiatives taking place, and it is likely that we will engage in future restructuring activities.\nWhen we close a facility, if necessary, we recognize a write-down to reduce the carrying value of related property, plant and equipment and lease ROU assets to their fair value and record charges for severance and other employee-related costs. We reduce the carrying value of the assets classified as held for sale to their estimated fair value less cost to sell. Any subsequent change in fair value less cost to sell prior to disposition is recognized as it is identified; however, no gain is recognized in excess of the cumulative loss previously recorded unless the actual selling price exceeds the original carrying value upon its ultimate sale. For facility closures, we also generally expect to record costs for equipment relocation, facility carrying costs and costs to terminate a lease or contract before the end of its term.\nAlthough specific circumstances vary, our strategy has generally been to consolidate our sales and operations into large well-equipped facilities that operate at high utilization rates and take advantage of available capacity\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\ncreated by operational excellence initiatives and/or further optimize our system following mergers and acquisitions or a changing business environment. Therefore, we generally transfer a substantial portion of each closed facility's production to our other facilities. We believe these actions have allowed us to more effectively manage our business.\nIdentifying and calculating the cost to exit operations requires certain assumptions to be made, the most significant of which are anticipated future liabilities, including severance costs, contractual obligations, and the adjustments of property, plant and equipment and lease ROU assets to their fair value. We believe our estimates are reasonable, considering our knowledge of the industries we operate in, previous experience in exiting activities and valuations we may obtain from independent third parties. Although our estimates have been reasonably accurate in the past, significant judgment is required, and these estimates and assumptions may change as additional information becomes available and facts or circumstances change. See Note 5. Restructuring and Other Costs, Net for additional information, including a description of the type of costs incurred.\nBusiness Combinations\nFrom time to time, we may enter into business combinations. In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. We measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities including those related to debt, pensions and other postretirement plans, uncertain tax positions, contingent consideration and contingencies. Significant estimates and assumptions include subjective and/or complex judgments regarding items such as discount rates, customer attrition rates, economic lives and other factors, including estimating future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets.\nThe acquisition method of accounting also requires us to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record future impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be increased or decreased, or the acquired asset could be impaired.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe estimate fair values in accordance with ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement. ASC 820 provides a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures required about fair value measurements. Specifically, ASC 820 sets forth a definition of fair value and a hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to level 1 inputs.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to level 3 inputs.\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nWe incorporate credit valuation adjustments to reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in our fair value measurements.\nFinancial instruments not recognized at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, certain other current assets, short-term debt, accounts payable, certain other current liabilities and long-term debt. With the exception of long-term debt, the carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. The fair values of our long-term debt are estimated using quoted market prices or are based on the discounted value of future cash flows. We disclose the fair value of long-term debt in Note 14. Debt and our pension and postretirement assets and liabilities in Note 6. Retirement Plans. We have, or from time to time may have, financial instruments recognized at fair value including supplemental retirement savings plans (Supplemental Plans) that are nonqualified deferred compensation plans pursuant to which assets are invested primarily in mutual funds, interest rate derivatives, commodity derivatives or other similar class of assets or liabilities, the fair value of which are not significant. We measure the fair value of our mutual fund investments based on quoted prices in active markets. Additionally, we measure our derivative contracts, if any, based on observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, spot and future commodity prices, and spot and future exchange rates.\nWe measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets and liabilities include equity method investments when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, investments for which the fair value measurement alternative is elected, assets acquired and liabilities assumed when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a merger or an acquisition or in a nonmonetary exchange, property, plant and equipment, ROU assets related to operating leases, goodwill and other intangible assets that are written down to fair value when they are held for sale or determined to be impaired. See Note 5. Restructuring and Other Costs, Net for impairments associated with restructuring activities. Given the nature of such assets and liabilities, evaluating their fair value from the perspective of a market participant is inherently complex. Assumptions and estimates about future values can be affected by a variety of internal and external factors. Changes in these factors may require us to revise our estimates and could result in future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets, or retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations. These adjustments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We discuss fair values in more detail in Note 13. Fair Value.\nDerivatives\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk, commodity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk. To manage these risks, from time to time and to varying degrees, we may enter into a variety of financial derivative transactions and certain physical commodity transactions that are determined to be derivatives. Interest rate swaps may be entered into to manage the interest rate risk associated with a portion of our outstanding debt. Interest rate swaps are either designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of forecasted floating interest payments on variable rate debt or fair value hedges of fixed rate debt, or we may elect not to treat them as accounting hedges. Swaps or forward contracts on certain commodities may be entered into to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases or sales of those commodities. In addition, certain commodity financial derivative contracts and physical commodity contracts that are determined to be derivatives may not be designated as accounting hedges because either they do not meet the criteria for treatment as accounting hedges under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC815), or we elect not to treat them as accounting hedges under ASC 815. Generally, we elect the normal purchase, normal sale scope exception for physical commodity contracts that are determined to be derivatives. We may also enter into forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates with respect to transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These also can either be designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges or not so designated. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or other speculative purposes.\nOutstanding financial derivative instruments expose us to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the derivative agreements. Our credit exposure related to these financial instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts reported as assets. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. We may enter into financial derivative contracts that may contain credit-risk-related contingent features\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nwhich could result in a counterparty requesting immediate payment or demanding immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions.\nFor financial derivative instruments that are designated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes, the entire change in fair value of the financial derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction, and in the same period or periods during which the forecasted transaction affects earnings. For financial derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges, the entire change in fair value of the financial instrument is reported immediately in current period earnings.\nWe have at times entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively modified our exposure to interest rate risk by converting a portion of our interest payments on floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis, thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. These agreements typically involved the receipt of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed interest rate payments over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amount.\nSee Note 16. Derivatives for additional information regarding our foreign currency and natural gas commodity derivatives.\nHealth Insurance\nWe are self-insured for the majority of our group health insurance costs. However, we seek to limit our health insurance costs by entering into certain stop loss insurance coverage. Due to mergers, acquisitions and other factors, we may have plans that do not include stop loss insurance. We calculate our group health insurance reserve on an undiscounted basis based on estimated reserve rates. We utilize claims lag data provided by our claims administrators to compute the required estimated reserve rate. We calculate our average monthly claims paid using the actual monthly payments during the trailing 12-month period. At that time, we also calculate our required reserve using the reserve rates discussed above. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our group health insurance costs.\nWorkers Compensation\nWe purchase large risk deductible workers compensation policies for the majority of our workers compensation liabilities that are subject to various deductibles to limit our exposure. We calculate our workers compensation reserves on an undiscounted basis based on estimated actuarially calculated development factors. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our workers' compensation costs.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. All deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent in our consolidated balance sheet.\nWe record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, recent financial operations and their associated valuation allowances, if any. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize or not realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance, which would reduce or increase the provision for income taxes, respectively.\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nCertain provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes provide that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. We use significant judgment in (i) determining whether a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination and (ii) measuring the tax benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We do not record any benefit for the tax positions where we do not meet the more likely than not initial recognition threshold. Income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Resolution of the uncertain tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows or materially benefit our results of operations in future periods depending upon their ultimate resolution.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted comprehensive tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Act. As part of the enacted Tax Act, Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) provisions were introduced that would impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. We have elected to treat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost during the year incurred.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, with tax provisions primarily focused on implementing a 15% minimum tax on global adjusted financial statement income and a 1% excise tax on share repurchases. While we are still evaluating the impact that provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act becoming effective in fiscal 2024 will have on our financial results, we do not believe the impact will be material.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nWe account for pension and other postretirement benefits in accordance with ASC 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits. Accordingly, we recognize the funded status of our pension plans as assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The funded status is the difference between our projected benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets. The determination of our obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. We describe these assumptions in Note 6. Retirement Plans, which include, among others, the discount rate, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation levels. We defer actual results that differ from our assumptions, i.e., actuarial gains and losses, and amortize the difference over future periods. Therefore, these differences generally affect our recognized expense and funding requirements in future periods. Actuarial gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from the estimates used to determine the components of net periodic pension cost and when certain assumptions used to determine the fair value of the plan assets or projected benefit obligation are updated, such as but not limited to, changes in the discount rate, plan amendments, differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets, mortality assumptions and plan remeasurement.\nThe amount of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses recognized in the current years operations is based on amortizing the unrecognized gains or losses for each plan that exceed the larger of 10% of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets, also known as the corridor. The amount of unrecognized gain or loss that exceeds the corridor is amortized over the average future service of the plan participants or the average life expectancy of inactive plan participants for plans where all or almost all of the plan participants are inactive. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and our future expense.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe recognize expense for share-based compensation plans based on the estimated fair value of the related awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Pursuant to our incentive stock plans, we can grant options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights (SAR or SARs) to employees and non-employee directors. The grants generally vest over a period of up to three years depending on the nature of the award, except for non-employee director grants, which typically vest over a period of up to one year. The majority of our awards are restricted stock units granted to employees and generally contain performance\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nor market conditions that must be met in conjunction with a service requirement for the shares to vest, others contain only a service requirement. We charge compensation expense under the plan to earnings over each awards individual vesting period. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. See Note 22. Share-Based Compensation for additional information.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe account for asset retirement obligations in accordance with ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations. A liability and an asset are recorded equal to the present value of the estimated costs associated with the retirement of long-lived assets where a legal or contractual obligation exists and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The liability is accreted over time and the asset is depreciated over the remaining life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, we recognize a gain or loss for any difference between the settlement amount and the liability recorded. We record our asset retirement obligations in Other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities.\nOur asset retirement obligations consist primarily of costs related to the closure of manufacturing facilities, and includes captive, non-hazardous solid waste landfills owned and operated by certain of our paper mills. The following table sets forth changes to the asset retirement obligations (in millions):\nBalance at beginning of fiscal year\n$\n96.0\n$\n73.6\nAccretion expense\n3.5\n2.7\nLiabilities incurred\n30.7\n25.1\nPayments\n(4.2\n)\n(4.0\n)\nRevisions in estimated cash flows\n0.8\n(1.4\n)\nForeign currency rate changes\n0.2\n-\nBalance at end of fiscal year\n$\n127.0\n$\n96.0\nLiabilities incurred for our asset retirement obligations in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 were primarily related to certain manufacturing facility closures for items such as oil and process chemical removal that were previously determined to have an indeterminate settlement date and adjustment to anticipated landfill obligations. See Note 5. Restructuring and Other Costs, Net for additional information on mill closures.\nAsset retirement obligations with indeterminate settlement dates are not recorded until such time that a reasonable estimate may be made. In the event of future closures, redesigns, or renovations of certain production facilities, it is possible that we may be required to take steps to remove certain materials from these facilities including asbestos and chemicals. Currently, any such obligations have an indeterminate settlement date, and we believe that adequate information does not exist to apply an expected-present-value technique to estimate any such potential obligations. Accordingly, we will recognize a liability for such items in the period in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate the fair value of these obligations.\nRepair and Maintenance Costs\nWe expense routine repair and maintenance costs as we incur them. We defer certain expenses we incur during planned major maintenance activities and recognize the expenses ratably over the shorter of the estimated interval until the next major maintenance activity or the life of the deferred item. This maintenance is generally performed every 12 to 24 months and has a significant impact on our results of operations in the period performed primarily due to lost production during the maintenance period. Planned major maintenance costs deferred at September 30, 2023 and 2022 were $140.9 million and $121.8 million, respectively. The assets are recorded as Other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nForeign Currency\nWe translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations from their functional currency into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange in effect as of the balance sheet date. We reflect the resulting translation adjustments in\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nequity. We translate the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations at a daily average rate prevailing for each month during the fiscal year. We include gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of foreign receivables or payables, in the consolidated statements of operations within Other (expense) income, net. We recorded a gain on foreign currency transactions of $10.8 million in fiscal 2023, while we recorded a loss on foreign currency transactions of $5.0 million and $0.7 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nEnvironmental Remediation Costs\nWe accrue for losses associated with our environmental remediation obligations when it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We generally recognize accruals for estimated losses from our environmental remediation obligations no later than completion of a remedial feasibility study and clear indication of remedial options. We adjust such accruals as further information develops or circumstances change. We recognize recoveries of our environmental remediation costs from other parties as assets when we deem their receipt probable. See Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies - Environmental.\nNew Accounting Standards - Adopted in Fiscal 2023\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832) - Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance. This ASU aims to increase the transparency of government assistance through the annual disclosure of the types of assistance, an entitys accounting for the assistance and the effect of the assistance on an entitys financial statements. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021 (fiscal 2023 for us), with early adoption permitted. We adopted the provisions of ASU 2021-10 beginning October 1, 2022. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. This ASU requires an entity to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606. This ASU aims to reduce diversity in practice and increase comparability for both the recognition and measurement of acquired revenue contracts with customers at the date of and after a business combination. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 (fiscal 2024 for us), including interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted the provisions of ASU 2021-08 beginning October 1, 2022. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This ASU provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, which adds implementation guidance to clarify certain optional expedients in Topic 848. The ASUs could be adopted after their respective issuance dates through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, which extends the period of time entities can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance under ASU 2020-04 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. See Note 14. Debt for information regarding the amendments to our credit facilities. We adopted the provisions of this optional guidance beginning October 1, 2022. The adoption of these ASUs did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNew Accounting Standards - Pending Adoption in Fiscal 2024\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.

This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 (fiscal 2024 for us), except for the amendment on roll forward information, which is effective for fiscal years\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nbeginning after December 15, 2023 (fiscal 2025 for us), each with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging - Portfolio Layer Method. This ASU expands and clarifies the portfolio layer method for fair value hedges of interest rate risk. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 (fiscal 2024 for us), including interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNew Accounting Standards - Recently Issued\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-01, Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements. This ASU requires all lessees to amortize leasehold improvements associated with common control leases over their useful life to the common control group and account for them as a transfer of assets between entities under common control at the end of the lease. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 (fiscal 2025 for us), including interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted in any annual or interim period as of the beginning of the related fiscal year. We are evaluating the impact of this ASU.\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions. This ASU clarifies that contractual sale restrictions should not be considered in measuring the fair value of equity securities. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 (fiscal 2025 for us), including interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact of this ASU.\nNote 2.\tRevenue Recognition\t\t\t\t\t\nDisaggregated Revenue\nASC 606 requires that we disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The tables below disaggregate our revenue by geographical market and product type (segment). Net sales are attributed to geographical markets based on our selling location.\nThe following tables summarize our disaggregated revenue by primary geographical markets for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):\nYear Ended September 30, 2023\nCorrugated Packaging\nConsumer Packaging\nGlobal Paper\nDistribution\nIntersegment Sales\nTotal\nU.S.\n$\n7,782.4\n$\n2,843.4\n$\n3,946.0\n$\n1,072.7\n$\n(295.6\n)\n$\n15,348.9\nCanada\n554.3\n516.1\n204.9\n11.1\n(5.4\n)\n1,281.0\nLatin America\n1,709.5\n80.9\n129.8\n176.9\n(15.3\n)\n2,081.8\nEMEA\n8.7\n1,201.2\n47.2\n-\n(1.0\n)\n1,256.1\nAsia Pacific\n-\n300.2\n42.0\n-\n-\n342.2\nTotal\n$\n10,054.9\n$\n4,941.8\n$\n4,369.9\n$\n1,260.7\n$\n(317.3\n)\n$\n20,310.0\nYear Ended September 30, 2022\nCorrugated Packaging\nConsumer Packaging\nGlobal Paper\nDistribution\nIntersegment Sales\nTotal\nU.S.\n$\n8,264.7\n$\n2,870.9\n$\n5,344.8\n$\n1,238.3\n$\n(357.2\n)\n$\n17,361.5\nCanada\n578.8\n510.0\n227.7\n16.1\n(7.5\n)\n1,325.1\nLatin America\n456.4\n194.4\n230.7\n164.5\n(0.4\n)\n1,045.6\nEMEA\n7.7\n1,079.9\n63.2\n-\n(0.3\n)\n1,150.5\nAsia Pacific\n-\n310.0\n63.8\n-\n-\n373.8\nTotal\n$\n9,307.6\n$\n4,965.2\n$\n5,930.2\n$\n1,418.9\n$\n(365.4\n)\n$\n21,256.5\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nYear Ended September 30, 2021\nCorrugated Packaging\nConsumer Packaging\nGlobal Paper\nDistribution\nIntersegment Sales\nTotal\nU.S.\n$\n7,518.8\n$\n2,463.7\n$\n4,547.7\n$\n1,105.9\n$\n(318.9\n)\n$\n15,317.2\nCanada\n519.3\n473.0\n205.2\n19.7\n(6.8\n)\n1,210.4\nLatin America\n357.3\n159.1\n100.1\n129.2\n(0.3\n)\n745.4\nEMEA\n5.1\n1,038.2\n62.7\n-\n-\n1,106.0\nAsia Pacific\n-\n299.9\n67.3\n-\n(0.1\n)\n367.1\nTotal\n$\n8,400.5\n$\n4,433.9\n$\n4,983.0\n$\n1,254.8\n$\n(326.1\n)\n$\n18,746.1\nRevenue Contract Balances\nContract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Contract assets are reduced when the control of the goods passes to the customer. Contract liabilities represent obligations to transfer goods or services to a customer for which we have received consideration. Contract liabilities are reduced once control of the goods is transferred to the customer.\nThe opening and closing balances of our contract assets and contract liabilities are as follows. Contract assets and contract liabilities are reported within Other current assets and Other current liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets (in millions).\nContract Assets\n(Short-Term)\nContract Liabilities\n(Short-Term)\nBeginning balance - October 1, 2022\n$\n244.0\n$\n13.9\nDecrease\n(2.3\n)\n(0.4\n)\nEnding balance - September 30, 2023\n$\n241.7\n$\n13.5\nPerformance Obligations and Significant Judgments\nWe primarily derive revenue from fixed consideration. Certain contracts may also include variable consideration, typically in the form of cash discounts and volume rebates. If a contract with a customer includes variable consideration, we estimate the expected cash discounts and other customer refunds based on historical experience. We concluded this method is consistent with the most likely amount method under ASC 606 and allows us to make the best estimate of the consideration we will be entitled to from customers.\nContracts or purchase orders with customers could include a single type of product or multiple types and grades of products. Regardless, the contract price with the customer is agreed to at the individual product level outlined in the customer contracts or purchase orders. Management has concluded that the prices negotiated with each individual customer are representative of the stand-alone selling price of the product.\nNote 3. Acquisitions\nWhen we obtain control of a business by acquiring its assets, or some or all of its equity interest, we account for those acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. The estimated fair values of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions are provisional and may be revised as a result of additional information obtained during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date.\nMexico Acquisition\nOn December 1, 2022, we completed the Mexico Acquisition. The acquiree is a leading integrated producer of fiber-based sustainable packaging solutions that operates four paper mills, nine corrugated packaging plants and six high graphic plants throughout Mexico, producing sustainable packaging for a wide range of end markets in the region. This acquisition provides us with further geographic and end market diversification as well as positions us to continue to grow in the attractive Latin American market.\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nSee below for a summary of the purchase consideration transferred as defined under ASC 805 (in millions):\nPurchase\nConsideration\nCash consideration transferred for 67.7% interest\n$\n969.8\nFair value of the previously held interest\n403.7\nSettlement of preexisting relationships (net receivable\nfrom joint venture)\n40.2\nPurchase consideration transferred\n$\n1,413.7\nIn connection with the transaction, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 we recognized a $46.8 million non-cash, pre-tax loss (or $24.6 million after release of a related deferred tax liability) on our original 32.3% investment. The loss is reflected in the Equity in income of unconsolidated entities line item in our consolidated statements of operations and included the write-off of historical foreign currency translation adjustments previously recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet, as well as the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the carrying value of our prior ownership interest. The fair value of our previously held interest in the joint venture was estimated to be $403.7 million at the acquisition date based on the cash consideration exchanged for acquiring the 67.7% equity interest adjusted for the deemed payment of a control premium. This step-acquisition provided us with 100% control and we met the other requirements under ASC 805 for the transaction to be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. We have included the financial results of the acquired operations in our Corrugated Packaging segment. Post-acquisition, sales to the operations acquired in the Mexico Acquisition are eliminated from our Global Paper segment results.\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Mexico Acquisition by major class of assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date, as well as adjustments made during fiscal 2023 (referred to as measurement period adjustments) (in millions):\nAmounts Recognized as of the Acquisition Date\nMeasurement Period\nAdjustments (1) (2)\nAmounts Recognized as of Acquisition Date\n(as Adjusted)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n116.3\n$\n-\n$\n116.3\nCurrent assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents\n697.0\n(71.2\n)\n625.8\nProperty, plant and equipment\n1,380.3\n43.0\n1,423.3\nGoodwill\n231.2\n6.2\n237.4\nOther noncurrent assets\n101.4\n0.6\n102.0\nTotal assets acquired\n2,526.2\n(21.4\n)\n2,504.8\nCurrent portion of debt (3)\n13.2\n-\n13.2\nCurrent liabilities, excluding debt\n384.8\n(50.4\n)\n334.4\nLong-term debt due after one year (3)\n591.4\n36.2\n627.6\nPension liabilities, net of current portion\n35.2\n(3.1\n)\n32.1\nDeferred income taxes\n69.8\n(4.1\n)\n65.7\nOther noncurrent liabilities\n18.1\n-\n18.1\nTotal liabilities assumed\n1,112.5\n(21.4\n)\n1,091.1\nNet assets acquired\n$\n1,413.7\n$\n-\n$\n1,413.7\n(1)The measurement period adjustments recorded in fiscal 2023 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended September 30, 2023.\n(2)The measurement period adjustments were primarily due to refinements to the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities. The net impact of the measurement period adjustments resulted in a net increase in goodwill.\n(3)Includes $494.8 million of debt that we assumed and repaid in connection with the closing of the Mexico Acquisition. The remaining balance relates to current and long-term portions of finance leases.\nWe continue to analyze the estimated values of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed including, among other things, finalizing third-party valuations; therefore, the allocation of the purchase price remains preliminary and subject to revision.\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. The fair value assigned to goodwill is primarily attributable to buyer-specific synergies expected to arise after the acquisition (e.g., enhanced reach of the combined organization and other synergies), the assembled work force, and the establishment of deferred tax liabilities for the difference between book and tax basis of the assets and liabilities acquired. The goodwill is not amortizable for income tax purposes.\nTransaction costs related to the Mexico Acquisition are expensed as incurred and recorded within Restructuring and other costs, net. See Note 5. Restructuring and Other Costs, Net for additional information.\nNote 4. Held For Sale\nAssets held for sale at September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 were $91.5 million and $34.4 million, respectively. Assets held for sale for these periods were primarily related to closed facilities we are in the process of divesting.\nNote 5. Restructuring and Other Costs, Net\nSummary of Restructuring and Other Initiatives\nWe recorded pre-tax restructuring and other costs, net of $859.2 million, $383.0 million and $30.6 million for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of these costs, $604.6 million, $334.1 million and $13.4 million were non-cash for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts are not comparable since the timing and scope of the individual actions associated with each restructuring, acquisition, integration or divestiture can vary. We present our restructuring and other costs, net in more detail below.\nThe following table summarizes our Restructuring and other costs, net for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):\nRestructuring\n$\n803.9\n$\n373.5\n$\n27.6\nOther\n55.3\n9.5\n3.0\nRestructuring and other costs, net\n$\n859.2\n$\n383.0\n$\n30.6\nRestructuring\nOur restructuring charges are primarily associated with restructuring portions of our operations (i.e., partial or complete facility closures). A partial facility closure may consist of shutting down a machine and/or a workforce reduction. We have previously incurred reduction in workforce actions, facility closure activities, impairment costs and certain lease terminations from time to time.\nWe are committed to improving our return on invested capital as well as maximizing the performance of our assets. In fiscal 2023, we announced our plan to permanently cease operating our Tacoma, WA and North Charleston, SC containerboard mills. These mills ceased production in September 2023 and June 2023, respectively. The combination of high operating costs and the need for significant capital investment were the determining factors in the decision to cease operations at these mills. The Tacoma and North Charleston mills' annual production capacity was 510,000 tons and 550,000 tons, respectively, of which approximately three-fifths and two-thirds, respectively, was shipped to external customers of the Global Paper segment.\nIn fiscal 2022, we recorded various impairments and other charges associated with our decision to permanently cease operations at our Panama City, FL mill and to permanently close the corrugated medium manufacturing operations at our St. Paul, MN mill, as reflected in the table below in the Global Paper segment. These operations ceased production in June 2022 and October 2022, respectively. Both operations were expected to require significant capital investment to maintain and improve going forward, and the production of fluff pulp (at Panama City) was not a priority in our strategy to focus on higher value markets. The Panama City, FL mill had produced containerboard, primarily heavyweight kraft and fluff pulp, with a combined annual capacity of 645,000 tons of which\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\napproximately two-thirds was shipped to external customers. The corrugated medium manufacturing operations at St. Paul, MN had an annual capacity of 200,000 tons of which approximately two-fifths was shipped to external customers.\nBy closing these mills and the corrugated medium manufacturing operations at St. Paul, significant capital that would have been required to keep the mills competitive in the future is expected to be deployed to improve key assets. Charges recognized are reflected in the table below in the Global Paper segment. We expect to record future restructuring charges, primarily associated with carrying costs. We expect these costs to be partially offset in a future period by proceeds from the sale of these facilities.\nIn fiscal 2021, our restructuring charges included an impairment of assets and a gain on lease termination associated with our Richmond, VA regional office (in Corporate). Due to market factors in fiscal 2021, we decided to delay the previously announced shutdown of a bleached paperboard machine at our Evadale, TX mill, and in fiscal 2022, we decided to cancel our plans to shut down the machine and reversed certain employee and other accrued restructuring charges. The machine is capable of swinging between selected grades (e.g., linerboard, bleached paperboard and pulp), and we intend to utilize the machine to produce selected grades based on demand.\nWhile restructuring costs are not charged to our segments and, therefore, do not reduce each segment's Adjusted EBITDA, we highlight the segment to which the charges relate. Since we do not allocate restructuring costs to our segments, charges incurred in the Global Paper segment will represent all charges associated with our vertically integrated mills and recycling operations. These operations manufacture for the benefit of each reportable segment that ultimately sells the associated paper and packaging products to our external customers.\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following table presents a summary of restructuring charges related to active restructuring initiatives that we incurred during the last three fiscal years, the cumulative recorded amount since we started the initiatives and our estimates of the total charges we expect to incur (in millions).

We define \"Other restructuring costs\" as lease or other contract termination costs, facility carrying costs, equipment and inventory relocation costs, and other items, including impaired intangibles attributable to our restructuring actions.\nOther Costs\nOur other costs consist of acquisition, integration and divestiture costs. We incur costs when we acquire or divest businesses. Acquisition costs include costs associated with transactions, whether consummated or not, such as advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees, as well as potential litigation costs associated with those activities. We incur integration costs pre- and post-acquisition that reflect work performed to facilitate merger and acquisition integration, such as work associated with information systems and\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nother projects including spending to support future acquisitions, and primarily consist of professional services and labor. Divestiture costs consist primarily of similar professional fees. We consider acquisition, integration and divestiture costs to be corporate costs regardless of the segment or segments involved in the transaction.\nThe following table presents acquisition, integration and divestiture costs that we incurred during the last three fiscal years (in millions):\nAcquisition costs\n$\n26.1\n$\n4.4\n$\n0.5\nIntegration costs\n9.1\n0.7\n1.7\nDivestiture costs\n20.1\n4.4\n0.8\nOther total\n$\n55.3\n$\n9.5\n$\n3.0\nAcquisition costs for fiscal 2023 in the table above primarily include transaction costs related to the Mexico Acquisition and the Transaction.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the restructuring accrual, which is primarily composed of accrued severance and other employee costs, and a reconciliation of the restructuring accrual charges to the line item Restructuring and other costs, net on our consolidated statements of operations for the last three fiscal years (in millions):\nAccrual at beginning of fiscal year\n$\n25.2\n$\n13.4\n$\n17.2\nAdditional accruals\n70.5\n33.4\n17.4\nPayments\n(35.6\n)\n(15.9\n)\n(17.2\n)\nAdjustment to accruals\n(4.6\n)\n(5.6\n)\n(2.1\n)\nForeign currency rate changes and other\n-\n(0.1\n)\n(1.9\n)\nAccrual at end of fiscal year\n$\n55.5\n$\n25.2\n$\n13.4\nReconciliation of accruals and charges to restructuring and other costs, net (in millions):\nAdditional accruals and adjustments to accruals\n(see table above)\n$\n65.9\n$\n27.8\n$\n15.3\nPP&E and related costs\n598.2\n333.0\n11.2\nSeverance and other employee costs\n0.4\n0.5\n0.3\nAcquisition costs\n26.1\n4.4\n0.5\nIntegration costs\n9.1\n0.7\n1.7\nDivestiture costs\n20.1\n4.4\n0.8\nOther restructuring costs\n139.4\n12.2\n0.8\nTotal restructuring and other costs, net\n$\n859.2\n$\n383.0\n$\n30.6\nOther restructuring costs for fiscal 2023 in the previous table primarily include $70.3 million of lease or other contract termination costs, $33.3 million of facility carrying costs and $22.5 million of impaired intangibles attributable to our restructuring actions.\nNote 6. Retirement Plans\nWe have defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for certain U.S. and non-U.S. employees. We use a September 30 measurement date for our plans. Certain plans were frozen for salaried and non-union hourly employees at various times in the past, and nearly all of our remaining U.S. salaried and U.S. non-union hourly employees accruing benefits ceased accruing benefits as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we participate in several MEPPs that provide retirement benefits to certain union employees in accordance with various CBAs and have participated in other MEPPs in the past. We also have supplemental executive retirement plans and other non-qualified defined benefit pension plans that provide unfunded supplemental retirement benefits to\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\ncertain of our current and former executives. The supplemental executive retirement plans provide for incremental pension benefits in excess of those offered in the plan. The other postretirement benefit plans provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for certain salaried and hourly employees who meet specified age and service requirements as defined by the plans.\nThe benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on either compensation or a combination of years of service and negotiated benefit levels, depending upon the plan. We allocate our pension assets to several investment management firms across a variety of investment styles. Our defined benefit Investment Committee meets at least four times a year with our investment advisors to review each management firms performance and monitors its compliance with its stated goals, our investment policy and applicable regulatory requirements in the U.S., Canada, and other jurisdictions.\nInvestment returns vary. We believe that, by investing in a variety of asset classes and utilizing multiple investment management firms, we can create a portfolio that yields adequate returns with reduced volatility. Our qualified U.S. plans employ a liability matching strategy augmented with Treasury futures to materially hedge against interest rate risk. After consultation with our actuary and investment advisors, we adopted the target allocations in the table below for our pension plans in an effort to produce the desired performance. These target allocations are guidelines, not limitations, and occasionally plan fiduciaries will approve allocations above or below target ranges or modify the allocations.\nOur target asset allocations by asset category at September 30 were as follows:\nPension Plans\nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S.\nPlans\nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S.\nPlans\nEquity investments\n%\n%\n%\n%\nFixed income investments\n%\n%\n%\n%\nShort-term investments\n%\n%\n%\n%\nOther investments\n%\n%\n%\n%\nTotal\n%\n%\n%\n%\nOur asset allocations by asset category at September 30 were as follows:\nPension Plans\nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S.\nPlans\nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S.\nPlans\nEquity investments\n%\n%\n%\n%\nFixed income investments\n%\n%\n%\n%\nShort-term investments\n%\n%\n%\n%\nOther investments\n%\n%\n%\n%\nTotal\n%\n%\n%\n%\nWe manage our retirement plans in accordance with the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder as well as applicable legislation in Canada and other foreign countries. Our investment policy objectives include maximizing long-term returns at acceptable risk levels, diversifying among asset classes, as applicable, and among investment managers, as well as establishing certain risk parameters within asset classes. We have allocated our investments within the equity and fixed income asset classes to sub-asset classes designed to meet these objectives. In addition, our other investments support multi-strategy objectives.\nIn developing our weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets, we consulted with our investment advisors and evaluated criteria based on historical returns by asset class and long-term return expectations by asset class. We expect to contribute approximately $25 million to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans in fiscal\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n2024. However, it is possible that our assumptions or legislation may change, actual market performance may vary or we may decide to contribute a different amount. Therefore, the amount we contribute may vary materially. The expense for MEPPs for collective bargaining employees generally equals the contributions for these plans, excluding estimated accruals for withdrawal liabilities or adjustments to those accruals.\nThe weighted average assumptions used to measure the benefit plan obligations at September 30 were:\nPension Plans\nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S.\nPlans\nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S.\nPlans\nDiscount rate\n6.24\n%\n5.85\n%\n5.63\n%\n5.12\n%\nInterest crediting rate\n4.01\n%\nN/A\n3.08\n%\nN/A\nRate of compensation increase\n2.50\n%\n2.87\n%\n2.50\n%\n2.97\n%\nAt September 30, 2023, the discount rate for the U.S. pension plans was determined based on the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds, and the discount rate for the non-U.S. plans was determined based on a yield curve developed by our actuary. The theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds used to select the September 30, 2023 discount rate for the U.S. pension plans includes bonds generally rated Aa- or better with at least $100 million outstanding par value and bonds that are non-callable (unless the bonds possess a make whole feature). The theoretical portfolio of bonds has cash flows that generally match our expected benefit payments in future years.\nOur assumption regarding the future rate of compensation increases is reviewed periodically and is based on both our internal planning projections and recent history of actual compensation increases.\nWe typically review our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets periodically through an asset allocation study with either our actuary or investment advisor. In fiscal 2024, our expected rate of return used to determine net periodic benefit cost is 6.75% for our U.S. plans and 5.33% for our non-U.S. plans. Our expected rates of return in fiscal 2024 are based on an analysis of our long-term expected rate of return and our current asset allocation.\nIn December 2019, the USW ratified a new master agreement that applies to substantially all of our U.S. facilities represented by the USW. The agreement has a four-year term and covers a number of specific items, including wages, medical coverage and certain other benefit programs, substance abuse testing, and safety. Individual facilities will continue to have local agreements for subjects not covered by the master agreement and those agreements will continue to have staggered terms.

2033\n$\n24.2\n$\n18.2\nMultiemployer Plans\nWe participate in several MEPPs that provide retirement benefits to certain union employees in accordance with various CBAs. The risks of participating in MEPPs are different from the risks of participating in single-employer pension plans. These risks include (i) assets contributed to a MEPP by one employer are used to provide benefits to employees of all participating employers, (ii) if a participating employer withdraws from a MEPP, the unfunded obligations of the MEPP allocable to such withdrawing employer may be borne by the remaining participating employers, and (iii) if we withdraw from a MEPP, we may be required to pay that plan an amount based on our allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability, as well as a share of the MEPPs accumulated funding deficiency.\nContributions to MEPPs are established by the applicable CBAs; however, our required contributions may increase based on the funded status of a MEPP and legal requirements, such as those set forth in the Pension Act, which requires substantially underfunded MEPPs to implement a FIP or a RP to improve their funded status. Contributions to MEPPs are individually and in the aggregate not material.\nIn the normal course of business, we evaluate our potential exposure to MEPPs, including with respect to potential withdrawal liabilities. In fiscal 2018, we submitted formal notification to withdraw from certain MEPPs, including PIUMPF, and recorded estimated withdrawal liabilities for each. The PIUMPF estimated withdrawal liability assumed both a payment for withdrawal liability and for our proportionate share of PIUMPFs accumulated funding deficiency. The estimated withdrawal liability excludes the potential impact of a future mass withdrawal of other employers from PIUMPF, which was not considered probable or reasonably estimable and was discounted at a credit adjusted risk-free rate.\nIn September 2019, we received a demand from PIUMPF asserting that we owe $170.3 million on an undiscounted basis (approximately $0.7 million per month for the next 20 years) with respect to our withdrawal liability. The initial demand did not address any assertion of liability for PIUMPFs accumulated funding deficiency. We began making monthly payments for the withdrawal liability in fiscal 2020. In February 2020, we received a demand letter from PIUMPF asserting that we owe $51.2 million for our pro-rata share of PIUMPFs accumulated funding deficiency, including interest. We dispute the PIUMPF accumulated funding deficiency demands. Similarly, in April 2020, we received an updated demand letter related to a subsidiary of ours asserting that we owe $1.3 million of additional accumulated funding deficiency, including interest. We assessed our liability following receipt of the demand letters, the impact of which was not significant. The subsidiary for which we received the updated demand letter was sold in September 2023. We also have liabilities associated with other MEPPs from which we, or legacy companies, have withdrawn in the past.\nIn July 2021, PIUMPF filed suit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia claiming the right to recover our pro rata share of the pension funds accumulated funding deficiency, along with interest, liquidated damages and attorneys fees. We believe we are adequately reserved for this matter.\nAt September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, we had recorded withdrawal liabilities of $203.2 million and $214.7 million, respectively including liabilities associated with PIUMPFs accumulated funding deficiency demands.\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe liability reduction in fiscal 2023 was primarily the result of non-PIUMPF arbitrations, the impact of which is reflected in Multiemployer pension withdrawal (income) expense on our consolidated statements of operations.\nWith respect to certain other MEPPs, in the event we withdraw from one or more of the MEPPs in the future, it is reasonably possible that we may incur withdrawal liabilities in connection with such withdrawals. Our estimate of any such withdrawal liabilities, both individually and in the aggregate, are not material for the remaining plans in which we participate.\nApproximately 54% of our hourly employees in the U.S. and Canada are covered by CBAs, of which approximately 25% of those employees covered under CBAs are operating under local agreements that expire within one year and approximately 11% of those employees are governed under expired local contracts.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe have 401(k) and other defined contribution plans that cover certain of our U.S., Canadian and other non-U.S. salaried union and nonunion hourly employees, generally subject to an initial waiting period. The 401(k) and other defined contribution plans permit participants to make contributions by salary reduction pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the taxing authority in the jurisdiction in which they operate. Due primarily to acquisitions, CBAs, and other non-U.S. defined contribution programs, we have plans with varied terms. At September 30, 2023, our contributions may be up to 7.5% for U.S. salaried and non-union hourly employees, consisting of a match of up to 5% and an automatic employer contribution of 2.5%. Certain other employees who receive accruals under a defined benefit pension plan, as well as certain employees covered by CBAs and non-U.S. defined contribution programs generally receive up to a 3.0% to 4.0% contribution to their 401(k) plan or defined contribution plan. During fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded expense of $163.7 million, $169.5 million and $164.7 million, respectively, related to employer contributions to the 401(k) plans and other defined contribution plans, including the automatic employer contribution. We funded our matching contributions to the WestRock Company 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan in Common Stock effective July 1, 2020 and ending September 30, 2021 (final period funded in October 2021).\nSupplemental Retirement Plans\nWe have Supplemental Plans that are nonqualified deferred compensation plans. We intend to provide participants with an opportunity to supplement their retirement income through deferral of current compensation. Amounts deferred and payable under the Supplemental Plans are our unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness outstanding. Participants accounts are credited with investment gains and losses under the Supplemental Plans in accordance with the participants investment election or elections (or default election or elections) as in effect from time to time. At September 30, 2023, the Supplemental Plans had assets totaling $152.4 million that are recorded at market value, and liabilities of $146.4 million. The investment alternatives available under the Supplemental Plans are generally similar to investment alternatives available under 401(k) plans. The amount of expense we recorded for the current fiscal year and the preceding two fiscal years was not significant.\nNote 7.

These loss carryforwards expire in fiscal 2031.\nAt September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had gross state and local net operating losses, of approximately $861 million and $969 million, respectively. These loss carryforwards generally expire between fiscal 2024 and 2042. The tax effected values of these net operating losses are $36.6 million and $43.6 million at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, exclusive of valuation allowances of $17.8 million and $17.7 million at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAt September 30, 2023 and 2022, gross net operating losses for foreign reporting purposes of approximately $760.6 million and $667.2 million, respectively, were available for carryforward. A majority of these loss carryforwards generally expire between fiscal 2024 and 2042, while a portion have an indefinite carryforward.

These state tax credit carryforwards generally expire within 5 to 10 years; however, certain state credits can be carried forward indefinitely. Valuation allowances of $81.0 million and $81.1 million at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, have been provided on these assets. These valuation allowances have been recorded due to uncertainty regarding our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction.\nThe following table represents a summary of the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):\nBalance at beginning of fiscal year\n$\n248.8\n$\n277.5\n$\n257.5\nIncreases\n29.0\n12.3\n22.2\nReductions\n(5.9\n)\n(41.0\n)\n(2.2\n)\nBalance at end of fiscal year\n$\n271.9\n$\n248.8\n$\n277.5\nConsistent with prior years, we consider a portion of our earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries as subject to repatriation and we provide for taxes accordingly. However, we consider the unremitted earnings and all other outside basis differences from all other foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. Accordingly, we have not provided for any taxes that would be due.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we estimate our outside basis difference in foreign subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested to be approximately $1.3 billion. The components of the outside basis difference are comprised of acquisition accounting adjustments, undistributed earnings, and equity components. In the event of a distribution in the form of dividends or dispositions of the subsidiaries, we may be subject to incremental U.S. income taxes, subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits, and withholding taxes or income taxes payable to the foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2023, the determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis differences is not practicable.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\nBalance at beginning of fiscal year\n$\n195.5\n$\n199.5\n$\n206.7\nAdditions for tax positions taken in current year\n4.5\n1.8\n2.7\nAdditions for tax positions taken in prior fiscal years\n14.2\n27.6\n10.8\nReclassification to unrecognized tax benefit (1)\n221.9\n-\n-\nReductions for tax positions taken in prior fiscal years\n(1.3\n)\n-\n-\nReductions due to settlement\n(2.5\n)\n(0.8\n)\n-\nAdditions (reductions) for currency translation adjustments\n2.4\n(1.1\n)\n1.5\nReductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of\nlimitations\n(29.6\n)\n(31.5\n)\n(22.2\n)\nBalance at end of fiscal year\n$\n405.1\n$\n195.5\n$\n199.5\n(1)During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we undertook certain internal transactions to bring the legal entity that acquired Grupo Gondi into the affiliated group of companies electing to file a U.S. consolidated federal income tax return. As a result of those transactions and in accordance with the requirements of ASC 740, we recorded an addition for gross unrecognized tax benefits of $221.9 million related to the deferred gain on Timber Notes (as hereinafter defined). See Note 17. Special Purpose Entities for additional information.\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $405.1 million and $195.5 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. Of these balances, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, if we were to prevail on all unrecognized tax benefits recorded, approximately $400.6 million and $188.1 million, respectively, would benefit the effective tax rate. We regularly evaluate, assess and adjust the related liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances, which could cause the effective tax rate to fluctuate from period to period. Resolution of the uncertain tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows or materially benefit our results of operations in future periods depending upon their ultimate resolution. See Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies - Brazil Tax Liability for additional information.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had liabilities of $100.2 million and $85.0 million, respectively, related to estimated interest and penalties for unrecognized tax benefits. Our results of operations for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 include expense of $8.0 million, $3.8 million and $4.4 million, respectively, net of indirect benefits, related to estimated interest and penalties with respect to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. As of September 30, 2023, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by up to $0.5 million in the next 12 months due to expiration of various statutes of limitations and settlement of issues.\nWe file federal, state and local income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to fiscal 2018 and state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to fiscal 2012. We are no longer subject to non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to fiscal 2009, except for Brazil for which we are not subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2006. While we believe our tax positions are appropriate, they are subject to audit or other modifications, and any modifications could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nNote 8. Segment Information\nWe report our financial results of operations in the following four reportable segments:\nCorrugated Packaging, which substantially consists of our integrated corrugated converting operations and generates its revenues primarily from the sale of corrugated containers and other corrugated products, including the operations acquired in the Mexico Acquisition;\nConsumer Packaging, which consists of our integrated consumer converting operations and generates its revenues primarily from the sale of consumer packaging products such as folding cartons, interior partitions (before divestiture in September 2023) and other consumer products;\nGlobal Paper, which consists of our commercial paper operations and generates its revenues primarily from the sale of containerboard and paperboard to external customers; and\nDistribution, which consists of our distribution and display assembly operations and generates its revenues primarily from the distribution of packaging products and assembly of display products.\nWe determined our operating segments based on the products and services we offer. Our operating segments are consistent with our internal management structure, and we do not aggregate operating segments. We report the benefit of vertical integration with our mills in each reportable segment that ultimately sells the associated paper and packaging products to our external customers. We account for intersegment sales at prices that approximate market prices.\nWe have included the operations acquired in the Mexico Acquisition in our Corrugated Packaging segment, which is consistent with our internal operational structure and how our CODM allocates resources and assesses financial performance. See Note 3. Acquisitions for additional information. As part of this assessment, we also moved certain existing consumer converting operations in Latin America into our Corrugated Packaging segment in line with how we are managing the business effective January 1, 2023. We did not recast prior year results related to these operations as they were not material.\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAdjusted EBITDA is our measure of segment profitability in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting because it is used by our CODM to make decisions regarding allocation of resources and to assess segment performance. Certain items are not allocated to our operating segments and, thus, the information that our CODM uses to make operating decisions and assess performance does not reflect such amounts. Management believes excluding these items is useful in the evaluation of operating performance from period to period because these items are not representative of our ongoing operations or are items our CODM does not consider part of our reportable segments.\nSome of our operations are in locations such as Canada, Latin America, EMEA and Asia Pacific.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, due to the sustained decrease in our market capitalization and the further deterioration of macroeconomic conditions, including the impact of soft demand, pricing pressure and elevated inflation, which negatively affected our long-term forecasts in certain segments, we concluded that impairment indicators existed. As a result, we completed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test in conjunction with our normal quarterly reporting process. Consistent with past practice, the estimated fair value of our reporting units was determined using a combination of the Income Approach and Market Approach. These fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors.\nIn fiscal 2023, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $1,893.0 million ($1,821.8 million after-tax) associated with our interim goodwill impairment analysis completed in the second quarter; $1,378.7 million in the Global Paper reportable segment and $514.3 million in the Corrugated Packaging reportable segment. Goodwill associated with the Global Paper reporting unit was written off in its entirety as of March 31, 2023.\nAnnual Goodwill Impairment Analysis\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing. All reporting units that have goodwill were noted to have a fair value that exceeded their carrying values. See Note 1. Description\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nof Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Goodwill for a discussion of our fiscal 2023 annual impairment test.\nNote 9.

In fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, we reduced inventory quantities in some of our LIFO pools. These reductions result in liquidations of LIFO inventory quantities generally carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years as compared with the cost of the purchases in the respective fiscal years, the effect of which typically decreases cost of goods sold. Alternatively, higher costs prevailing in prior years increase costs of goods sold. The impact of the liquidations in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was not significant.\nIn fiscal 2023, we experienced lower inventory costs primarily due to deflation in the last half of the year, the effect of which decreased cost of goods sold and our LIFO reserve by $104.4 million.\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNote 11.

Fair Value\nAssets and Liabilities Measured or Disclosed at Fair Value\nWe estimate fair values in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. We have not changed the valuation techniques for measuring the fair value of any financial assets or liabilities during the fiscal year. We disclose the fair value of our long-term debt in Note 14. Debt and the fair value of our pension and postretirement assets and liabilities in Note 6. Retirement Plans. We disclose the fair value of our derivative instruments in Note 16. Derivatives and our restricted assets and non-recourse liabilities held by SPEs in Note 17. Special Purpose Entities. See Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Fair Value Measurements for additional information.\nFiscal 2021 reflected a charge of $22.5 million associated with not exercising an option to purchase an additional equity interest in Grupo Gondi that was recorded in Other (expense) income, net.\nFinancial Instruments Not Recognized at Fair Value\nFinancial instruments not recognized at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, certain other current assets, short-term debt, accounts payable, certain other current liabilities and long-term debt. With the exception of long-term debt, the carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair values due to their short maturities.\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\nAs discussed in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. In fiscal 2023, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $1,893.0 million associated with our interim goodwill impairment analysis completed in the second quarter. See Note 8. Segment Information for additional information. See Note 5. Restructuring and Other Costs, Net for impairments associated with restructuring activities labeled as PP&E and related costs including the impairment of our Tacoma, WA and North Charleston, SC containerboard mills in fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2022, we recorded impairments associated with the closure of our Panama City, FL mill and the permanent closure of the corrugated medium manufacturing operations at our St. Paul, MN mill. Fair value of the remaining land, building and improvements of these facilities was determined based on third-party appraisals. During fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, we did not have any significant non-goodwill or non-restructuring nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition other than the $26.0 million pre-tax non-cash impairment of certain mineral rights in fiscal 2022 that was driven by a lack of new leasing or development activity on our properties for an extended period of time, including pipeline delays. With the impairment, we had no value assigned to our remaining mineral rights.\nAccounts Receivable Monetization Agreements\nOn September 11, 2023, we terminated our existing $700.0 million accounts receivable monetization facility to sell to a third-party financial institution all of the short-term receivables generated from certain customer trade accounts. On the same date, we entered into a new replacement $700.0 million facility (the Monetization Agreement) with Co\u00f6peratieve Rabobank U.A., New York Branch, as purchaser, (Rabo) on substantially the same terms as the former agreement. The Monetization Agreement provides for, among other things, (i) an extension of the scheduled amortization termination date until September 13, 2024, and (ii) the ability to effectuate the Transaction without any additional consent from Rabo or the triggering of a notification event under the Monetization Agreement. The terms of the Monetization Agreement limit the balance of receivables sold to the amount available to fund such receivables sold, thereby eliminating the receivable for proceeds from the financial institution at any transfer date. Transfers under the Monetization Agreement meet the requirements to be accounted for as sales in accordance with guidance in ASC 860. We will pay a monthly yield on investment to Rabo at a rate equal to adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin on the outstanding amount of Rabos investment.\nWe also have a similar $110.0 million facility that was amended on December 2, 2021 to address the transition from LIBOR to SOFR. The facility was again amended on December 2, 2022 to extend the term through December\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n4, 2023 and to include certain fee and other general revisions. The facility purchase limit was unchanged and the facility remains committed.\nThe customers from these facilities are not included in the Receivables Securitization Facility that is discussed in Note 14. Debt.\nThe following table represents a summary of these accounts receivable monetization agreements for fiscal 2023 and 2022 (in millions):\nReceivable from financial institutions at beginning of fiscal year\n$\n-\n$\n-\nReceivables sold to the financial institutions and derecognized\n(2,795.3\n)\n(2,954.8\n)\nReceivables collected by financial institutions\n2,827.8\n2,896.0\nCash (payments to) proceeds from financial institutions\n(32.5\n)\n58.8\nReceivable from financial institutions at September 30,\n$\n-\n$\n-\nReceivables sold under these accounts receivable monetization agreements as of the respective balance sheet dates were approximately $692.2 million and $724.7 million as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively.\nCash proceeds related to the receivables sold are included in Net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flow in the accounts receivable line item. While the expense recorded in connection with the sale of receivables may vary based on current rates and levels of receivables sold, the expense recorded in connection with the sale of receivables was $48.3 million, $20.4 million and $11.1 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is recorded in Other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. Although the sales are made without recourse, we maintain continuing involvement with the sold receivables as we provide collections services related to the transferred assets. The associated servicing liability is not material given the high credit quality of the customers underlying the receivables and the anticipated short collection period.\nNote 14. Debt\nOur outstanding indebtedness consists primarily of public bonds and borrowings under credit facilities. The public bonds issued by WRKCo and MWV are guaranteed by WestRock and certain WestRock subsidiaries. The public bonds are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations that rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured, unsubordinated obligations. The bonds are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt and to the obligations of our non-debtor/guarantor subsidiaries. The industrial development bonds associated with the finance lease obligations of MWV are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. At September 30, 2023, all of our debt was unsecured with the exception of our Receivables Securitization Facility (as defined below) and finance lease obligations.\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following were individual components of debt (in millions, except percentages):\nSeptember 30, 2023\nSeptember 30, 2022\nCarrying\nValue\nWeighted Avg\nInterest Rate\nCarrying\nValue\nWeighted Avg\nInterest Rate\nPublic bonds due fiscal 2024 to 2028\n$\n2,938.6\n4.1\n%\n$\n3,433.4\n4.0\n%\nPublic bonds due fiscal 2029 to 2033\n2,739.5\n4.5\n%\n2,753.3\n4.5\n%\nPublic bonds due fiscal 2037 to 2047\n177.3\n6.2\n%\n177.8\n6.2\n%\nRevolving credit and swing facilities\n32.0\n6.7\n%\n286.3\n1.9\n%\nTerm loan facilities\n1,347.4\n5.0\n%\n598.2\n3.1\n%\nReceivables securitization\n425.0\n6.4\n%\n-\nN/A\nCommercial paper\n283.9\n5.6\n%\n-\nN/A\nInternational and other debt\n61.9\n9.6\n%\n127.6\n12.8\n%\nFinance lease obligations\n472.6\n5.1\n%\n287.5\n4.2\n%\nVendor financing and commercial card\nprograms\n105.7\nN/A\n123.1\nN/A\nTotal debt\n8,583.9\n4.6\n%\n7,787.2\n4.2\n%\nLess: current portion of debt\n533.0\n212.2\nLong-term debt due after one year\n$\n8,050.9\n$\n7,575.0\nA portion of the debt classified as long-term may be paid down earlier than scheduled at our discretion without penalty. Our credit facilities contain certain restrictive covenants, including a covenant to satisfy a debt to capitalization ratio. We test and report our compliance with these covenants as required by these facilities and were in compliance with them at September 30, 2023. The carrying value of our debt includes the fair value step-up of debt acquired in mergers and acquisitions, and the weighted average interest rate includes the fair value step up. At September 30, 2023, excluding the step-up, the weighted average interest rate on total debt was 5.2%. At September 30, 2023, the unamortized fair market value step-up was $157.0 million, which will be amortized over a weighted average remaining life of 9.1 years. At September 30, 2023, we had $77.6 million of outstanding letters of credit not drawn upon. At September 30, 2023, we had approximately $3.4 billion of available liquidity under long-term committed credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents. This liquidity may be used to provide for ongoing working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes including acquisitions and dividends.\nThe estimated fair value of our debt was approximately $8.1 billion and $7.3 billion as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. The fair value of our long-term debt is categorized as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and is primarily either based on quoted prices for those or similar instruments, or approximate their carrying amount, as the variable interest rates reprice frequently at observable current market rates.\nDuring fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, amortization of debt issuance costs charged to interest expense were $7.1 million, $7.3 million and $8.3 million, respectively.\nPublic Bonds\nOn September 26, 2023, following completion of consent solicitations, we entered into supplemental indentures governing our outstanding: (i) $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.750% senior notes due March 2025; (ii) $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.650% senior notes due March 2026; (iii) $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes due September 2027; (iv) $600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.000% senior notes due March 2028 and (v) $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.900% senior notes due March 2029 to, among other things, amend the definition of Change of Control to add an exception for the proposed Transaction.\nOn September 22, 2023, we discharged $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.00% senior notes due September 2024 using cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our commercial paper program and recorded a $10.5 million gain on extinguishment of debt.\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nOn March 22, 2022, we redeemed $350 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.00% senior notes due March 2023 primarily using borrowings under our Receivables Securitization Facility (as hereinafter defined) and recorded an $8.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt.\nOn September 10, 2021, we redeemed $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.90% senior notes due March 2022 using cash and cash equivalents and recorded a $8.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt.\nAt September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the face value of our public bond obligations outstanding was $5.7 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively.\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn July 7, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the \"Revolving Credit Agreement\") that included a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of $2.3 billion, consisting of a $1.8 billion U.S. revolving facility and a $500 million multicurrency revolving facility (collectively, the Revolving Credit Facility) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and multicurrency agent. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by WestRock Company and certain of its subsidiaries as set forth in the Revolving Credit Agreement. We amended the Revolving Credit Agreement on September 27, 2023, to provide that the proposed Transaction would not constitute a Change in Control thereunder. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had no amounts outstanding under the facility, respectively.\nLoans under the Revolving Credit Facility may be drawn in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Euro and Pounds Sterling. At our option, loans under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at (a) in the case of loans denominated in U.S. dollars, either Term SOFR or an alternate base rate, (b) in the case of loans denominated in Canadian dollars, one of CDOR, the U.S. Base Rate or the Canadian Prime Rate, (c) in the case of loans denominated in Euro, EURIBOR and (d) in the case of loans denominated in Pounds Sterling, SONIA, in each case plus an applicable interest rate margin that will fluctuate between 0.875% per annum and 1.500% per annum (for Term SOFR loans, CDOR loans, EURIBOR loans and SONIA loans) or between 0.000% per annum and 0.500% per annum (for alternate base rate loans, U.S. Base Rate loans and Canadian Prime Rate loans), based upon the Companys corporate credit ratings or the Leverage Ratio (as each of these terms is defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) whichever yields a lower applicable interest rate margin at such time. Term SOFR loans will be subject to a credit spread adjustment equal to 0.100% per annum. In addition, unused revolving commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility will accrue a commitment fee that will fluctuate between 0.080% per annum and 0.225% per annum, based upon the Companys corporate credit ratings or the Leverage Ratio (whichever yields a lower applicable commitment fee rate) at such time.\nEuropean Revolving Credit Facilities\nOn July 7, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the \"European Revolving Credit Agreement\") with Rabo, as administrative agent. The European Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a three-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of \u20ac700.0 million and includes an incremental \u20ac100.0 million accordion feature (the European Revolving Credit Facility). The European Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by WestRock Company and certain of its subsidiaries as set forth in the European Revolving Credit Agreement. We amended the European Revolving Credit Agreement on September 27, 2023, to provide that the proposed Transaction would not constitute a Change in Control thereunder. At September 30, 2023 we had no amounts outstanding under the facility. At September 30, 2022, we had borrowed $265.0 million under the facility.\nLoans under the European Revolving Credit Facility may be drawn in U.S. dollars, Euro and Pounds Sterling. At our option, loans under the European Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at (a) in the case of loans denominated in U.S. dollars, either Term SOFR or an alternate base rate, (b) in the case of loans denominated in Euro, EURIBOR and (c) in the case of loans denominated in Pounds Sterling, SONIA, in each case plus an applicable interest rate margin that will fluctuate between 0.875% per annum and 1.625% per annum (for Term SOFR loans, EURIBOR loans and SONIA loans) or between 0.000% per annum and 0.625% per annum (for alternate base rate loans), based upon the Companys corporate credit ratings at such time. Term SOFR loans will\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nbe subject to a credit spread adjustment equal to 0.100% per annum. In addition, unused revolving commitments under the European Revolving Credit Facility will accrue a commitment fee that will fluctuate between 0.100% per annum and 0.275% per annum, based upon the Companys corporate credit ratings at such time. Loans under the European Revolving Credit Facility may be prepaid at any time without premium.\nTerm Loan Facilities\nFarm Loan Credit Facilities\nOn July 7, 2022, we amended and restated the prior credit agreement (the Farm Credit Facility Agreement) with CoBank, ACB, as administrative agent. The Farm Credit Facility Agreement provides for a seven-year senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $600 million (the Farm Credit Facility). At any time, we have the ability to request an increase in the principal amount by up to $400 million by written notice. The Farm Credit Facility is guaranteed by WestRock Company and certain of its subsidiaries as set forth in the Farm Credit Facility Agreement. We amended the Farm Credit Facility Agreement on September 27, 2023, to provide that the proposed Transaction would not constitute a Change in Control thereunder. The carrying value of this facility at September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $598.4 million and $598.2 million, respectively.\nAt our option, loans issued under the Farm Credit Facility will bear interest at either Term SOFR or an alternate base rate, in each case plus an applicable interest rate margin that will fluctuate between 1.650% per annum and 2.275% per annum (for Term SOFR loans) or between 0.650% per annum and 1.275% per annum (for alternate base rate loans), based upon the Companys corporate credit ratings or the Leverage Ratio (as each of these terms is defined in the Farm Credit Facility Agreement) whichever yields a lower applicable interest rate margin at such time. In addition, Term SOFR loans will be subject to a credit spread adjustment equal to 0.100% per annum.\nDelayed Draw Term Facility\nOn August 18, 2022, we amended the Revolving Credit Agreement (the \"Amended Credit Agreement\") to add a three-year unsecured delayed draw term loan facility with an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0 billion (the \"Delayed Draw Term Facility\") that could be borrowed in a single draw through May 31, 2023. On November 28, 2022, in connection with the Mexico Acquisition, we drew upon the facility in full. The Delayed Draw Term Facility is guaranteed by WestRock Company and certain of its subsidiaries as set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement. We have the option to extend the maturity date by one year with full lender consent. The one-year maturity extension would cost a fee of 20 basis points. We amended the Amended Credit Agreement on September 27, 2023, to provide that the proposed Transaction would not constitute a Change in Control thereunder. At September 30, 2023, the carrying value of this facility was $749.0 million.\nAt our option, a loan under the Delayed Draw Term Facility will bear interest at either Term SOFR or an alternate base rate, in each case plus an applicable interest rate margin that will fluctuate between 0.875% per annum and 1.500% per annum for a Term SOFR loan or between 0.000% per annum and 0.500% per annum for an alternate base rate loan based upon the Companys corporate credit ratings or the Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), whichever yields a lower applicable interest rate margin, at such time. A Term SOFR loan will be subject to a credit spread adjustment equal to 0.100% per annum. Any loan under the Delayed Draw Term Facility may be prepaid at any time without premium, and it may not be reborrowed.\nReceivables Securitization Facility\nOn February 28, 2023, we amended our existing $700.0 million receivables securitization agreement (the Receivables Securitization Facility), primarily to extend the maturity to February 27, 2026, and to complete the transition from LIBOR to Term SOFR. Term SOFR loans are subject to a credit spread adjustment equal to 0.10% per annum. The commitment fee was 0.25% and 0.35% as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. At September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, maximum available borrowings, excluding amounts outstanding under the Receivables Securitization Facility, were $700.0 million and $700.0 million, respectively. The carrying amount of accounts receivable collateralizing the maximum available borrowings at September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 were approximately $1,177.6 million and $1,390.5 million, respectively. We have continuing involvement with the underlying receivables as we provide credit and collections services pursuant to\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nthe Receivables Securitization Facility. We amended the Receivables Securitization Facility on September 29, 2023, to provide that the proposed Transaction would not be deemed to constitute a Change in Control thereunder. At September 30, 2023 we had borrowed $425.0 million under this facility. At September 30, 2022 there were no amounts outstanding under this facility.\nBorrowing availability under this facility is based on the eligible underlying accounts receivable and compliance with certain covenants. The agreement governing the Receivables Securitization Facility contains restrictions, including, among others, on the creation of certain liens on the underlying collateral. We test and report our compliance with these covenants monthly; we were in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2023. The Receivables Securitization Facility includes certain restrictions on receivables eligibility under the facility and allows for the exclusion of eligible receivables of specific obligors each calendar year subject to the following restrictions: (i) the aggregate of excluded receivables may not exceed 7.5% of eligible receivables under the Receivables Securitization Facility and (ii) the excluded receivables of each obligor may not exceed 2.5% of the aggregate outstanding balance.\nCommercial Paper Program\nOn December 7, 2018, we established an unsecured commercial paper program with WRKCo as the issuer. Under the program, we may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount at any time not to exceed $1.0 billion with up to 397-day maturities. The program has no expiration date and can be terminated by either the agent or us with not less than 30 days notice. Our Revolving Credit Facility is (and, prior to July 7, 2022, the prior revolving credit facility was) intended to backstop the commercial paper program. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. At September 30, 2023 there was $283.9 million outstanding. At September 30, 2022, there were no amounts outstanding.\nInternational and Other Debt\nBrazil Export Credit Note\nOn January 18, 2021, we entered into a credit agreement to provide for R$500.0 million of a senior unsecured term loan of WestRock Celulose, Papel E Embalagens Ltda. (a subsidiary of the Company), as borrower, and the Company, as guarantor. The agreement provides for the outstanding amount of the principal to be repaid in equal, semiannual installments beginning on January 19, 2023 until the facility matures on January 19, 2026. The proceeds borrowed are to be used to support the production of goods or acquisition of inputs that are essential or ancillary to export activities. Loans issued under the facility will bear interest at a floating rate based on Brazils Certificate of Interbank Deposit rate plus a spread of 2.50%. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, there was R$147.1 million ($29.4 million) outstanding and R$500.0 million ($92.7 million) outstanding, respectively.\nBrazil Delayed Draw Credit Facilities\nOn April 10, 2019, we entered into a credit agreement to provide for R$750.0 million of senior unsecured term loans with an incremental R$250.0 million accordion feature to be repaid in equal, semiannual installments beginning on April 10, 2021 until maturity on April 10, 2024 (the Brazil Delayed Draw Credit Facilities). The proceeds of the Brazil Delayed Draw Credit Facilities were used to support the production of goods or acquisition of inputs essential or ancillary to export activities. On September 16, 2022, we repaid the facility in full, which resulted in termination of the facility. The Brazil Delayed Draw Credit Facilities were senior unsecured obligations of Rigesa Celulose, Papel E Embalagens Ltda. (a subsidiary of the Company), as borrower, and the Company, as guarantor. Loans issued under the Brazil Delayed Draw Credit Facilities bore interest at a floating rate based on Brazils Certificate of Interbank Deposit rate plus a spread of 1.50%.\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAggregate Maturities of Debt\nAs of September 30, 2023, the aggregate maturities of debt, excluding finance lease obligations, for the succeeding five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows (in millions):\nFiscal 2024\n$\n469.7\nFiscal 2025\n1,353.3\nFiscal 2026\n1,178.1\nFiscal 2027\n506.0\nFiscal 2028\n1,100.9\nThereafter\n3,379.7\nFair value of debt step-up, deferred financing costs and unamortized\nbond discounts\n123.6\nTotal\n$\n8,111.3\nSee Note 15.

Derivatives\nWe are exposed to risks from changes in, among other things, commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk. To manage these risks, from time to time and to varying degrees, we may enter into a\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nvariety of financial derivative transactions and certain physical commodity transactions that are determined to be derivatives.\nWe have designated certain natural gas commodity contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. Therefore, the entire change in fair value of the financial derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction, and in the same period or periods during which the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Fair value measurements for our natural gas commodity derivatives are classified under level 2 because such measurements are estimated based on observable inputs such as commodity future prices. Approximately three-fourths of our natural gas purchases for our U.S. and Canadian mill operations are tied to NYMEX. Our natural gas hedging positions are entered in layers over multiple months and up to 12 months in advance to achieve a targeted hedging volume of up to 80% of our anticipated NYMEX-based natural gas purchases. However, we may modify our strategy based on, among other things, our assessment of market conditions.\nFor financial derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges, the entire change in fair value of the financial instrument is reported immediately in current period earnings.\nThe following table sets forth the outstanding notional amounts related to our derivative instruments (in millions):\nSeptember 30,\nMetric\nDesignated cash flow hedges:\nNatural gas commodity contracts\nMMBtu\n22.0\n18.3\nUndesignated derivatives:\nForeign currency contracts (1)\nMexican pesos\n-\n8,000.0\n(1)At September 30, 2022, the outstanding foreign currency exchange contract was related to the purchase of 8.0 billion Mexican pesos ($389.9 million) for refinancing the external debt acquired in the Mexico Acquisition on December 1, 2022.\nThe following table sets forth the location and fair values of our derivative instruments (in millions):\nSeptember 30,\nConsolidated Balance\nSheet Caption\nDesignated cash flow hedges:\nNatural gas commodity contracts\nOther current liabilities (1)\n$\n6.3\n$\n12.0\nUndesignated derivatives:\nForeign currency contracts\nOther current assets\n$\n-\n$\n3.4\n(1)At September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, liability positions by counterparty were partially offset by $0.2 million and $2.3 million, respectively, of asset positions where we had an enforceable right of netting.\nThe following table sets forth gains (losses) recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax for cash flow hedges (in millions):\nYears Ended September 30,\nNatural gas commodity contracts\n$\n4.2\n$\n(8.9\n)\n$\n-\nInterest rate swap contracts\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n5.4\nThe following table sets forth amounts of gains (losses) recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for cash flow hedges reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss (in millions):\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nYears Ended September 30,\nConsolidated Statement\nof Operations Caption\nNatural gas commodity contracts\nCost of goods sold\n$\n(72.6\n)\n$\n(1.8\n)\n$\n-\nInterest rate swap contracts\nInterest expense, net\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n(7.4\n)\nThe following table sets forth amounts of gains (losses) recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for derivatives not designated as hedges (in millions):\nYears Ended September 30,\nConsolidated Statement\nof Operations Caption\nForeign currency contracts\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n19.7\n$\n-\n$\n-\nNote 17. Special Purpose Entities\nPursuant to a sale of certain large-tract forestlands in 2007, a special purpose entity MeadWestvaco Timber Notes Holding, LLC (MWV TN) received, and WestRock assumed upon the strategic combination of Rock-Tenn Company and MeadWestvaco Corporations respective businesses (the Combination), an installment note receivable in the amount of $398.0 million (Timber Note I). Timber Note I does not require any principal payments until its maturity in October 2027 and bore interest at a rate approximating LIBOR prior to its amendment and transition to Term SOFR in June 2023. In addition, Timber Note I is supported by a bank-issued irrevocable letter of credit obtained by the buyer of the forestlands. Timber Note I is not subject to prepayment in whole or in part prior to maturity. The banks credit rating as of October 2023 was investment grade.\nUsing Timber Note I as collateral, MWV TN received $338.3 million in proceeds under a secured financing agreement with a bank. Under the terms of the agreement, the liability from this transaction is non-recourse to the Company and is payable from Timber Note I proceeds upon its maturity in October 2027. As a result, Timber Note I is not available to satisfy any obligations of WestRock. MWV TN can elect to prepay at any time the liability in whole or in part, however, given that Timber Note I is not prepayable, MWV TN expects to repay the liability at maturity from Timber Note I proceeds. Timber Note I and the secured financing liability were fair valued on the opening balance sheet in connection with the Combination.\nPursuant to the sale of MeadWestvaco Corporations remaining U.S. forestlands, which occurred on December 6, 2013, another special purpose entity MeadWestvaco Timber Notes Holding Company II, LLC (MWV TN II) received, and WestRock assumed upon the Combination, an installment note receivable in the amount of $860.0 million (Timber Note II and together with Timber Note I, the Timber Notes). Timber Note II does not require any principal payments until its maturity in December 2023 and bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.207%. As of September 30, 2023, no event had occurred that would allow for the prepayment of Timber Note II. Timber Note II became prepayable at the borrowers discretion on October 1, 2023. We expect it to be repaid at or close to maturity. We monitor the credit quality of the borrower and receive quarterly compliance certificates. The borrowers credit rating as of October 2023 was investment grade.\nUsing Timber Note II as collateral, MWV TN II received $774.0 million in proceeds under a secured financing agreement with a bank (together with the borrowing collateralized by Timber Note I, the Timber Loans). Under the terms of the agreement, the liability from this transaction is non-recourse to WestRock and is payable from Timber Note II proceeds upon its maturity in December 2023. As a result, Timber Note II is not available to satisfy any obligations of WestRock. MWV TN II can elect to prepay, at any time, the liability in whole or in part, with sufficient notice, but would avail itself of this provision only in the event Timber Note II was prepaid in whole or in part. The secured financing agreement, however, requires a mandatory repayment, up to the amount of cash received, if Timber Note II is prepaid in whole or in part. Timber Note II and the secured financing liability were fair valued on the opening balance sheet in connection with the Combination.\nThe restricted assets and non-recourse liabilities held by SPEs, which we consolidate as variable interest entities, are included in the consolidated balance sheets in the following (in millions):\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nSeptember 30,\nOther current assets\n$\n862.1\n$\n-\nOther noncurrent assets\n$\n382.7\n$\n1,253.0\nOther current liabilities\n$\n776.7\n$\n-\nOther noncurrent liabilities\n$\n330.2\n$\n1,117.8\nThe decrease in Other noncurrent assets and Other noncurrent liabilities subsequent to September 30, 2022 reflects one of the Timber Notes becoming current in December 2022.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the aggregate fair value of the Timber Notes was $1,257.2 million and $1,278.3 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the fair value of the Non-recourse Liabilities was $1,112.4 million and $1,132.3 million, respectively. Fair values of the Timber Notes and Non-recourse Liabilities are classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe restricted assets and non-recourse liabilities have the following activity (in millions):\nSeptember 30,\nInterest income on Timber Notes (1)\n$\n56.0\n$\n41.1\n$\n38.7\nInterest expense on Timber Loans (1)\n$\n50.0\n$\n37.2\n$\n35.2\nCash receipts on Timber Notes (2)\n$\n61.4\n$\n46.5\n$\n45.9\nCash payments on Timber Loans (2)\n$\n57.6\n$\n44.9\n$\n44.7\n(1)Presented in Interest expense, net on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(2)Included as part of operating cash flows on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nNote 18. Related Party Transactions\nWe sell products to affiliated companies. Net sales to the affiliated companies for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were approximately $139.6 million, $238.5 million and $237.7 million, respectively. Accounts receivable due from affiliated companies at September 30, 2023 and 2022 were $23.0 million and $27.2 million, respectively, and were included in Accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets. The decline in net sales to affiliated companies in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to the Mexico Acquisition and the sale of an unconsolidated displays joint venture.\nNote 19. Commitments and Contingencies\nCapital Additions\nEstimated costs for future purchases of fixed assets that we are obligated to purchase as of September 30, 2023 total approximately $353 million.\nEnvironmental\nEnvironmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business. Our manufacturing processes involve the use of natural resources, such as virgin wood fiber and fresh water, discharges to water, air emissions and waste handling and disposal activities. These processes are subject to numerous federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations, as well as the requirements of environmental permits and similar authorizations issued by various governmental authorities. Complex and lengthy processes may be required to obtain and renew approvals, permits, and licenses for new, existing or modified facilities. Additionally, the use and handling of various chemicals or hazardous materials require release prevention plans and emergency\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nresponse procedures. Our integrated chemical pulping mills in the U.S. and Brazil are subject to numerous and more complex environmental programs and regulations, but all of WestRocks manufacturing facilities have environmental compliance obligations. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations including, for example, projects to replace and/or upgrade our air pollution control devices, wastewater treatment systems, and other environmental infrastructure. Changes in these laws, as well as litigation relating to these laws, could result in more stringent or additional environmental compliance obligations for the Company that may require additional capital investments or increase our operating costs.\nWe are involved in various administrative and other proceedings relating to environmental matters that arise in the normal course of business, and we may become involved in similar matters in the future. Although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted and we cannot at this time estimate any reasonably possible losses based on available information, we do not believe that the currently expected outcome of any environmental proceedings and claims that are pending or threatened against us will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nEnvironmental regulations in the U.S. and Canada will require our power boilers at certain WestRock mills to meet more stringent nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission standards beginning in 2026. In the U.S., the EPA recently finalized a regulation, known as the Good Neighbor Plan, that is intended to reduce ozone-forming emissions of nitrogen oxides from industrial facilities in 20 states during the ozone season (May through September). In Canada, the government is implementing the Multi-Sector Air Pollutants Regulation, which establishes tighter NOx limits for boilers and heaters in several industries, including pulp and paper. Our preliminary analysis indicates that to meet these new requirements, we need to reduce NOx emissions from nine power boilers at four mills in the U.S. and one in Canada. Our environmental and engineering teams are working on strategies for meeting these new limits. Based on our initial assessment, we do not believe the costs of compliance will be material; however, litigation has been filed in several jurisdictions challenging the Good Neighbor Plan, and it is currently unclear how these ongoing legal proceedings may impact future obligations under this regulatory program.\nWe face potential liability under federal, state, local and international laws as a result of releases, or threatened releases, of hazardous substances into the environment from various sites owned and operated by third parties at which Company-generated wastes have allegedly been deposited. Generators of hazardous substances sent to off-site disposal locations at which environmental contamination exists, as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons, are liable for response costs for the investigation and remediation of such sites under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and analogous laws. While joint and several liability is authorized under CERCLA, liability is typically shared with other potentially responsible or liable parties and costs are commonly allocated according to relative amounts of waste deposited and other factors.\nIn addition, certain of our current or former locations are being investigated or remediated under various environmental laws, including CERCLA. Based on information known to us and assumptions, we do not believe that the costs of these investigation and remediation projects will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the discovery of contamination or the imposition of additional obligations, including natural resources damages at these or other sites in the future, could impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe believe that we can assert claims for indemnification pursuant to existing rights we have under certain purchase and other agreements in connection with certain remediation sites. In addition, we believe that we have insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles or retentions, policy limits and other conditions, for certain environmental matters. However, we may not be successful with respect to any claim regarding these insurance or indemnification rights and, if we are successful, any amounts paid pursuant to the insurance or indemnification rights may not be sufficient to cover all our costs and expenses. We also cannot predict whether we will be required to perform remediation projects at other locations, and it is possible that our remediation requirements and costs could increase materially in the future and exceed current reserves. In addition, we cannot currently determine the impact that future changes in cleanup standards or federal, state or other environmental laws, regulations or enforcement practices will have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had $9.6 million reserved for environmental liabilities on an undiscounted basis, of which $3.3 million is included in Other noncurrent liabilities and $6.3 million is included in Other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, including amounts accrued in connection with environmental obligations relating to manufacturing facilities that we have closed. We believe the liability for these matters was adequately reserved at September 30, 2023.\nClimate Change\nClimate change presents risks and uncertainties for us. With respect to physical risks, our physical assets and infrastructure, including our manufacturing operations, have been, and may be in future periods impacted by weather-related events such as hurricanes and floods, potentially resulting in items such as physical damage to our facilities and lost production. Unpredictable weather patterns or extended periods of severe weather also may result in supply chain disruptions and increased material costs, such as through impacts to virgin fiber supplies and prices, which may fluctuate during prolonged periods of heavy rain or drought, during tree disease or insect epidemics or other environmental conditions that may be caused by variations in climate conditions. To the extent that severe weather or other climate-related risks materialize, and we are unprepared for them, we may incur unexpected costs, which could have a material effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock may be adversely impacted.\nResponses to climate change may result in regulatory risks as new laws and regulations aimed at reducing GHG emissions come into effect. These rules and regulations could take the form of cap-and-trade, carbon taxes, or GHG reductions mandates for utilities that could increase the cost of purchased electricity. New climate rules and regulations also may result in higher fossil fuel prices or fuel efficiency standards that could increase transportation costs. Certain jurisdictions in which we have manufacturing facilities or other investments have already taken actions to address climate change. In addition to national efforts, some U.S. states in which we have manufacturing operations, including Washington, New York and Virginia, are taking measures to reduce GHG emissions, such as requiring GHG emissions reporting or developing regional cap-and-trade programs.\nSeveral of our international facilities are located in countries that have already adopted GHG emissions trading programs. Other countries in which we conduct business, including China, European Union member states and India, have set GHG reduction targets in accordance with the agreement among over 170 countries that established the Paris Agreement, which became effective in November 2016 and which the United States formally rejoined in February 2021.\nWe have systems in place for tracking the GHG emissions from our energy-intensive facilities, and we monitor developments in climate-related laws, regulations and policies to assess the potential impact of such developments on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and disclosure obligations. Compliance with climate programs may require future expenditures to meet GHG emission reduction obligations in future years. These obligations may include carbon taxes, the requirement to purchase GHG credits, or the need to acquire carbon offsets. Also, we may be required to make capital and other investments to displace traditional fossil fuels, such as fuel oil and coal, with lower carbon alternatives, such as biomass and natural gas.\nBrazil Tax Liability\nWe are challenging claims by the Brazil Federal Revenue Department that we underpaid tax, penalties and interest associated with a claim that a subsidiary of MeadWestvaco Corporation (the predecessor of WestRock MWV, LLC) had reduced its tax liability related to the goodwill generated by the 2002 merger of two of its Brazilian subsidiaries. The matter has proceeded through the Brazil Administrative Council of Tax Appeals (CARF) principally in two proceedings, covering tax years 2003 to 2008 and 2009 to 2012. The tax and interest claim relating to tax years 2009 to 2012 was finalized and is now the subject of an annulment action we filed in the Brazil federal court. CARF notified us of its final decision regarding the tax, penalties and interest claims relating to tax years 2003 to 2008 on June 3, 2020. We have filed an annulment action in Brazil federal court with respect to that decision as\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nwell. The dispute related to fraud penalties for tax years 2009 to 2012 was resolved by CARF in favor of WestRock effective January 23, 2023.\nWe assert that we have no liability in these matters. The total amount in dispute before CARF and in the annulment actions relating to the claimed tax deficiency was R$714 million ($143 million) as of September 30, 2023, including various penalties and interest. The U.S. dollar equivalent has fluctuated significantly due to changes in exchange rates. The amount of our uncertain tax position reserve for this matter, which excludes certain penalties, is included in the unrecognized tax benefits table. See Note 7. Income Taxes. Resolution of the uncertain tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations or materially benefit our results of operations in future periods depending upon their ultimate resolution.\nOther Litigation\nDuring fiscal 2018, we submitted formal notification to withdraw from the PIUMPF and recorded a liability associated with the withdrawal. Subsequently, in fiscal 2019 and 2020, we received demand letters from PIUMPF, including a demand for withdrawal liabilities and for our proportionate share of PIUMPFs accumulated funding deficiency, and we refined our liability, the impact of which was not significant. We began making monthly payments for the PIUMPF withdrawal liabilities in fiscal 2020, excluding the accumulated funding deficiency demands. We dispute the PIUMPF accumulated funding deficiency demands. In February 2020, we received a demand letter from PIUMPF asserting that we owe $51.2 million for our pro-rata share of PIUMPFs accumulated funding deficiency, including interest. Similarly, in April 2020, we received an updated demand letter related to a subsidiary of ours asserting that we owe $1.3 million of additional accumulated funding deficiency, including interest. The subsidiary for which we received the updated demand letter was sold in September 2023. In July 2021, the PIUMPF filed suit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia claiming the right to recover our pro rata share of the pension funds accumulated funding deficiency, along with interest, liquidated damages and attorneys fees. We believe we are adequately reserved for this matter. See Note 6. Retirement Plans - Multiemployer Plans of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our withdrawal liabilities.\nWe have been named a defendant in asbestos-related personal injury litigation. To date, the costs resulting from the litigation, including settlement costs, have not been significant. As of September 30, 2023, there were approximately 600 such lawsuits. We believe that we have substantial insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles and policy limits, with respect to asbestos claims. We also have valid defenses to these asbestos-related personal injury claims and intend to continue to defend them vigorously. Should the volume of litigation grow substantially, it is possible that we could incur significant costs resolving these cases. We do not expect the resolution of pending asbestos litigation and proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. At September 30, 2023, we had $13.7 million reserved for these matters.\nWe are a defendant in a number of other lawsuits and claims arising out of the conduct of our business. While the ultimate results of such suits or other proceedings against us cannot be predicted, we believe the resolution of these other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nIndirect Tax Claim\nIn March 2017, the Supreme Court of Brazil issued a decision concluding that certain state value added tax should not be included in the calculation of federal gross receipts taxes. Subsequently, in fiscal 2019 and 2020, the Supreme Court of Brazil rendered favorable decisions on eight of our cases granting us the right to recover certain state value added tax. The tax authorities in Brazil filed a Motion of Clarification with the Supreme Court of Brazil. Based on our evaluation and the opinion of our tax and legal advisors, we believe the decision reduced our gross receipts tax in Brazil prospectively and retrospectively, and will allow us to recover tax amounts collected by the government. Due to the volume of invoices being reviewed (January 2002 to September 2019), we recorded the estimated recoveries across several periods beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 as we reviewed the documents and the amount became estimable. In May 2021, the Supreme Court of Brazil judged the Motion of\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nClarification and concluded on the gross methodology, which was consistent with our evaluation and that of our tax and legal advisors. In fiscal 2021, we recorded a receivable for our expected recovery and interest that consisted primarily of a $0.6 million reduction of Cost of goods sold and $0.3 million reduction of Interest expense, net. In fiscal 2023, we recorded a receivable for our expected recovery and interest that consisted of a $4.4 million reduction of Cost of goods sold and $4.7 million reduction of Interest expense, net. We are monitoring the status of our remaining cases, and subject to the resolution in the courts, we may record additional amounts in future periods.\nGuarantees\nWe make certain guarantees in the normal course of conducting our operations for compliance with certain laws and regulations, or in connection with certain business transactions. The guarantees include items such as funding of net losses in proportion to our ownership share of certain joint ventures, debt guarantees related to certain unconsolidated entities acquired in acquisitions, indemnifications of lessors in certain facilities and equipment operating leases for items such as additional taxes being assessed due to a change in tax law and certain other agreements. We estimate our exposure to these matters to be less than $50 million. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had recorded $0.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for the estimated fair value of these guarantees. We are unable to estimate our maximum exposure under operating leases because it is dependent on potential changes in the tax laws; however, we believe our exposure related to guarantees would not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nNote 20.

Stockholders Equity\nCapitalization\nOur capital stock consists solely of Common Stock. Holders of our Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes preferred stock, of which no shares have been issued. The terms and provisions of such shares will be determined by our board of directors upon any issuance of such shares in accordance with our certificate of incorporation.\nStock Repurchase Plan\nIn July 2015, our board of directors authorized a repurchase program of up to 40.0 million shares of our Common Stock, representing approximately 15% of our outstanding Common Stock as of July 1, 2015. On May 4, 2022, our board of directors authorized a new repurchase program of up to 25.0 million shares of our Common Stock, plus any unutilized shares left from the July 2015 authorization. The 25.0 million shares represented an additional authorization of approximately 10% of our outstanding Common Stock. The shares of our Common Stock may be repurchased over an indefinite period of time at the discretion of management. In fiscal 2023, we repurchased no shares of our Common Stock. In fiscal 2022, we repurchased approximately 12.6 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate cost of $597.5 million. In fiscal 2021, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate cost of $125.1 million. The amount reflected as purchased in the consolidated statements of cash flows varies due to the timing of share settlement. As of September 30, 2023, we had approximately 29.0 million shares of Common Stock available for repurchase under the program, although we have indefinitely suspended the program in light of the proposed Transaction (and related restrictions imposed by the Transaction Agreement).\nNote 22.\tShare-Based Compensation\t\t\t\t\nShare-based Compensation Plans\nAt our Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on January 29, 2021, our stockholders approved the WestRock Company 2020 Incentive Stock Plan. The 2020 Incentive Stock Plan, as approved by our stockholders on January 28, 2022, allows for the granting of 8.4 million shares of options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and SARs to employees and our non-employee directors. As of September 30, 2023, there were 0.6 million shares available to be granted under this plan, assuming the performance stock units previously granted vest at maximum. At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on February 2, 2016, our stockholders approved the WestRock Company 2016 Incentive Stock Plan. The 2016 Incentive Stock Plan was amended and restated on February 2, 2018 (the Amended and Restated 2016 Incentive Stock Plan). The Amended and Restated 2016 Incentive Stock Plan, adjusted for a prior corporate action, allows for the granting of 12.8 million shares of options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and SARs to employees and our non-employee directors. As of September 30, 2023, there were 0.4 million shares available to be granted under this plan, assuming the performance stock units previously granted vest at maximum. In addition, there were 12.7 million shares available for grant under prior plans approved by stockholders and plans assumed upon mergers and acquisitions and we do not expect to make any new awards under those plans.\nOur results of operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 include share-based compensation expense of $64.2 million, $93.3 million and $88.6 million, respectively. The total income tax benefit in the results of operations in connection with share-based compensation was $16.0 million, $23.3 million and $22.3 million, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCash received from share-based payment arrangements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $13.7 million, $28.9 million and $57.5 million, respectively.\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\nIn fiscal 2023, we granted restricted stock units to non-employee directors and certain of our employees. These grants represent the right to receive one share of Common Stock upon satisfaction of specified conditions. The\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nvesting provisions for our employee awards may vary from grant to grant; however, vesting generally is contingent upon meeting various service and/or performance or market goals including, but not limited to, achievement of various financial targets such as, with respect to fiscal 2023, Return on Invested Capital, Adjusted Earnings Per Share and relative Total Shareholder Return (each as defined in the award documents). Subject to the level of performance attained, the target award for our grants with a performance or market condition generally may increase up to 200% of target or decrease to zero depending upon the terms of the individual grant. The employee grants with only a service condition generally vest over three years in one-third increments subsequent to fiscal 2021. The employee grants with only a service condition in fiscal 2021 and employee grants with a performance or market condition generally vest in three years. Presently, other than circumstances such as death, disability and retirement, the grants to employees generally include a provision requiring both a change of control and termination of employment to accelerate vesting. The grantee is entitled to receive dividend equivalent units but will generally forfeit the restricted stock unit award and the dividend equivalents if the employee separates from us during the vesting period or if the predetermined goals are not accomplished. Our non-employee director awards generally vest over a period of up to one year and carry a service condition. Prior to fiscal 2022, our non-employee directors received their equity awards in the form of restricted stock, which carried dividend and voting rights prior to vesting.\nThe table below summarizes the changes in restricted stock units during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023:\nUnits\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant Date Fair\nValue\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022 (1)\n4,900,629\n$\n43.73\nGranted\n3,066,748\n35.22\nVested and released\n(2,131,067\n)\n40.91\nForfeited\n(558,177\n)\n41.23\nOutstanding at September 30, 2023 (1)\n5,278,133\n$\n40.19\n(1)Target awards granted with a performance condition, net of subsequent forfeitures, may be increased up to 200% of the target or decreased to zero, subject to the level of performance attained. The awards are reflected in the table at the target award amount of 100%. Based on current facts and assumptions, we are forecasting the performance of the aggregate outstanding grants to be attained at levels below target. However, actual performance may vary.\nThere was approximately $89.5 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to all unvested restricted stock units as of September 30, 2023 to be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting period of 1.5 years.\nThe following table represents a summary of restricted stock units and restricted stock granted in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 with terms defined in the applicable grant letters (in units/shares).\nGranted to employees:\nGranted with a service condition\n1,419,255\n1,159,255\n1,009,387\nGranted with a service condition and a Return on\nInvested Capital performance condition at target\n540,425\n394,655\n-\nGranted with a service condition and a Cash Flow Per\nShare performance condition at target\n-\n464,485\n798,490\nGranted with a service condition and an Adjusted Earnings\nPer Share performance condition at target\n644,755\n-\n-\nGranted with a service condition and a relative Total\nShareholder Return market condition at target\n69,560\n45,470\n127,050\nGranted for attainment of a performance condition at\nan amount in excess of target (1)\n341,590\n263,918\n-\nGranted for annual bonus (2)\n-\n-\n126,984\nGranted to non-employee directors\n51,163\n37,771\n42,482\nTotal grants\n3,066,748\n2,365,554\n2,104,393\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(1)Grants include shares issued for the level of performance attained in excess of target. Shares issued in fiscal 2023 for the fiscal 2020 Cash Flow Per Share measure were at 151.8% of target. Shares issued in fiscal 2022 for the fiscal 2019 Cash Flow Per Share measure were at 151.3% of target. Shares issued in fiscal 2021 for the fiscal 2018 Cash Flow Per Share measure were at 89.3% of target, therefore, the remainder of the grant was forfeited.\n(2)Reflects shares issued at 105% of target in fiscal 2021 relating to fiscal 2020 restricted stock units granted for the annual bonus.\nThe employee grants with a relative Total Shareholder Return market condition in fiscal 2023 were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation at $39.72 per unit. The significant assumptions used in valuing these grants included: an expected term of 3.0 years, an expected volatility of 47.2% and a risk-free interest rate of 4.0%.\nThe employee grants with a relative Total Shareholder Return market condition in fiscal 2022 were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation at $60.83 per unit. The significant assumptions used in valuing these grants included: an expected term of 3.0 years, an expected volatility of 46.7% and a risk-free interest rate of 1.5%.\nThe employee grants with a relative Total Shareholder Return market condition in fiscal 2021 were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation at $53.69 per unit. The significant assumptions used in valuing these grants included: an expected term of 3.0 years, an expected volatility of 46.2% and a risk-free interest rate of 0.2%. In addition, we had a subsequent grant for an individual valued using a Monte Carlo simulation at $70.80 per unit, using an expected term of 2.9 years, an expected volatility of 47.0% and a risk-free rate of 0.3%.\nExpense is recognized on restricted stock units and restricted stock on a straight-line basis over the explicit service period or for performance-based grants over the explicit service period when we estimate that it is probable the performance conditions will be satisfied. Expense recognized on grants with a performance condition that affects how many units are ultimately awarded is based on the number of units expected to be awarded.\nThe following table represents a summary of restricted stock units and restricted stock vested and released as well as the corresponding aggregate fair value in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions, except units/shares):\nVested and released\n2,131,067\n1,512,550\n3,194,223\nAggregate fair value\n$\n72.6\n$\n68.7\n$\n125.1\nStock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights\nWe did not grant any stock options or SARs in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. Outstanding stock options granted under our plans generally have an exercise price equal to the closing market price on the date of the grant, generally vested in three years, in either one tranche or in approximately one-third increments, and have 10-year contractual terms. However, a portion of our grants are subject to earlier expense recognition due to retirement eligibility rules. Presently, other than circumstances such as death, disability and retirement, grants will include a provision requiring both a change of control and termination of employment to accelerate vesting.\nWhen options are granted, we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. We use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations in determining the expected term in years for stock options. Expected volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of our stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury securities in effect at the date of the grant of the stock options. The dividend yield is estimated based on our historical annual dividend payments and current expectations for the future.\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe table below summarizes the changes in stock options during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023:\nStock\nOptions\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\nWeighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nTerm\n(in years)\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\n(in millions)\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022\n1,082,925\n$\n40.22\nExercised\n(120,018\n)\n28.83\nExpired\n(262,375\n)\n40.04\nOutstanding at September 30, 2023\n700,532\n$\n42.24\n1.3\n$\n2.0\nExercisable at September 30, 2023\n700,532\n$\n42.24\n1.3\n$\n2.0\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $0.8 million, $8.6 million and $29.1 million, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2023, there was no remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options.\nAs part of the Combination, we issued SARs to replace outstanding MWV SARs. The SARs were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We measured compensation expense related to the SAR awards at the end of each period. There were no SARs outstanding during the year ended September 30, 2023, and we do not expect to issue additional SARs. The aggregate intrinsic value of SARs exercised during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nAt our Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on February 2, 2016, our stockholders approved the WestRock Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). Under the ESPP, shares of Common Stock are reserved for purchase by our qualifying employees. The ESPP allowed for the purchase of a total of approximately 2.5 million shares of Common Stock. During fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, employees purchased approximately 0.4 million, 0.3 million and 0.3 million shares, respectively, under the ESPP. We recognized $1.7 million, $1.8 million and $1.9 million of expense for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to the 15% discount on the purchase price allowed to employees. As of September 30, 2023, approximately 0.6 million shares of Common Stock remained available for purchase under the ESPP, although the ESPP will be suspended following the November 2023 purchase period in light of the proposed Transaction (and related obligations imposed by the Transaction Agreement).\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNote 23.

The restricted stock grants to non-employee directors prior to fiscal 2022 were considered participating securities as they received non-forfeitable rights to dividends at the same rate as our Common Stock. As participating securities, we included these instruments in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two-class method described in ASC 260, Earnings per Share.\nApproximately 2.5 million, 0.5 million and 0.5 million shares underlying awards in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were not included in computing diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been antidilutive.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of\nWestRock Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of WestRock Company (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated November 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment of the Corrugated Packaging Reporting Unit\nDescription of the Matter\nAs discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level on July 1 or more frequently if events or change in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not to be impaired. This requires management to estimate the fair value of the reporting units based on the discounted cash flow method or, as appropriate, a combination of the discounted cash flow method and guideline public-company method. The Company performed an interim impairment test as of March 1, 2023, and recorded an impairment charge of $1,893.0 million, of which $514.3 million related to the Corrugated Packaging reporting unit. As of September 30, 2023, the Companys goodwill balance totaled $4,248.7 million, of which $2,603.7 million related to the Corrugated Packaging reporting unit.\nAuditing managements goodwill impairment tests for the Corrugated Packaging reporting unit involved especially subjective judgments due to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the estimates of the fair value for the Companys Corrugated Packaging reporting unit are sensitive to assumptions such as the discount rate, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiples for comparable guideline companies and expected future net cash flows, including projected revenue and EBITDA margins, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys goodwill impairment review process. For example, we tested controls over the estimation of the fair values of the reporting unit, including the Companys controls over the valuation model, the mathematical accuracy of the valuation models, the development of underlying assumptions used to estimate such fair values of the reporting unit and the clerical accuracy of the interim impairment charge. We also tested managements review of the reconciliation of the aggregate estimated fair values of the reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company.\nTo test the estimated fair values of the Companys Corrugated Packaging reporting unit, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the valuation methodology, determination of the guideline public companies, and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis, including testing the significant assumptions discussed above. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, changes to the Companys business model and other relevant factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of managements assumptions of future expected net cash flows and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair values of the reporting unit that would result from changes in the assumptions. We involved valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the valuation methodology and the significant assumptions, including the discount rate used in determining the fair values of the reporting unit.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nDescription of the Matter\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has unrecognized income tax benefits of $405.1 million related to its uncertain tax positions at September 30, 2023. The Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, and (2) in measuring the tax benefit as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company does not record any benefit for tax positions that do not meet the more-likely-than-not initial recognition threshold.\nAuditing managements analysis of its uncertain tax positions and resulting unrecognized income tax benefits involved especially subjective and complex judgments because each tax position carries unique facts and circumstances that require interpretation of laws, regulations and legal rulings, and other factors.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe tested the Companys controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to uncertain tax positions. For example, we tested controls over managements application of the two-step recognition and measurement principles, including managements review of the inputs and resulting calculations of unrecognized income tax benefits.\nTo test the Companys measurement and recording of its uncertain tax positions, our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting the Companys analysis and related tax opinions to evaluate the assumptions the Company used to develop its uncertain tax positions and related unrecognized income tax benefit amounts by jurisdiction. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company to calculate its uncertain tax positions. For example, we compared the recorded unrecognized income tax benefits to similar positions in prior periods and assessed managements consideration of current tax controversy and litigation trends in similar positions challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we involved tax subject matter resources to evaluate the application of relevant tax laws in the Companys recognition determination. We also evaluated the Companys income tax disclosures in relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Companys or its predecessors auditor since at least 1975, but we are unable to determine the specific year.\nAtlanta, Georgia\nNovember 17, 2023\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of\nWestRock Company\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited WestRock Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, WestRock Company (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Managements Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, managements assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Gondi S.A. de C.V. (Gondi), which is included in the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted $2.7 billion of total assets as of September 30, 2023 and $1.1 billion of revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Gondi.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated November 17, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nAtlanta, Georgia\nNovember 17, 2023\nWESTROCK COMPANY\nMANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nManagements Responsibility for the Financial Statements\nThe management of WestRock Company is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial statements were prepared in conformity with GAAP appropriate in the circumstances and, accordingly, include certain amounts based on our best judgments and estimates. Financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is consistent with that in the financial statements.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a written code(s) of conduct adopted by our board of directors that is applicable to all officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries, as well as a code of conduct that is applicable to all of our directors.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). The scope of our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to fiscal 2023 included all of our operations other than those we acquired in fiscal 2023 related to the Mexico Acquisition. In accordance with the SEC's published guidance, we excluded these operations from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, because we acquired these operations during the fiscal year. Total assets as of September 30, 2023 and total revenues for the year ending September 30, 2023 for the operations acquired in the Mexico Acquisition were $2.7 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. The SEC's published guidance specifies that the period in which management may omit an assessment of an acquired business's internal control over financial reporting from its assessment of the Company's internal control may not extend beyond one year from the date of acquisition. Based on our assessment, which as discussed herein excluded the operations acquired in the Mexico Acquisition, management believes that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. Our independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit Committee of our board of directors. Ernst & Young LLP has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of WestRock Company, and has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The report of the independent registered public accounting firm is contained in this Annual Report.\nAudit Committee Responsibility\nThe Audit Committee of our board of directors, composed solely of directors who are independent in accordance with the requirements of the NYSE listing standards, the Exchange Act and our Corporate Governance Guidelines, meets with the independent auditors, management and internal auditors periodically to discuss internal control over financial reporting and auditing and financial reporting matters. The Audit Committee reviews with the independent auditors the scope and results of the audit effort. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the independent auditors and the chief internal auditor without management present to ensure that the independent auditors and the chief internal auditor have full access to the Audit Committee. Our Audit Committees Report will be contained in our definitive proxy statement issued in connection with our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference.\nDAVID B. SEWELL,\nChief Executive Officer and President\nALEXANDER W. PEASE,\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nNovember 17, 2023 Item 9.\tCHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nThere were no changes in or disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure. Item 9A.\tCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring the following:\nthat information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms; and\nthat information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and our Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nWe have performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2023, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2023, to provide reasonable assurance that we record, process, summarize and report the information we must disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, we completed the Mexico Acquisition. Subsequent to the Mexico Acquisition, we have begun controls assessment and integration activities. See Note 3. Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In accordance with the SEC's published guidance, we excluded these operations from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, because we acquired these operations during the current fiscal year. The SEC's published guidance specifies that the period in which management may omit an assessment of an acquired business's internal control over financial reporting from its assessment of the Company's internal control may not extend beyond one year from the date of acquisition.\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do. Management also noted that the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and that there can be no assurance that any such design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe report called for by Item 308(a) of Regulation S-K is incorporated herein by reference to Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting of WestRock Company, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nThe attestation report called for by Item 308(b) of Regulation S-K is incorporated herein by reference to the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nManagement has evaluated, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. In connection with that evaluation, we have determined that there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the\nfourth quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
