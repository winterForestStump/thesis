Backlog is not a measure defined by generally accepted accounting principles and is not a measure of contract profitability. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to methodologies used by other companies in determining their backlog amounts. The backlog values we disclose include anticipated revenues associated with: (1) the original agreement amounts; (2) change orders for which we have received written confirmations from the applicable customers; (3) change orders for which we expect to receive confirmations in the ordinary course of business; and (4) claims that we have made against customers. We do not include expected revenues of agreements related to unconsolidated joint ventures in our backlog, except to the extent of any contract awards we may receive from those joint ventures.\nFor amounts included in backlog that are attributable to claims, we include unapproved claims in backlog when we have a legal basis to do so, consider collection to be probable and believe we can reliably estimate the ultimate value. Claims revenue is included in backlog to the extent of the lesser of the amounts management expects to recover or associated costs incurred.\nBacklog may not be indicative of future operating results, and agreements in our backlog may be cancelled, modified or otherwise altered by customers. We can provide no assurance as to the profitability of our contracts reflected in backlog.\nThe Dalrada Precision Manufacturing segment has generated a backlog of approximately $900,000,000 over a seven-year period with approximately $40,000,000 within the initial twelve-month period.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal Operating Expenses increased to $30,019,876, or 43.5%, compared to last years expenses of $20,941,591.\nCorporate\nTotal Corporate expenses increased to $11,660,710, or 7.5%, compared to last years expenses of $10,849,022.\nThe Corporate segments Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses consist of the following:\n\u00b7 Employee compensation and benefits decreased by $604,188, or 11.8% from the prior year and is primarily a result of the Company allocating resources from the Corporate segment to each specific segment; shared resources across the four other business segments were included in the Corporate segment in the prior year.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\nWe regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in note (1) of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.\nAccrued Payroll Taxes\nThe total balance for Federal Accrued Payroll Taxes is accumulated on a quarterly basis beginning on their respective quarterly filing dates. Accrued Interest is compounded daily at an Effective Annual Interest Rate of approximately seven percent. The individual quarterly sub-totals have a calculated expiration date of ten years according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) statute of limitations. This timeline can be extended because of bankruptcy or other legal action that is filed by the Company (Code 520 per IRS Federal Account Transcripts). Code 520 effectively stops the clock for the Statute of limitations until the bankruptcy or other legal action has been removed (Code 521 per IRS Federal Account Transcripts). In addition to the number of days between Code 520 and 521, every Code 520 automatically extends the IRS Statute of limitations by 30 days. As the quarterly sub-totals surpass their respective Calculated Expiration Date the Company removes the liability from the Consolidated Balance Sheets and an equivalent amount is recognized as Gain on expiration of accrued payroll taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The amount owing may be subject to additional late filing fees and penalties that are not quantifiable as at the date of these consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes and accounts for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 as a principal on the sale of goods and services. Pursuant to ASC 606, revenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.\nUse of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the revenue, valuation of inventory, valuation of acquired assets and liabilities, variables used in the computation of share-based compensation, litigation, and evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment.\nThe Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Companys estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value using quoted market prices of the equity instruments issued.\nBusiness Combination\nASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations to all acquisitions where the acquirer gains a controlling interest, regardless of whether consideration was exchanged. ASC 805 establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: a) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; b) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and c) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. Accounting for acquisitions requires the Company to recognize, separately from goodwill, the assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, the estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded with a corresponding gain or loss being recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (ASC 350). ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives should be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (June 30 for the Company) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company considers its market capitalization and the carrying value of its assets and liabilities, including goodwill, when performing its goodwill impairment test. When conducting its annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company initially performs a qualitative evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. If it is determined by a qualitative evaluation that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, the Company then applies a two-step impairment test. The two-step impairment test first compares the fair value of the Company's reporting unit to its carrying or book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company determines the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company recorded an impairment of goodwill in the amount of $433,556 and $218,308 during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAn intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. Such an asset is identifiable when it is separable, or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights. Separable assets can be sold, transferred, licensed, etc. Examples of intangible assets include computer software, licenses, trademarks, patents, films and copyrights. The Companys intangible assets are finite lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nUpon the completion of a business combination, the consideration transferred as well as the assets and liabilities acquired must be recorded at their acquisition date fair values. Upon identification of the acquirer and determination of the acquisition date, business combinations are accounted for through the preparation of a Purchase Price Allocation (PPA). We take into consideration the five steps when completing a PPA:\nStep 1: Determine the fair value of consideration paid;\nStep 2: Revalue all existing assets and liabilities (excluding intangible assets and goodwill which are addressed in step 3 to 5 below) to their acquisition date fair values;\nStep 3: Identify the intangible assets acquired;\nStep 4: Determine the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired; and,\nStep 5: Allocate the remaining consideration to goodwill and assess the reasonableness of the overall conclusion\nRelated Party Transactions\nRelated party transactions are conducted with parties with which the Company has a close association, such as majority owned subsidiaries, its executive, managers, and their families. The types of transactions that can be conducted between related parties are many, such as sales, asset transfers, leases, lending arrangements, guarantees, allocations of common costs, and the filing of consolidated tax returns. The Company discloses any transaction that would impact the decision making of the users of its consolidated financial statements. This involves the following disclosures:\n\u00b7 General. The Company discloses all material related party transactions, including the nature of the relationship, the nature of the transactions, the dollar amounts of the transactions, the amounts due to or from related parties.\n\u00b7 Receivables. The Company separately discloses any receivables from officers, employees, or affiliated entities.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity, as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among other changes, the new guidance removes from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated into a debt and equity component, unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the debt is issued at a substantial premium. As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded conversion features in equity, and will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of the if-converted method when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent with the Companys current accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company adopted the guidance on July 1, 2022.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08 - Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2021-08). Under current accounting standards, contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination are to be recorded at fair value using the ASC 805 measurement principle. ASU 2021-08 requires the acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers as if the acquirer had originated the contracts rather than at fair value. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2021-08 on a prospective basis as of July 1, 2021. The election to use practical expedients allowed under ASU 2021-08 will be applied on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. There was no impact to the Companys consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date.\nThe FASB and the SEC have issued certain other accounting pronouncements as of June 30, 2023 that will become effective in subsequent periods; however, management does not believe that any of these pronouncements would have significantly affected the Companys financial accounting measurements or disclosures had they been in effect during the periods for which financial statements are included in this annual report, nor does management believe those pronouncements would have a significant effect on the Companys future financial position or results of operations\nContractual Obligations\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.

Financial Statements\nDALRADA FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nFor the Years Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity (Deficit)\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (PCAOB ID N0. 324)\nTo the Board of Directors and\nStockholders of Dalrada Financial Corporation\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Dalrada Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from operating activities and continues to have a working capital deficit. This raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nImpairment Assessment of Goodwill\nDescription of the Matter:\nAs discussed in Notes 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had a number of business combinations during the current and prior fiscal years that led to the recording of goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of ASC No. 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (ASC No. 350). We identified the impairment assessment of the Companys goodwill acquired in these acquisitions as a critical audit matter as of June 30, 2023. Auditing the Companys impairment tests was complex and highly judgmental because (i) there was significant judgment used by management to develop the fair value measurement, which led to a high degree of audit judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures relating to fair value measurement; and (ii) there was significant effort in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value measurement and significant assumptions and projections used by management.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in our Audit:\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. To test the potential impairment of the Companys goodwill, our audit procedures included, among others, testing managements application of the relevant accounting guidance, and testing of the significant assumptions used by the Company to develop forecasted results for the reporting unit, including projected revenue growth and operating margins. We also assessed the historical accuracy of managements estimates, as well as performed a sensitivity analysis of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions. We compared the significant assumptions to current and past industry, market and economic trends. Additionally, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates\nRevenue Recognition\nDescription of the Matter:\nAs disclosed in Note 2, 9 and 13, the Company follows the guidance provided in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and recognizes revenue when or as the Company satisfies a customer agreement performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. A presumption of fraud risk exists related to revenue recognition and judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for each performance obligation within their customer agreements. We identified the Companys recording of revenues as a critical audit matter because there was significant judgment applied by management in its determination of the appropriate revenue recognition criteria, including assessing the indicators for when control is transferred to the customer, assessing managements evaluation and allocation of the standalone transaction prices to the performance obligations, as well as managements assessment of the impact on revenue recognition of non-standard terms and conditions. In turn, this led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing audit procedures and evaluating the results of those procedures.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in our Audit:\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. Our principal audit procedures related to the Companys revenue recognition included gaining an understanding of internal controls related to revenue recognition including managements controls related to the evaluation of performance obligations and the allocation of the total contract consideration to these performance obligations noted in their customer agreements. We evaluated managements revenue recognition policies and practices including the reasonableness of managements judgments and assumptions relating to the timing of revenue recognition of those performance obligations. In addition, we selected customer agreements and performed the following testing procedures: 1) Obtained and read the customer agreements or contracts for each selected agreement. 2) Evaluated and tested managements identification of significant terms for completeness, including the identification of distinct performance obligations. 3) Tested revenue contracts and underlying support to evaluate appropriateness of managements revenue recognition. 4) Tested the completeness and accuracy of managements calculation of revenue and associated timing of revenue recognized (i.e., revenue being recognized at a point in time vs over time). 5) These procedures also included, among others, testing managements process for developing estimates for contractual allowances and project completion, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the historical contractual allowance and collection data from the Companys billing system, which is an input to the methodology, and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of managements assumptions used to estimate contractual allowances (net accounts), as well as testing relevant inputs and project costs incurred used to develop estimates of project progress compared to the overall project budget.\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2023.\n/s/ Macias Gini & OConnell LLP\nMelville, New York\nOctober 19, 2023\nPCAOB No. 324\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and\nStockholders of Dalrada Financial Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Dalrada Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (collectively the Company) as of June 30, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has had recurring losses, used cash flows from operating activities and has a significant working capital deficit, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRelated Party Transactions including Revenue Recognition\nDescription of the Matter:\nAs discussed in Notes 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has significant related party transactions involving revenue, accounts receivable, accounts payable, loans payable, advances, and expenses paid by and to multiple related parties. Our auditing of managements identification of related parties and the related transactions including recognition of revenue was complex and is based on a thorough understanding the Companys related party relationships, contracts, and business activities. These were the principal considerations that led us to determine this as a critical audit matter.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in our Audit:\nWe evaluated the controls over the Companys identification of, and recording of related party transactions, and of the revenue recognition process, including walkthroughs of internal controls. We confirmed certain balances and transactions with related parties. To evaluate the related partys satisfaction of performance obligations, our audit procedures included, among others, reviewing contracts and evaluating managements assumptions used to determine the distinct performance obligations, and reviewing the branding work performed by the Company for various products. In addition, to identify undisclosed related party transactions we performed the following: 1) made inquiries of management and other individuals throughout the Company; 2) obtained a selection of expenses and reviewed for related party indicators; 3) reviewed public filings and other online information available; 4) confirmed with the transfer agent regarding significant shareholders; and 5) related procedures performed in other parts of the audit engagement.\nRevenue Recognition\nDescription of the Matter:\nAs disclosed in Note 2, 9, and 13, the Company recognizes revenue when or as the Company satisfies a customer agreement performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. In determining revenue recognition for certain customer agreements, significant judgment was exercised by the Company, and included the following: 1) An assessment of the products and services promised in contracts or customer agreements, and the identification of a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a product or service that is distinct. 2) Determination of relative standalone selling price for distinct performance obligations. 3) The timing of product or service delivery for performance obligations. 4) Net revenues and accounts receivable recognized from healthcare insurers and government payers consist of amounts billed net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive from such payers, which considers historical denial and collection experience and, additionally for healthcare insurers, the terms of the Companys contractual arrangements. As disclosed by management, the process for estimating revenues and the ultimate collection of receivables associated involves significant assumptions and judgments. Given these factors, the related audit effort in evaluating managements judgments in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive, which led us to determine this as a critical audit matter.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in our Audit:\nOur principal audit procedures related to the Companys revenue recognition for these customer agreements included an evaluation of the controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations and the determination of the timing of revenue recognition. We also evaluated managements significant accounting policies related to certain customer agreements. In addition, we selected customer agreements and performed the following procedures: 1) Obtained and read the customer agreements or contracts for each selected agreement. 2) Evaluated and tested managements identification of significant terms for completeness, including the identification of distinct performance obligations. 3) Evaluated the appropriateness of managements application of their accounting principles, in their determination of revenue recognition conclusions. 4) Tested the mathematical accuracy of managements calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the consolidated financial statements. 5) These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for developing the estimate for contractual allowances, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the historical contractual allowance and collection data from the Companys billing system, which is an input to the methodology, and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of managements assumptions used to estimate contractual allowances (net accounts receivable).\n/s/ dbbmckennon\nWe have served as the Companys auditor from 2019 to 2022.\nSan Diego, California\nOctober 31, 2022\nPCAOB No. 3501\nDALRADA FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nJune 30, June 30,\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 812,806 $ 772,062\nAccounts receivable, net 4,453,104 6,406,555\nAccounts receivable, net -

As of June 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company had a working capital deficit of $202,420 and $ $9,357,651, respectively. The Company incurred negative cash flows from operations for the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, and raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the successful financing through equity and/or debt investors and growing the subsidiaries anticipated to be profitable while reducing investments in areas that are not expected to have long-term benefits. The Company expects to fund any short-term operational deficits primarily through collection of outstanding accounts receivable from medical insurance providers, Medicare, pharmaceutical sales, the sale of Likido units as well as loans from related parties.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n(a) Basis of Presentation\nThese consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP) and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Companys fiscal year end is June 30.\n(b) Principles of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as the accounts of any entities over which the Company has a controlling financial interest in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810 Consolidation. All transactions and balances between these entities have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Dalrada Financial Corp., Genefic Products Inc., Solas Corp., Empower Genomics, Inc., International Health Group, Inc., Pala Diagnostics, LLC, Pacific Stem Cells, LLC, Watson Rx Solutions, Inc., Shark Innovative Technologies Corp., Dalrada Precision Corp., Dalrada Energy Services, Inc., Likido Corp., Ignite I.T., Bothof Brothers Construction Inc., Prakat Solutions, Inc., Prakat Solutions Private Limited, Likido Ltd., Deposition Technologies Ltd. and Dalrada Technology Ltd., controlled by the Company through its direct or indirect ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of variable interest entities (VIEs) in which the Company has a variable interest and for which the Company is the primary beneficiary as it has both: (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nIncome attributable to the minority interest in the Companys majority owned and controlled consolidated subsidiaries is recorded as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss and the noncontrolling interest is reflected as a separate component of the statement of stockholders equity, consolidated balance sheet, and statement of cash flows.\n(c) Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the revenue, valuation of inventory, valuation of acquired assets and liabilities, variables used in the computation of share-based compensation, litigation, and evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment.\nThe Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Companys estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.\n(d) Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash deposits in financial institutions, and the Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.\n(e) Concentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, and cash equivalents. The Company generally maintains balances in various operating accounts at financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality, in amounts that may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to its cash and cash equivalents and does not believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships.\nWhen estimating its allowance for credit losses related to revenues from Covid Testing, the Company differentiates its receivables based on the following customer types: healthcare insurers, government payers, and cash payers. Additionally, the Company applies assumptions and judgments for assessing collectability and determining net revenues and accounts receivable from its customers. Management considers various historical collection factors for assessing collectability and determining net revenues and accounts receivable from our customers which include the period that the receivables have been outstanding, history of payment amounts, status of collections due, and applicable statutes of limitations.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, healthcare insurers and government payers accounted for over 42% and 61% of total revenues, respectively. Also, healthcare insurers and government payers amounted to total revenues of $12,546,849 and $11,824,717 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The accounts receivable related to both healthcare insurers and government payers is $1,499,415 and $4,129,953 as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2023, DESs Averett University project accounted for $3,741,494, or 12% of total revenues.\nAs of June 30, 2023 and 2022, $829,239 and $880,500 is owed by customers from the sale of Likido units, respectively.\n(f) Fair Value Measurements\nPursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.\nLevel 3 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe Companys financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, notes payable, and amounts due to related parties. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of cash is determined based on Level 1 inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.\nThe fair value of the contingent consideration obligations was based on a probability weighted approach derived from the estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria. The measurement was based on significant inputs that were not observable in the market, therefore, the Company classified this liability as Level 3 in the following tables:\nSchedule of fair value of assets and liabilities\nFair Value Measurements as of June 30, 2023 Using:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiabilities:\nContingent consideration - - $ 4,285,389 $ 4,285,389\n$ - $ - $ 4,285,389 $ 4,285,389\nFair Value Measurements as of June 30, 2022 Using:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiabilities:\nContingent consideration - - $ 4,870,800 $ 4,870,800\n$ - $ - $ 4,870,800 $ 4,870,800\nThe Company records a contingent consideration liability relating to stock price guarantees included in its acquisition and consulting agreements. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration is recorded using a significant observable measure and is therefore classified as a Level 3 financial instrument.\nThe fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to the Companys business combinations is valued based on a forward contract and the guaranteed equity value at settlement as defined in the acquisition agreement (see Note 4. Business Combinations and Asset Acquisition). The fair value of the contingent consideration is then calculated based on the guaranteed equity value at settlement as defined in the acquisition agreement. (See Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies).\nChanges in contingent consideration liability during the year ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, are as follows:\nSchedule of changes in contingent consideration liability\nContingent\nConsideration\nLiability\nBalance as of June 30, 2022 $ 4,870,800\nChange in fair value (585,411 )\nBalance as of June 30, 2023 $ 4,285,389\nContingent\nConsideration\nLiability\nBalance as of June 30, 2021 $ -\nInitial recognition in connection with acquisition of Deptec 5,053,000\nChange in fair value (182,200 )\nBalance as of June 30, 2022 $ 4,870,800\n(g) Convertible Instruments\nThe Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging Activities (ASC 815).\nApplicable U.S. GAAP requires companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria includes circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.\nThe Company accounts for convertible instruments (when the Company has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) as follows. The Company records, when necessary, deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in shares based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the shares.\n(h) Accounts Receivable\nAccounts receivables are derived from products and services delivered to customers and are stated at their net realizable value. Each month, the Company reviews its receivables on a customer-by-customer basis and evaluates whether an allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary based on any known or perceived collection issues. Any balances that are eventually deemed uncollectible are written off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. As of June 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company had an allowance of doubtful accounts of $2,430,615 and $119,791, respectively.\nPala and Empower have a standardized approach to estimate the amount of consideration that we expect to be entitled to for its COVID-19 testing revenue, including the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials), and patient price concessions. The Company principally estimates the allowance for credit losses by pool based on historical collection experience, the current credit worthiness of the customers, current economic conditions, expectations of future economic conditions and the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding. Adjustments to our estimated contractual allowances and implicit patient price concessions are recorded in the current period as changes in estimates.\n(i) Inventory\nInventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, inventory is comprised of raw materials purchased from suppliers, work-in-progress, and finished goods produced or purchased for resale. The Company establishes inventory reserves for estimated obsolete or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future market conditions.\n(j) Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset, as follows:\nSchedule of property and equipment, estimated useful life\nEstimated Useful Life\nComputer and office equipment\n3 - 5 years\nMachinery and equipment\n5 years\nLeasehold improvements\nShorter of lease term or useful life\nEstimated useful lives are periodically assessed to determine if changes are appropriate. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of these assets and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the Consolidated Balance Sheet and any resulting gains or losses are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the period of disposal.\n(k) Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions\nThe Company accounts for acquisitions in which it obtains control of one or more businesses as a business combination. The purchase price of the acquired businesses is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recognized as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments, in the period in which they are determined, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. If the assets acquired are not a business, the Company accounts for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, the Company recognizes the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. In addition, for transactions that are business combinations, the Company evaluates the existence of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase.\n(l) Contingent Consideration\nA Company acquisition includes contingent consideration as part of the purchase price. The fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated as of the acquisition date based on the present value of the contingent payments to be made using a weighted probability of possible payments. The unobservable inputs used in the determination of the fair value of the contingent consideration include managements assumptions about the likelihood of payment based on the established benchmarks and discount rates based on internal rate of return analysis. The fair value measurement includes inputs that are Level 3 measurement as discussed in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Should actual results increase or decrease as compared to the assumption used in our analysis, the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations will increase or decrease, up to the contracted limit, as applicable. Changes in the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration could cause a material impact and volatility in our operating results. The contingent consideration decreased by $585,411 to a balance of $4,285,389 during the year ended June 30, 2023.\n(m) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets (property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected cash flows, undiscounted, is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.\nGoodwill is tested annually at June 30 for impairment and upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances.\nThe annual goodwill impairment test allows for the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. An entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting units or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to step one of the quantitative impairment tests. If it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of a reporting unit is, more likely than not, less than its carrying value, the quantitative impairment test is required. The quantitative impairment test calculates any goodwill impairment as the difference between the carrying amount of a reporting unit and its fair value, but not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, there were quantitative factors that indicated goodwill was impaired in the amounts of $433,556 and $218,308, respectively.\nAn intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. Such an asset is identifiable when it is separable, or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights. Separable assets can be sold, transferred, licensed, etc. Examples of intangible assets include computer software, licenses, trademarks, patents, films, and copyrights. The Companys intangible assets are finite lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\n(n) Revenue Recognition\nThe Company determines revenue recognition in accordance with ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and its related amendments (collectively known as ASC 606) through the following steps:\n- Identification of a contract with a customer;\n- Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n- Determination of the transaction price;\n- Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n- Recognition of revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied.\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. As a practical expedient, the Company does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less.\nThe Companys revenue is derived from the sales of its products, which represents net sales recorded in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. Product sales are recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with the customer are satisfied. Typically, this would occur upon transfer of control, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of risk of loss related to those goods. The Company measures revenue as the amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods (transaction price). The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns, allowances, markdowns, and discounts. The Company bases its estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns, markdowns and allowances that have not yet been received by the Company. The actual amount of customer returns and allowances is inherently uncertain and may differ from the Companys estimates. If the Company determines that actual or expected returns or allowances are significantly higher or lower than the reserves it established, it will record a reduction or increase, as appropriate, to net sales in the period in which it makes such a determination. Reserves for returns and markdowns are included within accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. Allowance and discounts are recorded in accounts receivable, net and the value of inventory associated with reserves for sales returns are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company estimates warranty claims reserves based on historical results and research and determined that a warranty reserve was not necessary as of June 30, 2023, or 2022.\nNet revenues from COVID-19 testing accounted for over 34% and 61% of the Companys total net revenues for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low-dollar transactions. Pala and Empower, which provides clinical testing services and other services, satisfies its performance obligations and recognizes revenues primarily upon completion of the testing process (when results are reported) or when services have been rendered. Pala and Empower do not invoice the patients themselves for testing but relies on healthcare insurers and government payers for reimbursement for COVID-19 testing. Pala has a standardized approach to estimate the amount of consideration that we expect to be entitled to, including the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials), and patient price concessions. We regularly assess the state of our billing operations in order to identify issues which may impact the collectability of receivables or revenue estimates. We believe that the collectability of our receivables is directly linked to the quality of our billing processes, most notably those related to obtaining the correct information in order to bill effectively for the services we provide. As such, we strive to implement best practices and work with our third-party billing company to reduce the number of requisitions that we receive from healthcare providers with missing or incorrect billing information. We believe that our collection and revenue estimation processes, along with our close monitoring of our billing operations, help to reduce the risk associated with material adjustments to reserve estimates. However, changes to our estimate of the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials) and patient price concessions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition in the period that the estimates are adjusted. Adjustments to our estimated contractual allowances and implicit patient price concessions are recorded in the current period as changes in estimates. Although we have limited track record, further adjustments to the allowances, based on actual receipts, may be recorded upon settlement.\nDES recognizes revenue on energy savings contracts where it provides design, engineering and equipment upgrades to obtain energy savings through Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) targets. DES recognizes revenue through two performance obligations: 1) the Energy Savings Report (point in time); and 2) functional IP license (point in time with a significant financing component and royalty and variable consideration constraint). Up to and upon completion of an energy savings project, DES calculates the monthly energy savings based on prior and current energy consumption totals. Upon completion of a project, the customer pays monthly fixed payments which represents a financing component. DES recognized monthly interest income and royalty revenue when the constraint from the energy savings percentage is known. DES records revenue as it provides additional management, consulting, and other services as they are incurred.\nDES records a sales-type where the Company is the lessor. The Company records its investment in the plant and equipment, used to upgrade a customers real property, leased to franchisees on a net basis, which is comprised of the present value of fixed lease payments not yet received over the course of the energy savings agreements. The current and long-term portions of our net investment in sales-type leases are included in Accounts Receivable, net - related parties and Long-term receivables - related parties respectively in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unearned income is recognized as interest income over the lease term. Sales-type leases result in the recognition of gain or loss at the commencement of the lease, which is recorded to Revenues - related party in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nDepTec and Bothof recognize revenues using a cost-based input method, by which we use actual costs incurred relative to the total estimated contract costs to determine, as a percentage, progress toward contract completion. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined.\nThe Company also earns service revenue from its other subsidiaries, including information technology and consulting services via Prakat, educational programs, and courses via IHG, management services for Solas, and custom parts manufacturing for Dalrada Precision Parts. For Prakat, Solas and Dalrada Precision Parts, revenues are recognized when performance obligations have been satisfied and the services are complete. This is generally at a point of time upon written completion and client acceptance of the project or product, which represents transfer of control to the customer. For IHG, revenues are recognized over the course of a semester while services are performed.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table presents the Company's revenue disaggregated by revenue source:\nSchedule of disaggregated revenue\nYear Ended\nJune 30,\nProduct sales - third parties $ 7,324,522 $ 2,280,403\nProduct sales - related party 77,308 75,324\nService revenue - third parties 20,131,701 15,584,154\nService revenue - related party 2,205,438 1,327,732\nTotal revenue $ 29,738,969 $ 19,267,613\nAccounts Receivable and Deferred Revenue\nThe following table provides information about receivables and contract liabilities from contracts with customers:\nSchedule of receivables and contract liabilities\nYear Ended\nJune 30,\nAccounts receivable, net $ 4,453,104 $ 6,406,555\nAccounts receivable, net - related parties 752,348 41,603\nLong-term receivables 41,722 42,395\nLong-term receivables - related parties 1,173,893 1,209,103\nDeferred revenue 1,337,259 720,923\nThe Company invoices customers based upon contractual billing schedules, and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent a set-up fee prepayment received from a customer in advance of performance obligations met.\n(o) Cost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of inventory sold and related freight for product sales and direct labor for information technology and consulting services. The following table is a breakdown of cost of revenue:\nSchedule of cost of revenue\nYear Ended\nJune 30,\nProduct sales $ 5,546,015 $ 2,547,392\nService revenue 15,133,035 6,213,874\nTotal cost of revenue $ 20,679,050 $ 8,761,266\n(p) Advertising\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, advertising expenses were $292,473 and $560,777, respectively.\n(q) Stock-based Compensation\nThe Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the quoted market price of the equity instruments issued. During the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, stock-based compensation expenses were $4,022,656 and $2,772,770, respectively.\n(r) Foreign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of the Company is the United States dollar. The functional currency of the Likido, DepTec, and Dalrada Technology subsidiaries is the Great British Pound. The functional currency of Prakat is the Indian Rupee. The functional currency of Dalrada Technology Spain is the Euro. The financial statements of the Companys subsidiaries were translated to United States dollars in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Translation Matters, using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the year for revenues and expenses. Gains and losses arising on foreign currency denominated transactions are included in Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(s) Comprehensive Loss\nASC 220, Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the consolidated financial statements. During the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, the Companys only component of comprehensive loss was foreign currency translation adjustments.\n(t) Non-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests are classified as a separate component of equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity (Deficit). Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests are reflected separately from consolidated net loss in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss and Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity (Deficit). Any change in ownership of a subsidiary while the controlling financial interest is retained is accounted for as an equity transaction between the controlling and non-controlling interests. In addition, when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained non-controlling equity investment in the former subsidiary will be initially measured at fair value and the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the retained interest will be recorded as a gain or loss.\nAs of June 30, 2023, and 2022, non-controlling interests pertained to the Companys Prakat and Pala subsidiaries.\n(u) Earnings (Loss) per Share\nThe Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the periods using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the periods is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants.\nAs all potentially dilutive securities are anti-dilutive as of June 30, 2023, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share. Potentially dilutive items outstanding for the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, are as follows:\nSchedule of anti-dilutive shares\nConvertible notes payable - 2,999,148\nCommon stock warrants 45,451,134 12,025,000\nWeighted average exercise price $ 0.33 $ 0.45\nProceeds $ 15,150,695 $ 5,411,250\nAverage stock price for FY $ 0.13 $ 0.50\nShares purchased 116,543,810 10,822,500\nThe average closing price during the years exceeded the exercise prices; as a result, there was no effect during the years ended June 30, 2023, or 2022.\n(v) Income Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.\n(w) Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08 - Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2021-08). Under current accounting standards, contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination are to be recorded at fair value using the ASC 805 measurement principle. ASU 2021-08 requires the acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers as if the acquirer had originated the contracts rather than at fair value. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2021-08 on a prospective basis as of January 1, 2022. The election to use practical expedients allowed under ASU 2021-08 will be applied on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. There was no impact to the Companys consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date.\nThe Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.\n3. Investment in Pala Diagnostics\nIn August 2021, Dalrada entered a joint venture (JV) with Vivera Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Vivera) for a 51% ownership and controlling interest to operate a CLIA-certified diagnostics lab focused on SARS-CoV-2 testing. The JV has been treated as a business combination.\nThe Company determined that Pala is a Variable Interest Entity (VIE); we believe that the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Pala, and accordingly, Dalrada is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The Company has consolidated the activities of the VIE.\nPursuant to the partnership agreement, Dalrada contributed equity in the amount of $500,000 for operating capital and Vivera contributed property and equipment at a fair value of $111,185. This amount was recorded to non-controlling interest equity balance in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPursuant to the JV agreement, Dalrada issued 250,000 shares of common stock to Vivera in October 2021. The fair value of $58,560 was recorded to goodwill as of June 30, 2022. This goodwill balance was written down to $0 as of June 30, 2023.\nIn December 2021, the Company filed suit against Vivera and Paul Edalat, Viveras Chairman and CEO, for misappropriation of funds on behalf of the joint venture in the amount of $2,104,509. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for additional information related to the lawsuit with Vivera.\n4.

The Company assumed the net liabilities of Bothof in exchange for the employment services of the selling shareholder. All considerations in the transaction require the continued employment of the selling shareholder and thus is not consideration transferred under ASC 805.\nThe Company entered into a 36-month employment agreement with the selling shareholder for $30,000 monthly and additionally issued 3,000,000 cashless warrants, at a strike price of $0.15 per share, to equal $450,000, which shall vest quarterly over a period of 24 months (the Warrant Consideration).\nIf at the end of the 24-month warrant distribution period, beginning on the effective date of October 17, 2022 (the Distribution Period), the value of cashless warrants does not equate to $6,000,000 (the Target Amount) in value, then the Company shall issue additional cashless warrants equal to the shortfall between the value of the Warrants Consideration and the Target Amount (the Valuation Shortfall).\nThe value of the Warrant Consideration to the selling shareholder is $5,101,223. The Company records the value as stock-based compensation on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of 24-months:\nThe Warrant Consideration is contingent on the selling shareholders continued employment with the Company; therefore, it is treated as stock-based compensation expense and recognized ratably over a 24-month period.\nThe Company acquired Bothof to facilitate the work of and expand the Dalrada Energy Services segment. Bothofs selling shareholder holds certain licenses, construction/engineering design expertise and management skills which will leverage synergies with Dalrada Energy Services.\nThe Bothof transaction was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations.

In consideration for the asset acquisition, the Company issued 1,000,000 cashless warrants, at a strike price of $0.10 per share, which shall vest quarterly over 36 months.\nThe value of the Warrant Consideration to the selling shareholder is $68,975. The value was calculated using the Black-Scholes model. The Company recorded a liability for the warrants at the acquisition date as the warrants are not contingent on employment of the sellers:\nThe Company acquired DTL as a holding company for its European operations, including Likido Ltd. and DepTec. DTL will also be utilized to pursue certain European grants and other governmental funding opportunities.

The value of the issued stock shall be deemed at the date of issue, which is the end of the Distribution Period.\nAs a result of the Valuation Shortfall, the Company recorded contingent consideration (see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in connection with the acquisition. The following is a summary of the purchase price consideration:\nSchedule of purchase price consideration\nCommon stock to be issued $ 175,000\nContingent consideration 5,053,000\nTotal purchase price consideration $ 5,228,000\nThe Company acquired DepTec to expand its Precision Manufacturing segment into the microchip and semiconductor industries.

Under Monthly Redemption, the Company shall redeem an applicable redemption amount in accordance with the redemption schedule provided in the Debenture, which is subject to pro rata adjustment to reflect the conversion or redemption otherwise effected pursuant to the Debenture contemporaneous with or prior to the scheduled redemption date, in cash, in common stock through the Buyers conversion of the Debenture (at any time after the applicable redemption date), or a combination of both at the Companys option. With respect to each Monthly Redemption all or partially in common stock, the conversion price shall be the lower of (1) the Fixed Conversion Price, or (2) 100% of the lowest daily VWAP during the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of conversion (the Variable Conversion Price).

Commitments and Contingencies\nLease Commitments\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. This determination generally depends on whether the arrangement conveys to the Company the right to control the use of an explicitly or implicitly identified fixed asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control of an underlying asset is conveyed to the Company if the Company obtains the rights to direct the use of and to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from using the underlying asset. The Company has lease agreements which include lease and non-lease components, which the Company has elected to account for as a single lease component for all classes of underlying assets. Lease expense for variable lease components is recognized when the obligation is probable.\nOperating lease right of use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease payments are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company primarily leases buildings (real estate) which are classified as operating leases. ASC 842 requires a lessee to discount its unpaid lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. As an implicit interest rate is not readily determinable in the Company's leases, the incremental borrowing rate is used based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nThe lease term for all the Company's leases includes the non-cancellable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by either a Company option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, or an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease controlled by the lessor. Options for lease renewals have been excluded from the lease term (and lease liability) for the majority of the Company's leases as the reasonably certain threshold is not met.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are comprised of fixed payments, variable payments that depend on index or rate, and amounts probable to be payable under the exercise of the Company option to purchase the underlying asset if reasonably certain.\nVariable lease payments not dependent on a rate or index associated with the Company's leases are recognized when the event, activity, or circumstance in the lease agreement on which those payments are assessed as probable. Variable lease payments are presented as operating expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations in the same line item as expense arising from fixed lease payments. As of and during the year ended June 30, 2021, management determined that there were no variable lease costs.\nRight of Use Asset\nIn July 2022, the Company entered into a five-year lease agreement to lease a commercial building in Escondido, California.

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\nThe Companys management, with the participation of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such an evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that certain internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of June 30, 2023 due to the material weaknesses described in further detail below.\nPreviously Reported Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nAs previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, we identified material weaknesses in the Companys control environment.\nTo address our material weaknesses, we developed a remediation plan which included the implementation and enhancement of various policies, procedures, and controls. In executing our remediation plan, during Fiscal 2023, the Company hired accounting experts to address technical accounting transactions, purchase price allocations and other accounting activity. We also implemented a strict travel and reimbursement policy and enhanced our Board of Directors and Audit Committee for better oversight of our financial reporting processes.\nMaterial Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of June 30, 2023, we continue to have material weaknesses in the Companys control environment. Regarding the overall financial reporting structure of the Company, there is not currently a comprehensive and formalized financial reporting policies and procedures manual in place. The following sets forth internal control weaknesses:\n- performing reconciliations\n- preparing adequate and complete schedules across the various consolidated entities including roll forwards, revenue recognition, and allowance estimates\n- oversight of foreign entities\nThis lack of formalized processes was a contributing factor to which a number of inquiries were raised by the audit team and led to numerous post-closing entries subsequent to the commencement of our audit procedures.\nManagements remediation plan will focus on standardizing our reconciliation process including roll forwards and revenue recognition procedures. We will also revise allowance estimates based on June 30, 2023 year-end adjustments. We look to enhance the continued improvement of our policies, procedures, and internal controls over our control environment and risk assessment.\nNo Attestation Report by Independent Registered Accountant\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, has not been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm by virtue of our exemption from such requirement as a smaller reporting company.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting except as noted above.

As of June 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company had $0 and $0, accrued within accounts payable and accrued liabilities - related parties, respectively.\nThe following is a summary of revenues recorded by the Companys to related parties with common ownership:\nYear Ended\nJune 30,\nDalrada Health $ 76,912 $ 75,324\nDalrada Energy Services 45,968 1,261,774\nSolas - 56,240\nDalrada Energy Services - 6,000\nIgnite 3,718\nPrakat 25,000 -\nBothof Brothers 2,134,470 -\n$ 2,282,746 $ 1,403,056\nDirector Independence\nThe OTC Bulletin Board does not have a requirement that a majority of our Board of Directors be independent. However, with respect to the definition of independence utilized by NASDAQ, our officers and directors would be deemed to be independent.\nOur Audit Committee is comprised of our officers and directors. NASDAQ requires at least three members on the Audit Committee, each of whom must be independent. NASDAQ also requires that, if its Chief Executive Officers compensation is determined by its Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee must be comprised solely of independent directors. The Company currently does not meet either of these requirements.\nThe NASDAQ rules have both objective tests and a subjective test for determining who is an independent director. The objective tests state, for example, that a director is not considered independent if he or she is an employee of the Company or is a partner, executive officer or controlling stockholder of an entity to which the Company made, or from which the Company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed the greater of $200,000 or 5% of the recipients consolidated gross revenue for that year or a family member serves in the current fiscal year or has served at any time during the last three fiscal years as an executive officer of the Company. The subjective test states that an independent director must be a person who lacks a relationship that, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.
