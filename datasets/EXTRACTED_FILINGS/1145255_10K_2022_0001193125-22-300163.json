    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGENERAL\nHennessy Advisors, Inc. (the Company, we, us, or our) is a publicly traded investment management firm whose primary business activity is managing, servicing, and marketing a family of open-end mutual funds branded as the Hennessy Funds. We are committed to providing superior service to investors and employing a consistent and disciplined approach to investing based on a buy-and-hold philosophy that rejects the idea of market timing. Our goal is to provide products that investors can have confidence in, knowing their money is invested as promised and with their best interests in mind. Our firm was founded on these principles over 30 years ago, and the same principles guide us today.\nWe earn revenues primarily by providing investment advisory services to the Hennessy Funds and secondarily by providing shareholder services to investors in the Hennessy Funds. Investment advisory services include managing the composition of each funds portfolio (including the purchase, retention, and disposition of portfolio securities in accordance with each funds investment objectives, policies, and restrictions), monitoring each funds compliance with its investment objectives and restrictions and federal securities laws, monitoring the liquidity of each fund, reviewing each funds investment performance, overseeing the selection and continued employment of sub-advisors and monitoring such sub-advisors adherence to the funds investment objectives, policies, and restrictions, overseeing other service providers, maintaining in-house marketing and distribution departments, preparing and distributing regulatory reports, and overseeing distribution of the funds through third-party financial intermediaries. Shareholder services include maintaining a toll-free number that the current investors in the Hennessy Funds may call to ask questions about their accounts or the funds or to get help with processing exchange and redemption requests or changing account options. The fees we receive for investment advisory and shareholder services are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the Hennessy Funds. Accordingly, our total revenue increases or decreases as our average assets under management rises or falls. The percentage amount of the investment advisory fees varies from fund to fund, but the percentage amount of the shareholder service fees is consistent across all funds.\nWe have delegated the day-to-day portfolio management responsibilities to sub-advisors, subject to our oversight, for some of the Hennessy Funds. In exchange for these sub-advisory services, we pay each sub-advisor a fee out of our own assets, which is calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the sub-advised funds. Accordingly, the sub-advisory fees we pay increase or decrease as our average assets under management in our sub-advised funds increases or decreases, respectively.\nOur average assets under management for fiscal year 2022 was $3.6 billion, and our total assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2022 was $2.9 billion. Our business strategy centers on (i) organic growth through our marketing, sales, and distribution efforts and (ii) growth through strategic purchases of management-related assets.\nHISTORICAL CALENDAR YEAR TIMELINE\nIn February, we were founded as a California corporation under our previous name, Edward J.

Shares of the funds generally are available for purchase only by U.S. residents and, in certain circumstances, U.S. citizens living abroad.\nThe Hennessy Funds Family\nDomestic Equity\nMulti-Asset\nSector and Specialty\nHennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund\nHennessy Total Return Fund\nHennessy Energy Transition Fund\nHennessy Focus Fund\nHennessy Equity and Income Fund\nHennessy Midstream Fund\nHennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund\nHennessy Balanced Fund\nHennessy Gas Utility Fund\nHennessy Cornerstone Large Growth Fund\nHennessy Japan Fund\nHennessy Cornerstone Value Fund\nHennessy Japan Small Cap Fund\nHennessy Large Cap Financial Fund\nHennessy Small Cap Financial Fund\nHennessy Technology Fund\nDomestic Equity Funds\nFive of the Hennessy Funds are categorized as Domestic Equity products. Of those five funds, four utilize a quantitative investment strategy and one is actively managed, and they all employ consistent and disciplined approaches to investing. Following is a brief description of the investment objectives and principal investment strategies of the Hennessy Funds in the Domestic Equity product category:\nHennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund (Investor Class symbol HFCGX; Institutional Class symbol HICGX). The Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund seeks long-term growth of capital by investing in growth-oriented common stocks using a quantitative formula. From the investable common stocks of public companies in the S&P Capital IQ Database with market capitalizations exceeding $175 million, this fund invests in the 50 common stocks with the highest one-year price appreciation that also have price-to-sales ratios below 1.5, higher annual earnings than in the previous year, and positive stock price appreciation over the prior three-month and six-month periods.\nHennessy Focus Fund (Investor Class symbol HFCSX; Institutional Class symbol HFCIX). The Hennessy Focus Fund seeks capital appreciation through a concentrated portfolio of approximately 20 companies that the portfolio managers believe are high-quality businesses with large growth opportunities, excellent management, low tail risk, and discount valuations. This funds holdings are conviction-weighted, with the top ten positions comprising approximately 60-80% of the funds assets.\nHennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund (Investor Class symbol HFMDX; Institutional Class symbol HIMDX). The Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund seeks long-term growth of capital by investing in mid-cap growth-oriented common stocks using a quantitative formula. From the investable common stocks of public companies in the S&P Capital IQ Database with market capitalizations between $1 billion and $10 billion, this fund invests in the 30 common stocks with the highest one-year price appreciation that also have price-to-sales ratios below 1.5, higher annual earnings than in the previous year, and positive stock price appreciation over the prior three-month and six-month periods.\nHennessy Cornerstone Large Growth Fund (Investor Class symbol HFLGX; Institutional Class symbol HILGX). The Hennessy Cornerstone Large Growth Fund seeks long-term growth of capital by investing in growth-oriented common stocks of larger companies using a quantitative formula. From the investable common stocks of public companies in the S&P Capital IQ Database, this fund invests in the 50 stocks that meet the following criteria, in the specified order: (1) above-average market capitalization; (2) a price-to-cash-flow ratio less than the median of the remaining securities; (3) positive total capital; and (4) the highest one-year return on total capital.\nHennessy Cornerstone Value Fund (Investor Class symbol HFCVX; Institutional Class symbol HICVX). The Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund seeks total return, consisting of capital appreciation and current income, by investing in larger, dividend-paying common stocks using a quantitative formula. From the investable common stocks of public companies in the S&P Capital IQ Database, this fund invests in the 50 stocks with the highest dividend yield that also have above-average market capitalizations, above-average number of shares outstanding, 12-month sales that are 50% greater than the average, and above-average cash flows.\nMulti-Asset Funds\nThree of the Hennessy Funds are categorized as Multi-Asset products. Of those three funds, two utilize a quantitative investment strategy and one is actively managed. These funds follow a more conservative investment strategy focused on generating income and providing an alternative to funds containing only equity stocks. Following is a brief description of the investment objectives and principal investment strategies of the Hennessy Funds in the Multi-Asset product category:\nHennessy Total Return Fund (Investor Class symbol HDOGX). The Hennessy Total Return Fund seeks total return, consisting of capital appreciation and current income, by investing approximately 50% of its assets in the 10 highest dividend-yielding common stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (known as the Dogs of the Dow) in roughly equal dollar amounts and the remaining 50% of its assets in U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of less than one year. This fund then utilizes a borrowing strategy that allows the funds performance to approximate what it would be if the fund had an asset allocation of roughly 75% Dogs of the Dow stocks and 25% U.S. Treasury securities.\nHennessy Equity and Income Fund (Investor Class symbol HEIFX; Institutional Class symbol HEIIX). The Hennessy Equity and Income Fund seeks income and long-term capital appreciation with reduced volatility of returns by investing up to 70% of its assets in common stock, preferred stock, and equity-like instruments and its remaining assets in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities and debt instruments, including high-yield bonds.\nHennessy Balanced Fund (Investor Class symbol HBFBX). The Hennessy Balanced Fund seeks a combination of capital appreciation and current income by investing approximately 50% of its assets in roughly equal dollar amounts in the Dogs of the Dow stocks but limits exposure to market risk and volatility by investing approximately 50% of its assets in U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of less than one year.\nSector and Specialty Funds\nEight of the Hennessy Funds are categorized as Sector and Specialty products. Of those eight funds, one is designed as an index fund and the other seven are actively managed, and each focuses on a niche sector of the stock market. Following is a brief description of the investment objectives and principal investment strategies of the Hennessy Funds in the Sector and Specialty product category:\nHennessy Energy Transition Fund (Investor Class symbol HNRGX; Institutional Class symbol HNRIX). The Hennessy Energy Transition Fund seeks total return by investing in companies operating in the United States across the full spectrum of the energy supply/demand value chain, including traditional upstream, midstream, and downstream energy companies, as well as renewable energy companies and energy end users. The portfolio managers use a proprietary research and investment process that involves fundamental and quantitative analysis of various macroeconomic and commodity price and other factors to select this funds investments and determine the weighting of each investment.\nHennessy Midstream Fund (Investor Class symbol HMSFX; Institutional Class symbol HMSIX). The Hennessy Midstream Fund seeks capital appreciation through distribution growth and current income by investing in midstream energy infrastructure companies, including master limited partnerships, that own and operate assets used in the transporting, storing, gathering, processing, distributing, or marketing of natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil, refined products, coal, or electricity or that provide energy-related equipment and services. The portfolio managers combine a top-down deductive reasoning approach with a detailed bottom-up analysis of individual companies.\nHennessy Gas Utility Fund (Investor Class symbol GASFX; Institutional Class symbol HGASX). The Hennessy Gas Utility Fund seeks income and capital appreciation by investing in companies that are members of the American Gas Association (AGA) in approximately the same percentage as the percentage weighting of such company in the AGA Stock Index. The AGA Stock Index is a capitalization-weighted index that consists of all member companies of the AGA whose securities are traded on a U.S. stock exchange. The index is adjusted monthly for the percentage of natural gas assets on each companys balance sheet.\nHennessy Japan Fund (Investor Class symbol HJPNX; Institutional Class symbol HJPIX). The Hennessy Japan Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing in equity securities of Japanese companies. Using in-depth analysis and on-site research, the portfolio managers focus on stocks with a potential value gap by screening for companies that they believe have strong businesses and management and are trading at attractive prices. The portfolio managers limit the portfolio to what they consider to be their best ideas and maintain a concentrated number of holdings.\nHennessy Japan Small Cap Fund (Investor Class symbol HJPSX; Institutional Class symbol HJSIX). The Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing in equity securities of smaller Japanese companies, typically considered to be companies with market capitalizations in the bottom 20% of all publicly traded Japanese companies. Using in-depth analysis and on-site research, the portfolio managers focus on stocks with a potential value gap by screening for small-cap companies that the portfolio managers believe have strong businesses and management and are trading at attractive prices. The portfolio managers limit the portfolio to what they consider to be their best ideas and is unconstrained by its benchmarks.\nHennessy Large Cap Financial Fund (Investor Class symbol HLFNX; Institutional Class symbol HILFX). The Hennessy Large Cap Financial Fund seeks capital appreciation by investing in securities of large-cap companies principally engaged in the business of providing financial services, including information technology companies that are primarily engaged in providing products or services to financial services companies.\nHennessy Small Cap Financial Fund (Investor Class symbol HSFNX; Institutional Class symbol HISFX). The Hennessy Small Cap Financial Fund seeks capital appreciation by investing in securities of small-cap companies principally engaged in the business of providing financial services.\nHennessy Technology Fund (Investor Class symbol HTECX; Institutional Class symbol HTCIX). The Hennessy Technology Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing in securities of companies principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacturing, or distributing of products or services in the technology industry. From the investable common stocks of public companies in the S&P Capital IQ Database with market capitalizations exceeding $175 million, this fund invests in approximately 60 stocks (weighted equally by dollar amount) that the portfolio managers believe demonstrate sector-leading cash flows and profits, a history of delivering returns in excess of cost of capital, attractive relative valuations, ability to generate cash, attractive balance sheet risk profiles, and prospects for sustainable profitability.\nHistorical Investment Performance of the Hennessy Funds\nThe following table presents the average annualized returns for each Hennessy Fund and its relevant benchmark indices for the one-year, three-year, five-year, and ten-year (or since inception for Hennessy Funds that commenced operations less than ten years ago) periods ended September 30, 2022.\nReturns are presented net of all expenses borne by fund investors, but not net of fees waived or expenses borne by the Company. The past investment performance of the Hennessy Funds is not a guarantee of future performance, and all of the Hennessy Funds have experienced negative performance over various periods in the past and may do so again in the future.\nHennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund\nOne Year\nThree Years\nFive Years\nTen Years\nInstitutional Class Share -

Once we identify an attractive market segment, we select one of the following methods to initiate the new strategy:\nWe screen the appropriate universe of stocks with a set of parameters that we believe identifies stocks that will produce higher long-term returns with lower associated risk than their relative indices, and we then introduce the new investment strategy into the marketplace by opening and directly marketing a new fund;\nWe purchase the assets related to the management of an existing fund that we then manage ourselves;\nWe purchase the assets related to the management of an existing fund and then engage the existing portfolio managers or strategic firm to act as a sub-advisor to manage the fund; or\nWe purchase the assets related to the management of an existing fund and then employ the existing portfolio management team to manage the fund.\nASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, SOURCES OF REVENUES, AND 12B-1 PLANS\nWe earn revenues primarily by providing investment advisory services to the Hennessy Funds and secondarily by providing shareholder services to investors in the Hennessy Funds. The fees we receive for these services are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the Hennessy Funds. In addition, the sub-advisory fees that we pay are also calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the sub-advised Hennessy Funds. The amount of our assets under management fluctuates as a result of organic inflows (purchases of shares of the Hennessy Funds by new or existing investors), acquisition inflows, outflows (redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds by investors), and market appreciation or depreciation.\nThe following table summarizes our assets under management for the past three fiscal years:\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n(In thousands)\nBeginning assets under management\n$ 4,065,922\n$ 3,564,597\n$ 4,873,839\nAcquisition inflows\n-\n-\n-\nOrganic inflows\n656,491\n818,358\n571,195\nRedemptions\n(1,147,888 )\n(1,345,371 )\n(1,771,127 )\nMarket (depreciation) appreciation\n(678,808 )\n1,028,338\n(109,310 )\nEnding assets under management\n$ 2,895,717\n$ 4,065,922\n$ 3,564,597\nAs stated above, the amount of fees we receive for providing investment advisory and shareholder services increases or decreases as our average assets under management rises or falls.\nThe following table summarizes our sources of revenues, net of sub-advisory fees, for the past three fiscal years:\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n(In thousands)\nInvestment advisory fees\n$ 27,468\n$ 30,367\n$ 30,831\nShareholder service fees\n2,199\n2,393\n2,558\nSubtotal\n29,667\n32,760\n33,389\nSub-advisory fees\n(5,727 )\n(7,332 )\n(7,573 )\nRevenue, net of sub-advisory fees\n$ 23,940\n$ 25,428\n$ 25,816\nInvestment Advisory Agreements and Fees\nWe provide investment advisory services to the Hennessy Funds pursuant to investment advisory agreements with Hennessy Funds Trust. Our provision of investment advisory services to the Hennessy Funds is subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of Hennessy Funds Trust (the Funds Board of Trustees) and must be in accordance with the applicable Hennessy Funds investment advisory agreement, Prospectus, and\nStatement of Additional Information. The services that we provide to each Hennessy Fund pursuant to these investment advisory agreements include, among other things, the following:\nacting as portfolio manager for the fund or overseeing the sub-advisor acting as portfolio manager for the fund, which includes managing the composition of the funds portfolio (including the purchase, retention, and disposition of portfolio securities in accordance with the funds investment objectives, policies, and restrictions), seeking best execution for the funds portfolio, managing the use of soft dollars for the fund, and managing proxy voting for the fund;\nperforming a daily reconciliation of portfolio positions and cash for the fund;\nmonitoring the liquidity of the fund;\nmonitoring the funds compliance with its investment objectives and restrictions and federal securities laws;\nmaintaining a compliance program (including a code of ethics), conducting ongoing reviews of the compliance programs of the funds service providers (including any sub-advisor), including their codes of ethics, as appropriate, conducting on-site visits to the funds service providers (including any sub-advisor) as feasible, monitoring incidents of abusive trading practices, reviewing fund expense accruals, payments, and fixed expense ratios, evaluating insurance providers for fidelity bond, directors and officers and errors and omissions insurance, and cybersecurity insurance coverage, managing regulatory examination compliance and responses, conducting employee compliance training, reviewing reports provided by service providers, and maintaining books and records;\nif applicable, overseeing the selection and continued employment of the funds sub-advisor, reviewing the funds investment performance, and monitoring the sub-advisors adherence to the funds investment objectives, policies, and restrictions;\noverseeing service providers that provide accounting, administration, distribution, transfer agency, custodial, sales, marketing, public relations, audit, information technology, and legal services to the fund;\nmaintaining in-house marketing and distribution departments on behalf of the fund;\npreparing or directing the preparation of all regulatory filings for the fund, including writing and annually updating the funds prospectus and related documents;\nfor each annual report of the fund, preparing or reviewing a written summary of the funds performance during the most recent 12-month period;\nmonitoring and overseeing the accessibility of the fund on third-party financial intermediary platforms;\npaying the incentive compensation of the funds compliance officer and employing other staff such as legal, marketing, national accounts, distribution, sales, administrative, and trading oversight personnel, as well as management executives;\nproviding a quarterly compliance certification to the Funds Board of Trustees; and\npreparing or reviewing materials for the Funds Board of Trustees, presenting to or leading discussions with the Funds Board of Trustees, preparing or reviewing all meeting minutes, and arranging for training and education of the Funds Board of Trustees.\nThe investment advisory agreements also provide that we are responsible for performing any ordinary clerical and bookkeeping services needed by the Hennessy Funds that are not provided by the funds custodian, administrator, or transfer agent. The Funds Board of Trustees comprises four trustees who are not interested persons of the Hennessy Funds (the disinterested trustees) and Neil J. Hennessy, who is our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors. Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a majority of the trustees must be disinterested trustees, and the disinterested trustees must approve entering into and continuing our investment advisory agreements. The disinterested trustees also have sole responsibility for selecting and nominating other disinterested trustees.\nIn exchange for the services described above, we receive an investment advisory fee from each Hennessy Fund that is calculated as a percentage of such funds average daily net asset value. As of the end of fiscal year 2022, the percentages of each funds assets used to calculate the annual investment advisory fees payable to us are as follows:\nHennessy Fund\n(All Class Shares)\nInvestment Advisory Fee\n(as a % of fund assets)\nHennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund\n0.74 %\nHennessy Focus Fund\n0.90 %\nHennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund\n0.74 %\nHennessy Cornerstone Large Growth Fund\n0.74 %\nHennessy Cornerstone Value Fund\n0.74 %\nHennessy Total Return Fund\n0.60 %\nHennessy Equity and Income Fund\n0.80 %\nHennessy Balanced Fund\n0.60 %\nHennessy Energy Transition Fund\n1.25 %\nHennessy Midstream Fund\n1.10 %\nHennessy Gas Utility Fund\n0.40 %\nHennessy Japan Fund\n0.80 %\nHennessy Japan Small Cap Fund\n0.80 %\nHennessy Large Cap Financial Fund\n0.90 %\nHennessy Small Cap Financial Fund\n0.90 %\nHennessy Technology Fund\n0.74 %\nWe waived a portion of our fees with respect to the Hennessy Energy Transition Fund through the expiration of the funds expense limitation agreement on October 25, 2020. We continue to waive a portion of our fees with respect to the Hennessy Midstream Fund and the Hennessy Technology Fund to comply with contractual expense ratio limitations. The fee waivers are calculated daily by the Hennessy Funds accountants at U.S. Bank Global Fund Services, reviewed by management, and then charged to expense monthly as offsets to our revenues. Each waived fee is then deducted from investment advisory fee income and reduces the aggregate amount of advisory fees we receive from such fund in the subsequent month. Total fee waivers during each of fiscal year 2022 and 2021 were $0.1 million. To date, we have only waived fees based on contractual obligations, but we have the ability to waive fees at our discretion. Any decision to waive fees would apply only on a going-forward basis.\nOur investment advisory agreements must be renewed annually (except in limited circumstances) by (a) the Funds Board of Trustees or the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the applicable Hennessy Fund and (b) the vote of a majority of the disinterested trustees. If an investment advisory agreement is not renewed, it terminates automatically. There are two additional circumstances in which an investment advisory agreement terminates. First, an investment advisory agreement automatically terminates if we assign it to another advisor (assignment includes indirect assignment, which is the transfer of our common stock in sufficient quantities deemed to constitute a controlling block). Second, an investment advisory agreement may be terminated prior to its expiration upon 60 days written notice by either the applicable Hennessy Fund or us.\nSub-Advisory Agreements and Fees\nWe have delegated the day-to-day portfolio management responsibilities to sub-advisors, subject to our oversight, for some of the Hennessy Funds. In each case, the sub-advisor entity or the individuals working at the sub-advisor entity is the same entity or are the same individuals who advised the fund prior to our purchase of the assets related to the management of such fund. The provision of sub-advisory services must be in accordance with\nthe applicable Hennessy Funds sub-advisory agreement, Prospectus, and Statement of Additional Information. The services that each sub-advisor provides to the applicable Hennessy Fund pursuant to the terms of the sub-advisory agreement include, among other things, the following:\nacting as portfolio manager for the fund, which includes managing the composition of the funds portfolio (including the purchase, retention, and disposition of portfolio securities in accordance with the funds investment objectives, policies, and restrictions), seeking best execution for the funds portfolio, managing the use of soft dollars for the fund, and managing proxy voting for the fund;\nensuring that its compliance programs include policies and procedures relevant to the fund and the sub-advisors duties as a portfolio manager to the fund;\nfor each annual report of the fund, preparing a written summary of the funds performance during the most recent 12-month period; and\nproviding a quarterly certification to Funds Board of Trustees regarding trading and allocation practices, supervisory matters, the sub-advisors compliance program (including its code of ethics), compliance with the funds policies, and general firm updates.\nIn exchange for sub-advisory services, we pay sub-advisory fees to the sub-advisors out of our own assets. Sub-advisory fees are calculated as a percentage of the applicable funds average daily net asset value. The following table lists each of our sub-advised funds, the sub-advisor for such fund, and the percentage used to calculate the annual sub-advisory fees payable by us to such funds sub-advisor as of the end of fiscal year 2022:\nHennessy Fund\n(All Class Shares)\nSub-Advisor\nSub-Advisory Fee\n(As a % of Fund Assets)\nHennessy Focus Fund\nBroad Run Investment Management, LLC\n0.29%\nHennessy Equity and Income Fund\nFCI Advisors\n(fixed income allocation)\n0.27%\nThe London Company of Virginia, LLC\n(equity allocation)\n0.33%\nHennessy Japan Fund\nSPARX Asset Management Co., Ltd.\n$0-$500 million:\n0.35 %\nAbove $500 million-$1 billion:\n0.40 %\nAbove $1 billion:\n0.42 %\nHennessy Japan Small Cap Fund\nSPARX Asset Management Co., Ltd.\n$0-$500 million:\n0.35 %\nAbove $500 million-$1 billion:\n0.40 %\nAbove $1 billion:\n0.42 %\nThe sub-advisory agreements must be renewed annually in the same manner as the investment advisory agreements and are subject to the same termination provisions.\nShareholder Servicing Agreements and Fees\nPursuant to a shareholder servicing agreement with Hennessy Funds Trust, we provide shareholder services to investors in the Hennessy Funds including, among other things, maintaining a toll-free number that the current investors in the Hennessy Funds may call to ask questions about their accounts or the funds or to get help with processing exchange and redemption requests or changing account options. In exchange for these services, we receive a shareholder service fee from each Hennessy Fund of 0.10% of the average daily net assets of such funds Investor Class shares.\nThe shareholder servicing agreement must be renewed annually by the Funds Board of Trustees, including the vote of a majority of the disinterested trustees. If the shareholder servicing agreement is not renewed, it terminates automatically. In addition, the shareholder servicing agreement may be terminated prior to its expiration upon 60 days written notice by Hennessy Funds Trust or us.\n12b-1 Plans\nAll of the Hennessy Funds have adopted a 12b-1 plan. These plans are named after Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which permits a fund to adopt a plan that allows the fund to collect fees to use to make payments to third parties in connection with the distribution of fund shares. Amounts paid under a plan may be spent on any activities or expenses primarily intended to result in sale of shares of the fund, including, but not limited to (i) advertising, (ii) compensation paid to financial intermediaries, broker-dealers, and others for sales and marketing, (iii) shareholder accounting servicing, (iv) printing and mailing prospectuses to possible new investors, and (v) printing and mailing sales literature. A fund may also employ a distributor to distribute and market fund shares and then use 12b-1 fees to pay the distributor for expenses relating to telephone use, overhead, employing employees who engage in or support the distribution of the fund shares, printing prospectuses and other reports for possible new investors, advertising, and preparing and distributing sales literature.\nThe 12b-1 fee for each Hennessy Fund is 0.15% of the average daily net assets of such funds Investor Class shares.\nCUSTODIAL, DISTRIBUTION, AND BROKERAGE ARRANGEMENTS\nWe use independent third parties for custody and distribution of our assets under management.\nAll trades for the Hennessy Funds are executed by independent brokerage firms following our direction or the direction of our sub-advisors. When selecting brokers, we and our sub-advisors are required to seek best execution. Although there is no single statutory definition, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) releases and other legal guidelines make clear that this duty requires us to seek the most advantageous terms reasonably available under the circumstances for a customers account. The lowest possible commission, while important, is not the sole determinative factor. We and our sub-advisors also consider factors such as order size and market depth, availability of competing markets and liquidity, trading characteristics of the security, financial responsibility of the broker-dealer, and the brokers ability to address current market conditions.\nCurrently, we participate in soft dollar arrangements with one of our brokers. This means we receive research reports and real-time electronic research to assist us in trading and managing the Hennessy Funds. Under these soft dollar arrangements, the Hennessy Funds pay brokerage commissions for securities trades at the regular market rate, and some or all of the value of those commissions is received by us in the form of research or other services that benefit the Hennessy Funds. We believe our soft dollar arrangements comply with SEC guidance regarding soft dollars.\nLICENSE AGREEMENT\nOur ability to use the names and formulaic investment strategies of the Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund and the Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund are governed by the terms and conditions of a license agreement, dated as of April 10, 2000, with Netfolio. Under the license agreement, Netfolio granted us a perpetual, paid-up, royalty-free, exclusive license to use certain trademarks, such as Strategy Indexing, Cornerstone Growth, and Cornerstone Value, as well as the formula investment strategies used by the Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund and the Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund. All of our advertising, marketing, promotional, and other materials incorporating or referring to the trademarks are subject to the prior written approval of Netfolio, except that we do not need Netfolios prior written approval to use the trademarks in a manner that is not substantially unchanged from any prior use by Netfolio in its own business or from any prior use by us previously approved by Netfolio. We have the right to assign the license to another person or entity if the assignee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of the license agreement. There are no ongoing licensing fees associated with this license agreement, and Netfolio does not have any contractual rights to terminate the license agreement.\nBUSINESS STRATEGY\nFrom the time we launched our first mutual fund in 1996, we have consistently pursued a growth strategy centered on organic growth through our marketing, sales, and distribution efforts and growth through strategic purchases of management-related assets. The implementation of this business strategy is described below.\nSeeking to deliver strong investment performance of the Hennessy Funds\nOne of the most effective ways we can grow the assets of the Hennessy Funds is by delivering strong investment performance, which we believe should:\nresult in an increase in the value of existing assets of the Hennessy Funds;\nencourage more investors to buy shares of the Hennessy Funds and decrease the number of investors who redeem their shares and leave the Hennessy Funds; and\nmotivate current investors to invest additional money in the Hennessy Funds.\nUtilizing our branding and marketing campaign to attract assets\nWe believe we can attract investors to the Hennessy Funds by effectively marketing our consistent and disciplined approach to investing based on a buy-and-hold philosophy that rejects the idea of market timing. We offer quantitative funds, actively managed funds, and income-generating funds. We believe our quantitative funds attract investors who want to understand exactly how their investments are managed and who favor statistical analysis and empirical evidence as the basis for investment decisions. We also believe that our actively managed funds attract investors who appreciate a fundamental, hands-on investment management approach and talented portfolio managers. Finally, we believe our more conservative, income-generating funds attract investors seeking alternatives to funds invested entirely in equities.\nWe run a comprehensive and far-reaching public relations program designed to disseminate our message to a wide variety of potential investors through frequent television appearances, radio spots, feature articles, and print media mentions. We have partnered with an industry-leading public relations firm, SunStar Strategic, to proactively promote the Hennessy Funds to national financial media. This public relations program has consistently resulted in the Hennessy Funds being mentioned an average of once every two to three days in national print and broadcast media such as CNBC, Fox News, Bloomberg radio and TV, The Wall Street Journal, Kiplinger, and Barrons, among others. To facilitate our presence in the media, we utilize LiveStudio, an in-house studio providing a direct link to media broadcasts, at our office in Novato, California. We have several spokespeople who help us expand our public relations program and provide comprehensive media coverage of our products, including (i) Neil J. Hennessy, who is our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors as well as President, Chief Market Strategist, and a Portfolio Manager of the Hennessy Funds, (ii) Ryan Kelley, Chief Investment Officer and a Portfolio Manager of the Hennessy Funds, and (iii) Portfolio Managers Ben Cook, David Ellison, and Josh Wein, as well as the Portfolio Managers at our sub-advisors.\nWe maintain and regularly update a robust website and social media presence. Our core marketing efforts include targeted outreach to both current and prospective investors in the Hennessy Funds, including financial advisors and retail investors. Our content marketing includes overall market and sector-specific thought leadership, promotional investment ideas, fund updates, and commentary from our portfolio managers, as well as feature news articles and broadcast appearances. We attend select investment advisor trade shows and strategic industry-related conferences, and we seek opportunities to moderate or speak on industry-related panels. Through much of our fiscal year 2021 and the second half of our fiscal year 2020, we participated in these activities via videoconference or teleconference, as necessary.\nExpanding our distribution network to additional distribution platforms\nInvestors may purchase shares of the Hennessy Funds through third-party financial intermediaries, including fund supermarkets, national wirehouses and broker-dealers, independent and regional broker-dealers, and registered investment advisors, or directly from the Hennessy Funds.\nFund supermarkets, such as Schwab, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, and Pershing, generally offer funds of many different investment companies to investors in exchange for a services fee paid by the applicable fund or that funds investment advisor. The ability to purchase various funds in a single location is very attractive to investors, and the majority of our assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2022 was held at fund supermarkets. Additionally, we continually seek opportunities to form new relationships with financial intermediaries to make our no-load funds even more accessible to investors. We oversee distribution of the Hennessy Funds through all financial intermediaries.\nInvestors may also purchase shares of the Hennessy Funds directly through the Hennessy Funds website or by calling us or U.S. Bank Global Fund Services, the Hennessy Funds administrator.\nIncreasing our current base of financial advisors and investment professionals\nInvestment professionals generally have access to a wide variety of investment products they may recommend to their clients. A recommendation by an investment professional to a client to buy one of the Hennessy Funds may greatly influence that investor. Thus, we believe that expanding our current base of investment professionals who utilize no-load funds for their clients will help us increase our assets under management, which will in turn increase our revenues.\nSecuring participation on the platforms of national full-service firms\nWe continually strive to develop relationships with national full-service firms that permit their investment professionals to offer no-load funds to their clients as a way to increase the amount of assets that we manage, which will in turn increase our revenues.\nPursuing strategic purchases of management agreements for additional funds\nA primary component of our growth strategy is to selectively pursue strategic purchases of the assets related to the management of additional funds. We believe the regulatory burden imposed upon the fund industry, along with increased competition, has compressed the margins of smaller to mid-sized fund managers, making those managers more receptive to an asset purchase. The long-term trend toward lower fees has made it more challenging to identify accretive asset purchases, but we believe that we are well positioned to move quickly once we identify any attractive purchase targets from the large supply of potential targets.\nThrough our asset purchase strategy, we have completed 10 purchases of the assets related to the management of mutual funds over a 20-year period, integrating $4.3 billion in net assets of 30 different mutual funds into the Hennessy Funds family.\nDelivering strong, high-quality financial results.\nWe seek to maintain a strong financial position and to manage our investment advisory business to meet the highest regulatory, ethical, and business standards and to maintain continuity of service to all of the investors in the Hennessy Funds.\nCOMPETITION\nThe investment advisory industry is highly competitive, with new competitors continually entering the industry. We compete directly with numerous global and U.S. investment managers, commercial banks, savings and loans associations, brokerage and investment banking firms, broker-dealers, insurance companies, and other financial institutions that often provide investment products with similar features and objectives to those we offer. These institutions range from small boutique firms to large financial services complexes. We are considered a small investment advisory company. Many competing companies are part of larger financial services companies that conduct business in more markets and have greater marketing, financial, technical, research, and distribution resources and other capabilities than we do. Most of the larger firms offer a broader range of financial services to the same retail and institutional investors we seek to serve. These factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage, and we can give no assurance that our strategies and efforts to maintain and enhance our current investor\nrelationships, as well as to create new ones, will be successful. To grow our business, we must be able to compete effectively for assets under management. Key competitive factors include:\nthe investment performance of the Hennessy Funds;\nthe expense ratios of the Hennessy Funds;\nthe breadth of our product offerings;\nindustry rankings of the Hennessy Funds;\nthe quality of our services;\nour ability to further develop and market our brand;\nour commitment to placing the interests of investors first; and\nour general business reputation.\nIncreased competition could reduce the demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nCompetition is an important risk that our business faces and should be considered along with other risk factors that we discuss in Item 1A, Risk Factors.\nREGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\nWe are subject to an increasing number of extensive and complex federal and state laws and regulations intended to protect investors in funds and investors of registered investment advisors. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations.\nWe are registered as an investment advisor with the SEC and, therefore, must comply with the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and related SEC regulations. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to investors, transactions with investors, compliance program effectiveness, solicitation arrangements, conflicts of interest, advertising, recordkeeping and reporting, disclosure, and anti-fraud matters.\nWe manage accounts for the Hennessy Funds on a discretionary basis, meaning that we have the authority to buy and sell securities for each portfolio, select broker-dealers to execute trades, and negotiate brokerage commission rates. In connection with certain of these transactions, we receive soft dollar credits from broker-dealers that have the effect of reducing certain of our expenses. All of our soft dollar arrangements are intended to be within the safe harbor provided by Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). If our ability to use soft dollars were reduced or eliminated as a result of the implementation of statutory amendments or new regulations, our operating expenses would increase.\nThe Hennessy Funds are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which imposes additional obligations on both the Hennessy Funds and us, as the advisor to the Hennessy Funds, including detailed operational requirements. While we exercise broad discretion over the day-to-day management of the business, affairs, and investment portfolios of the Hennessy Funds, our operations are subject to oversight and management by the Funds Board of Trustees. The responsibilities of the Funds Board of Trustees include, among other things, annually approving the continuation of our investment advisory agreements and shareholder servicing agreement with the Hennessy Funds and our sub-advisory agreements with the sub-advisors to the Hennessy Funds, approving other service providers, determining the method of valuing assets, and monitoring transactions involving affiliates. The Investment Company Act of 1940 also imposes on us a fiduciary duty with respect to receiving investment advisory fees. That fiduciary duty may be enforced by the SEC, by administrative action, or through litigation initiated by investors in the Hennessy Funds pursuant to a private right of action.\nThe SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, ranging from fines and censures to the suspension of individual employees to termination of our registration as an investment advisor. A violation of applicable law or regulations could also subject us, our directors, and our employees to civil actions brought by private parties. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable SEC requirements.\nEMPLOYEES\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2022, we had 19 employees, 17 of whom were full-time employees. Our 19 employees had an average tenure of 12 years as of the end of fiscal year 2022. We focus on providing our employees competitive compensation, a friendly and flexible office environment, and fostering close-knit working relationships among our team members. Over 50% of our employees are women, and with an executive team that is 50% women and 25% minority, we believe we have created an environment in which all team members can be successful and supported.\nOur executive officers are (i) Neil J. Hennessy, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, (ii) Teresa M. Nilsen, President, Chief Operating Officer, Secretary, and a member of our Board of Directors, (iii) Kathryn R. Fahy, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, and (iv) Daniel B. Steadman, Executive Vice President and a member of our Board of Directors. In addition to our executive officers responsibilities at Hennessy Advisors, Inc., (a) Mr. Hennessy is President, Chief Market Strategist, and a Portfolio Manager of the Hennessy Funds and is a member of the Funds Board of Trustees, (b) Ms. Nilsen is an Executive Vice President and Treasurer of the Hennessy Funds, (c) Ms. Fahy is Vice President, Assistant Treasurer, and Assistant Secretary of the Hennessy Funds, and (d) Mr. Steadman is an Executive Vice President and Secretary of the Hennessy Funds.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nWe make available free of charge through a link on our website, www.hennessyadvisors.com, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. We are not including the information contained on our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe face many risks and uncertainties, many of which are inherent in the financial services industry and the investment advisory business. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating us and our common stock. Our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks we face, including those described below.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT\nVolatility in and disruption of the capital markets and changes in the economy has and may continue to significantly affect our assets under management and revenues.\nThe securities markets are inherently volatile and may be affected by factors beyond our control, including global economic conditions, industry trends, interest and inflation rate fluctuations, political factors, the imposition of economic sanctions, public health crises, natural disasters, and other factors that are difficult to predict. Because our assets under management is largely concentrated in equity products, our results are particularly susceptible to downturns in the equity markets. We derive all of our operating revenues from investment advisory fees and shareholder service fees paid to us by the Hennessy Funds. These fees are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset value of the Hennessy Funds. Accordingly, our revenues increase or decrease as our average assets under management increases or decreases, which is affected by market appreciation or depreciation and purchases and redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds. Changing market conditions could also cause an impairment to the value of our management contracts asset.\nInvestors in the Hennessy Funds can redeem their investments at any time and for any reason, including poor investment performance and volatile equity markets. A decline in our assets under management adversely affects our revenues.\nInvestors in the Hennessy Funds may redeem their investments at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Success in the investment advisory and fund business is largely dependent on investment performance, as well as investor servicing and distribution. If the Hennessy Funds perform poorly compared to the investment products offered by other investment advisory firms, we may experience a decrease in purchases of shares and an increase in redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds. Further, sharp declines in the stock market, such as those experienced during fiscal year 2022, have and may continue to cause increases in redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds. Such redemptions reduce our assets under management and adversely affect our revenues.\nOur business and operations are subject to adverse effects from market reactions to the outbreak of contagious diseases.\nThe outbreak and spread of contagious diseases such as COVID-19 has adversely impacted global commercial activity, contributed to significant volatility in global equity and debt markets, and disrupted supply chains, operations, and economic activity. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted the value and performance of the Hennessy Funds, which resulted in declines in our revenues. It also limited our ability to source and pursue potential acquisitions. Future outbreaks of contagious diseases could have similar adverse impacts on our business and financial performance.\nAdverse opinions of the Hennessy Funds by third parties, including rating agencies or industry analysts, could decrease new investments in, or accelerate redemptions from, the Hennessy Funds, which would adversely affect our revenues.\nThe Hennessy Funds are rated, ranked, and assessed by independent third parties, including rating agencies, industry analysts, distribution partners, and industry periodicals. These ratings, rankings, and assessments often influence the investment decisions of investors, but they can be affected by a number of factors that are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, a ranking agency like Morningstar may change its ranking designs and methodology, which could result in a decrease in the ratings of the Hennessy Funds without any action on our part. If the Hennessy Funds received an adverse rating, ranking, or assessment from a third party, it could result in an increase in the withdrawal of assets from the Hennessy Funds by existing investors and the inability to attract additional investments into the Hennessy Funds from existing and new investors, thereby reducing our assets under management and adversely affecting our revenues.\nThe failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may have a negative impact on the Hennessy Funds within such similar product type, irrespective of our fund performance.\nMany competitors offer similar products to the Hennessy Funds, and the failure or negative performance of competitors products could lead to a loss of confidence in the corresponding products in the Hennessy Funds lineup, irrespective of the performance of the Hennessy Funds. Any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to redemptions in the Hennessy Fund within such product type, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS MODEL AND OPERATIONS\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of the Hennessy Funds.\nFor the past several years, approximately 75% of our assets under management has been concentrated in four of our funds. During fiscal year 2022, our average assets under management was concentrated in the following four funds: (i) the Hennessy Focus Fund (27% of average assets under management); (ii) the Hennessy Japan Fund (16% of average assets under management); (iii) the Hennessy Gas Utility Fund (16% of average assets under management); and (iv) the Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund (10% of average assets under management). Consequently, our revenues followed a similar pattern of concentration: (a) the Hennessy Focus Fund (32% of total revenue); (b) the Hennessy Japan Fund (16% of total revenue); (c) the Hennessy Mid Cap 30 Fund (10% of total revenue); and (d) the Hennessy Gas Utility Fund (9% of total revenue). As a result, our operating results are particularly dependent upon the performance of a very small number funds and our ability to maintain and grow assets under management in these funds. These funds have experienced significant redemptions in recent years and may continue to do so for the future. This has reduced, and may continue to reduce, our assets under management and revenues.\nWe utilize unaffiliated sub-advisors to manage the portfolio composition of certain of the Hennessy Funds, and any matters that have an adverse impact on their businesses or any change in our relationships with our sub-advisors could lead to a reduction in assets under management, which would adversely affect our revenues.\nWe utilize unaffiliated sub-advisors to manage the portfolio composition of some of the Hennessy Funds. Although we perform due diligence on our sub-advisors, we do not manage their day-to-day business activities. Our financial condition and profitability may be adversely affected by situations that are specific to such sub-advisors, such as disruption of their operations, their exposure to disciplinary action, or reputational harm to them.\nWe periodically negotiate the terms and conditions of these sub-advisory relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or our sub-advisors. These relationships may also be terminated by us or the applicable sub-advisor upon short notice without penalty. An interruption or termination of our sub-advisory relationships could affect our ability to market our sub-advised funds and result in a reduction in assets under management, which would adversely affect our revenues.\nWe depend on key personnel to manage our business, and the loss of any key persons services, combined with our inability to identify and retain a suitable replacement for such person, could materially adversely affect us. Additionally, the cost to retain our key personnel could put pressure on our operating margins.\nOur success is largely dependent on the skills, experience, and performance of our key personnel. The business acumen, investment advisory expertise, and business relationships of our key personnel are critical elements in operating and expanding our business. Financial services professionals are in high demand, and we face significant competition for qualified employees. The loss of services of any of our key personnel for any reason, combined with our inability to identify and retain a suitable replacement for such person, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, in order to retain key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation to such individuals, resulting in additional expense.\nWe have debt and may incur additional debt, which may increase the risk of investing in us and may harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nBorrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and therefore increase the risks associated with investing in our securities.\nOn October 20, 2021, we completed a public offering of the 2026 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $40.25 million, which included the full exercise of the underwriters overallotment option. The 2026 Notes mature on December 31, 2026, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after December 31, 2023. The 2026 Notes bear interest at 4.875% per annum, payable on the last day of each calendar quarter and at maturity, beginning December 31, 2021. The 2026 Notes are direct unsecured obligations, rank equally in right of payment with any of our future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness, senior to any of our future indebtedness that expressly provides that it is subordinate to the 2026 Notes, effectively subordinate to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any future subsidiaries of ours.\nWe may incur additional debt in the future. Our indebtedness could (i) decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate or other purposes, (ii) limit our flexibility to make acquisitions, (iii) increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest, (iv) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry, and (v) increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions and financial, business, and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control.\nChanges in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our net revenues and hinder our growth.\nOur primary source of distribution of the Hennessy Funds is through a variety of third-party financial intermediaries. Our success is highly dependent on access to these various distribution channels. We cannot guarantee we will be able to retain access to these channels at similar pricing or at all. Increasing competition for these distribution channels could cause our distribution costs to rise, which could have a material adverse effect on our net income. These financial intermediaries generally can terminate their relationships with us on short notice. Mergers and other corporate transactions among distributors also may affect our relationships with financial intermediaries. Certain of the financial intermediaries upon whom we rely to distribute the Hennessy Funds also sell their own competing proprietary investment products, which could limit the distribution of our products. Investors increasingly rely on external consultants and other third parties for advice on the choice of investment manager. These consultants and third parties tend to exert a significant degree of influence over their clients choices, and they may favor one of our competitors as better meeting their particular clients needs. There is no assurance that the Hennessy Funds will be among their recommended choices in the future.\nAdditionally, particularly in the United States, certain third-party financial intermediaries have substantially reduced the number of investment funds they make available to their clients. If a material portion of the financial intermediaries with whom we do business were to substantially narrow their product offerings, it could have a significant adverse effect on our assets under management, revenues, and net income. More broadly, in both retail and institutional channels, financial intermediaries (distribution firms and consultants) are seeking to reduce the number of investment management firms with which they do business. This poses risks of additional lost business if a particular financial intermediary chooses to stop or significantly reduce its business relationship with us. Any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these financial intermediaries and the consultant community due to any of the above-described factors would impair our ability to distribute the Hennessy Funds, which in turn would have a negative effect on our assets under management, revenues, and net income.\nManagement contracts purchased by us are currently classified as an indefinite-life asset subject to impairment analysis. The impairment analysis is based on subjective criteria, and an impairment loss could be recorded.\nThe management contracts we have purchased, an $80.9 million asset on the balance sheet as of the end of fiscal year 2022, are considered an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. Management reviews the indefinite life classification of our management contracts asset each reporting period. If the management contracts asset is ever reclassified as an asset with a definite life, we would begin amortizing the management contracts over their remaining useful life. If the management contracts asset continues to be classified as an indefinite-life asset, we will continue to periodically review the carrying value to determine if any impairment has occurred. The impairment analysis is based on anticipated future cash flows, which are calculated based on assets under management. Although the management contracts asset is not currently impaired, there is always a possibility of impairment in the future, which could require us to write off all or a portion of the asset. A write-off, depending on the amount, could have operational risks and could have a significant impact on the value of our equity and our earnings per share.\nWe may be required to forego all or a portion of our fees under our investment advisory agreements with the Hennessy Funds.\nOn an annual basis, the Funds Board of Trustees must assess the reasonableness of our investment advisory fees. While the Funds Board of Trustees has found our investment advisory fees to be reasonable in the past, we cannot guarantee that it will continue to do so. Additionally, we regularly analyze the expense ratios of the Hennessy Funds and have the right to waive fees to compete with other funds with lower expense ratios (although in the past we have only waived fees based on contractual obligations). Any waiver of or reduction in fees would cause our revenues to decline and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Any fee waiver would apply only on a going-forward basis.\nThe Hennessy Japan Fund and the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund invest in the Japanese stock market in yen, which involves foreign exchange and economic uncertainties.\nThe Hennessy Japan Fund and the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund are invested in securities listed on the Japanese stock market, which exposes these funds to risks that are not typically associated with an investment in a U.S. issuer. The values of these funds fluctuate with changes in the value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Investments in Japanese securities also expose these funds to the economic uncertainties affecting Japan, which may\ndiffer from those affecting the United States. For example, the adverse effects of a pandemic may disproportionately impact Japan. Further, Japanese financial accounting standards and practices may differ, and there may be less information on Japanese companies available publicly. If these circumstances result in a reduction in the total assets of the Hennessy Japan Fund and the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund, our assets under management would be reduced, which would adversely affect our revenues.\nWe utilize quantitative investment strategies for some of the Hennessy Funds that require us to invest in specific portfolios of securities and hold these positions for a specified period of time regardless of performance.\nOur formula-driven funds adhere to quantitative investment strategies, and the portfolios of stocks held by such funds are rescreened and rebalanced at designated times in accordance with such investment strategies. Adhering to our investment strategies regardless of any adverse developments that may arise could result in substantial losses to the formula-driven Hennessy Funds if, for example, the stocks selected for a fund are experiencing financial difficulty or are out of favor with investors in a given period This could, in theory, result in relatively low performance of the formula-driven Hennessy Funds and adversely affect the net assets of such Hennessy Funds. A decrease in the net assets of the Hennessy Funds would adversely affect our revenues.\nWe pursue strategic asset purchases as part of our regular business strategy, and such acquisitions involve inherent risks that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition and potentially dilute the holdings of current shareholders.\nAs part of our regular business strategy, we pursue strategic purchases of the assets related to the management of additional funds. This strategy is accompanied by risks including, among others, the possibility of the following:\nthe potential unavailability of attractive acquisition opportunities;\na high level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources than we do;\nour inability to value potential asset purchases accurately and negotiate acceptable purchase terms;\nour inability to obtain quorum and secure enough affirmative votes to gain approval of the proposed fund reorganization from the target funds investors;\nthe loss of fund assets paid for in an asset purchase through redemptions by investors of the funds involved in the asset purchase;\nhigher than anticipated asset purchase expenses;\nour inability to successfully integrate and maintain adequate infrastructure to support business growth;\nincreasing our leverage;\nthe potential diversion of our managements time and attention;\ndilution to our shareholders if we fund an asset purchase in whole or in part with our common stock; and\nadverse effects on our earnings if purchased intangible assets become impaired.\nWhile we seek to mitigate these risks through, among other things, due diligence and indemnification provisions, these or other risk-mitigating measures that we put in place may not be sufficient to address these risks. If one or more of these risks occur, we may be unable to successfully complete a purchase of management-related assets (thereby requiring us to write off any related expenses), we may experience an impairment of our management contracts asset, we may receive negative publicity or suffer other negative impacts on our reputation, and we may not achieve the expected return on investment. Any of these results could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur investment advisory and shareholder servicing agreements can be terminated on short notice, are not freely assignable, and must be renewed annually; the loss of such agreements would reduce our revenues.\nWe generate all of our operating revenues from the investment advisory and shareholder servicing agreements with the Hennessy Funds. These agreements may be terminated without penalty on 60 days notice and may not be assigned without the consent of investors in the Hennessy Funds. In addition, they each must be renewed annually by the Funds Board of Trustees (or, in the case of our investment advisory agreements, by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the applicable Hennessy Fund), including a majority of the disinterested trustees. The termination or non-renewal of these agreements, or the renegotiation of the terms of these agreements in a manner detrimental to us, could result in a substantial reduction in revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR INDUSTRY\nInvestor behavior is influenced by short-term investment performance.\nInvestor behavior may be based on many factors, including short-term investment performance. Poor short-term performance of the Hennessy Funds, irrespective of longer-term success, could potentially lead to a decrease in purchases of shares of the Hennessy Funds and an increase in redemptions, thereby reducing our assets under management and adversely affecting our revenues.\nAssets invested through third-party financial intermediaries can be quickly redeemed, which could reduce our revenues.\nThird-party financial intermediaries are attractive to investors because of the ease of accessibility to a variety of funds, but this may cause the investments to be more sensitive to fluctuations in performance, especially in the short term. If we were unable to retain the assets of the Hennessy Funds held through financial intermediaries, our assets under management would be reduced. As a result, our revenues could decline and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition in attracting investors and retaining net assets in the Hennessy Funds.\nThe investment advisory industry is intensely competitive and new participants are continually entering the industry. We compete directly with numerous global and U.S. investment advisors, commercial banks, savings and loan associations, brokerage and investment banking firms, broker-dealers, insurance companies, and other financial institutions that often provide investment products with similar features and objectives to those we offer. These institutions range from small boutique firms to large financial services complexes. We are considered a small investment advisory company. Many competing companies are part of larger financial services companies that conduct business in more markets and have greater marketing, financial, technical, research, and distribution resources and other capabilities than we do. Most of the larger firms offer a broader range of financial services to the same retail and institutional investors that we seek to serve. If we are unable to attract investors and retain net assets in the Hennessy Funds due to increased competition, our revenues could decline and we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFor more information regarding competitive factors, see the Competition subheading in Item 1, Business.\nWe may be unable to develop or acquire new products and the development of new products may expose us to reputational harm, additional costs, or operational risk.\nOur continued financial performance may depend on our ability to react to changes in the asset management industry, respond to evolving investor demands and develop, market, and manage new investment products. Conversely, the development and introduction of new products, including the creation or acquisition of products with a focus on ESG (environmental, social, and governance) matters, requires continued innovative effort on our part and may require significant time and resources, as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial\nrisks and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting investor and market preferences, the introduction of competing products, constraints on our ability to manage growth, and compliance with regulatory and disclosure requirements. A growing number of new products also depend on data provided by third parties as analytical inputs and are subject to additional risks, including with respect to data quality, cost, availability, and provider relationships. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop or acquire new products that address the needs of investors on the timescale they require. Any failure to successfully develop or acquire new products, or effectively manage associated operational risks, could harm our reputation and expose us to additional costs, which may reduce our assets under management and adversely affect our revenues.\nMarket consolidation and industry trends could negatively impact our business.\nIn recent years, there have been several instances of industry consolidation in both the distribution and investment management areas. Further consolidation may occur in these areas in the future. The increasing size and market influence of certain distributors of our products and of certain direct competitors may have a negative impact on our ability to compete at the same levels of profitability in the future. Additionally, the market environment has increasingly led some investors to favor lower-fee, passive products. As a result, investment advisors that emphasize passive products have gained, and may continue to gain, market share from active managers like us.\nIndustry trends and market pressure to lower our investment advisory fees could reduce our profit margin.\nOur profits are highly dependent on the fees we are able to charge to the Hennessy Funds for investment advisory services. To the extent we are forced to compete on the basis of the investment advisory fees we charge to the Hennessy Funds, we may not be able to maintain our current fee structures. We have historically competed primarily on the performance of the Hennessy Funds and not on the level of our investment advisory fees relative to those of our competitors. In recent years, however, there has been a trend toward lower fees in the investment advisory industry. To maintain our fee structures in a competitive environment, we must be able to provide investors in the Hennessy Funds with investment returns and service that will adequately compensate them for investing in our funds with our current fee structures. We may not succeed in maintaining our current fee structures, and fee reductions on existing or future business could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nHigher insurance premiums and increased insurance coverage risks could increase our costs and reduce our profitability.\nWe carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate, but we cannot guarantee that our insurance policies will cover all liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed or, if covered, that such liabilities and losses will not exceed insurance coverage limits or that our insurers will remain solvent and meet their obligations. In addition, insurance premiums and required retentions have increased in recent years and may continue to do so.\nWe are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation. An adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties. Various claims may also arise against us in the ordinary course of business, such as employment-related claims. There has been increased incidence of litigation and regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years, including customer claims and class action suits alleging substantial monetary damages. Certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. As our insurance policies come up for renewal, we may need to assume higher deductibles or co-insurance liabilities, or pay higher premiums, which would increase our expenses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe depend on information technology, and any failures of or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or facilities, or those of third parties with which we do business, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could result in significant limits on our ability to conduct our operations and activities, costs, and reputational damage.\nWe use software and related technologies throughout our business and also utilize third-party vendors who use software and related technologies to provide services to us and the Hennessy Funds. We are dependent on the effectiveness of our information and cybersecurity policies, procedures, and capabilities we maintain to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them, including\ndata provided by third parties that is significant to our business. An information security incident, such as a cyber-attack involving a phishing scam, business email compromise, malware, or ransomware attack, or an internally caused incident or disruption, such as misuse or a failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt our business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential investor or competitive information. Moreover, our growing reliance on mobile and cloud technology and any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption, or loss of personal, confidential, or proprietary information or third-party data. Additionally, although we take precautions to password protect and encrypt our laptops and other mobile electronic hardware, if such hardware is stolen, misplaced, or left unattended, it may become vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use, creating a possible security risk and resulting in potentially costly actions. Furthermore, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available.\nThe financial services industry has been the subject of cyber-attacks involving the dissemination, theft, and destruction of corporate information or other assets as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by terrorist organizations and nation-state actors. Although we have implemented policies and controls to prevent and address potential data breaches, inadvertent disclosures, increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks, and cyber-related fraud, there can be no assurance that any of these measures will prove effective. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, to implement adequate preventative measures, or to address them until they are discovered. In addition, a successful cyber-attack may persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and it may take a considerable amount of time for an investigation to be completed and the severity and potential impact to be known. While such an investigation is ongoing, we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, and communication to the public, regulators, shareholders, and investors in the Hennessy Funds may be inaccurate, any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of an information security incident.\nIf any of these events were to occur, we could suffer a financial loss, a disruption of our business, liability to the Hennessy Funds and their investors, regulatory intervention, or reputational damage, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We also may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. In addition, our cybersecurity insurance may not cover all losses and damages from such events and our ability to maintain or obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future may be limited.\nFinally, cybersecurity and data privacy have become high priorities for regulators, and many jurisdictions are enacting laws and regulations in these areas. Two such laws are the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which took effect in 2020, and the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, which will take effect in 2023. Enactment of new privacy laws or regulations could, among other things, result in additional costs of compliance or litigation. In addition, while we strive to comply with the relevant laws and regulations, any failure to comply could result in regulatory investigations and penalties as well as negative publicity, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to legal risk and litigation, which could increase our expenses and reduce our profitability.\nWe are subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability, including, by way of example, investors in the Hennessy Funds, our own shareholders, our employees, or regulators. Lawsuits or investigations that we may become involved in could be very expensive and highly damaging to our reputation, even if the underlying claims are without merit.\nOur business is extensively regulated, which increases our costs of doing business, and our failure to comply with regulatory requirements may harm our financial condition.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States, particularly by the SEC. We are subject to regulation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and various other statutes. The laws to which we are subject are designed primarily to protect investors in the Hennessy Funds as opposed to our shareholders. In addition to an\nincreased number of applicable laws, the investment fund industry has undergone increased scrutiny by the SEC and state regulators in recent years, resulting in numerous enforcement actions and sweep examinations. Increased regulation has increased our costs in managing the Hennessy Funds, and we could continue to experience higher costs if new laws require us to spend more time, hire additional personnel, or buy new technology to comply effectively. Any change in law could also have a material adverse effect on us by limiting the sources of our revenues and increasing our costs. In addition to securities regulations, our business also may be materially adversely affected by other types of laws and policies.\nAny determination of a failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, or regulations could expose us or our employees to civil liability, criminal liability, or disciplinary or enforcement action, with penalties that could include the disgorgement of fees, fines, sanctions, suspensions, or censure of individual employees, or revocation or limitation of business activities or registration, and may result in monetary losses that are not covered by insurance in adequate amounts or at all, any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, if we or our employees were to fail to comply with applicable laws, rules, or regulations, or be named as a subject of an investigation or other regulatory action, the public announcement and potential publicity surrounding any such investigation or action could have an adverse effect on our reputation and our stock price and result in increased costs, even if we or our employees were found not to have violated such laws, rules, or regulations.\nChanges to U.S. or state tax laws, our failure to adequately comply with U.S. or state tax laws, or the outcome of any audits or regulatory disputes with respect to our compliance with U.S. or state tax laws could adversely affect us.\nChanges to U.S. or state tax law could be enacted in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, we are subject to potential tax audits in various jurisdictions and in such event, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess penalties or additional taxes. While we assess regularly the likely outcomes of these potential audits, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcome of a potential audit, and an audit could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur investment advisory agreements require us to adhere to the investment policies and strategies of the Hennessy Funds; any failure to comply with such requirements could result in claims, losses, or regulatory sanctions.\nOur investment advisory agreements with the Hennessy Funds contain contractual provisions that require us to comply with the investment policies and strategies of the Hennessy Funds when we provide our investment advisory services. We are also required to comply with numerous investment, asset valuation, distribution, and tax requirements under applicable law and regulations. Any allegation of a failure to adhere to these requirements could result in investor claims, reputational damage, withdrawal of assets, and potential regulatory sanctions, any of which could negatively impact our revenues and earnings. We have implemented procedures and utilize the services of experienced administrators, accountants, and lawyers to assist in satisfying these requirements, but there can be no assurance that these precautions will protect us from potential liabilities.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to fund new business initiatives, and resources may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur ability to meet our future cash needs is dependent upon our ability to generate cash. Although we have been successful in generating sufficient cash in the past, we may not be successful in the future. We may need to raise additional capital to fund new business initiatives or repay the 2026 Notes, and financing may not be available to us in sufficient amounts, on acceptable terms, or at all. Our ability to access bank financing or capital markets efficiently depends on a number of factors, including the state of credit and equity markets, interest rates, and credit spreads. If we are unable to access sufficient capital on acceptable terms, our business could be adversely impacted.\nFailure to establish adequate controls and risk management policies, as well as circumvention of established controls and policies by employees, could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain investors in the Hennessy Funds and by subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny, and reputational harm.\nOur reputation is critical to attracting and retaining investors in the Hennessy Funds. In recent years, there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud, conflicts of interest, or other misconduct by individuals in the financial services industry. We have implemented controls and risk management policies to monitor and manage risks, but we cannot be certain that such controls and policies will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks. Further, although we strive to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and emphasize the importance of doing so to our employees, there is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee were to engage in, or be accused of engaging in, illegal or suspicious activity (such as improper trading, disclosure of confidential information, or breach of fiduciary duties), we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position, and ability to maintain and grow the number of investors in the Hennessy Funds.\nThe historical performance of the Hennessy Funds should not be considered indicative of the future results of the Hennessy Funds or of any returns expected on our common stock.\nThe historical performance of the Hennessy Funds is relevant to returns on our common stock only insofar as the fees we have earned in the past and may earn in the future, which are based on average assets under management, may impact the performance of our common stock. Positive performance of the Hennessy Funds typically increases our revenues, which in turn could positively affect our business, and poor performance typically reduces our revenues, which in turn could adversely affect our business. However, the historical and potential future returns of the Hennessy Funds are not directly linked to returns on our common stock, such that positive performance of the Hennessy Funds will not necessarily result in positive returns on our common stock and poor performance of the Hennessy Funds will not necessary result in negative returns on our common stock. Moreover, the historical performance of the Hennessy Funds should not be considered indicative of the future results that should be expected from such funds.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nOwnership of a large percentage of our common stock is concentrated with a small number of shareholders, which could increase the volatility in our stock trading and significantly affect our share price and causes us to experience limited trading volume in our securities.\nWe have a limited number of shareholders, and a large percentage of our common stock is held by an even fewer number of shareholders. If our larger shareholders were to decide to liquidate their ownership positions, it could cause significant fluctuations in the share price of our common stock. Having a limited number of shareholders also causes us to experience limited trading volume in our securities.\nWe intend to pay regular dividends to our shareholders, but our ability to do so is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors.\nWe have consistently paid dividends each year since 2005, but the declaration, amount, and payment of dividends to our shareholders by us are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors takes into account general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans, our financial results and condition, any contractual, legal, and regulatory restrictions on our payment of dividends, and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant to determining whether to declare dividends and the amount of such dividends.  ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.\nOur principal executive office is located at 7250 Redwood Boulevard, Suite 200, Novato, California 94945, where we occupy approximately 13,728 square feet and have the right to use all common areas. We also lease office space in Austin, Texas, Dallas, Texas, Boston, Massachusetts, and Chapel Hill, North Carolina. We consider these arrangements to be suitable and adequate for the management and operations of our business. We do not own any real property. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nNone. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES.\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nUntil October 18, 2021, our common stock traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the stock symbol HNNA. On October 19, 2021, our common stock moved to and began trading on The Nasdaq Global Market, where it continues to trade under the stock symbol HNNA.\nWe have paid regular cash dividends to our shareholders and intend to continue to do so, although the declaration of a dividend is always subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2022, we had 127 holders of record of our common stock. In addition, there were 47 brokerage firm accounts that represent 2,055 additional individual shareholders for a total of 2,182 shareholders.\nThe equity compensation plan information required by Item 201(d) of Regulation S-K is set forth in the Equity Compensation Plan Information subheading under Item 12, Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.\nPURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY THE ISSUER AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS\nDuring fiscal year 2022, we repurchased shares underlying vested restricted stock units (RSUs) from employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations arising in connection with the vesting of RSUs. The stock repurchases are presented in the following table for the three months ended September 30, 2022:\nPeriod\nTotal Number of\nShares Purchased\nAverage Price Paid\nper Share\nTotal Number of Shares\nPurchased as Part of\nPublicly Announced\nPlans or Programs\nMaximum Number of\nShares that May Yet\nBe Purchased Under\nthe Plans or Programs (1)\nJuly 1-31, 2022\n-\n$ -\n-\n596,368\nAugust 1-31, 2022 (2)\n8,731\n9.93\n-\n1,096,368\nSeptember 1-30, 2022 (2)\n25,529\n9.15\n-\n1,096,368\nTotal\n34,260\n$ 9.35\n-\n1,096,368\n(1) We are authorized to purchase a maximum of 2,000,000 shares under our stock buyback program. We announced the stock buyback program in August 2010, and the program has no expiration date. In August 2022, the Board of Directors increased the number of shares that may be repurchased under the stock buyback program by 500,000 shares, to a total of 2,000,000 shares. We did not repurchase any shares pursuant to the stock buyback program during the three months ended September 30, 2022.\n(2) The shares that we repurchased in August and September 2022 are not subject to a maximum per plan or program because we did not repurchase them pursuant to a plan or program.  ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws, for which we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as expect, anticipate, intend, may, plan, will, should, could, would, assume, believe, estimate, predict, potential, project, continue, seek, and similar expressions, as well as statements in the future tense. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events, based on information currently available to us. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at which, or means by which, such performance or results will be achieved.\nForward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including those described in the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unforeseen developments could cause actual performance or results to differ substantially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. Management does not assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of these forward-looking statements. There is no regulation requiring an update of any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.\nOur business activities are affected by many factors, including, without limitation, redemptions by investors in the Hennessy Funds, taxes, general economic and business conditions, interest rate movements, inflation, the personal savings rate, competitive conditions, industry regulation, and fluctuations in the stock market, many of which are beyond the control of our management. Further, the business and regulatory environments in which we operate remain complex, uncertain, and subject to change. We expect that regulatory requirements and developments will cause us to incur additional administrative and compliance costs. Notwithstanding the variability in our economic and regulatory environments, we remain focused on the investment performance of the Hennessy Funds and on providing high-quality customer service to investors.\nOur business strategy centers on (i) the identification, completion, and integration of future acquisitions and (ii) organic growth, through both the retention of the fund assets we currently manage and the generation of inflows into the funds we manage. The success of our business strategy may be influenced by the factors discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors. All statements regarding our business strategy, as well as statements regarding market trends and risks and assumptions about changes in the marketplace, are forward-looking by their nature.\nOVERVIEW\nOur primary business activity is providing investment advisory services to a family of open-end mutual funds branded as the Hennessy Funds. We manage 12 of the 16 Hennessy Funds internally. For the remaining four funds, we have delegated the day-to-day portfolio management responsibilities to sub-advisors, subject to our oversight. We oversee the selection and continued employment of each sub-advisor, review each funds investment performance, and monitor each sub-advisors adherence to each applicable funds investment objectives, policies, and restrictions. In addition, we conduct ongoing reviews of the compliance programs of sub-advisors and make onsite visits to sub-advisors, as feasible. Our secondary business activity is providing shareholder services to investors in the Hennessy Funds.\nPrior to January 31, 2022, the day-to-day management of two Hennessy Funds, the Hennessy Energy Transition Fund and the Hennessy Midstream Fund, was performed by a sub-advisor, BP Capital Fund Services, LLC. Effective as of that date, we mutually agreed with BP Capital Fund Services, LLC to terminate the sub-advisory agreement for those funds.\nWe derive our operating revenues from investment advisory fees and shareholder service fees paid to us by the Hennessy Funds. These fees are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net assets of each Hennessy Fund. The percentage amount of the investment advisory fees varies by fund. The percentage amount of the shareholder service fees is consistent across all funds, but shareholder service fees are charged on Investor Class shares only. The dollar amount of the fees we receive fluctuates with changes in the average net asset value of each Hennessy Fund, which is affected by each funds investment performance, purchases and redemptions of shares, general market conditions, and the success of our marketing, sales, and public relations efforts.\nU.S. equities had negative performance for the one-year period ended September 30, 2022, with the S&P 500\u00ae Index returning -15.47% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average returning -13.40% for the period (on a total return basis). Equity prices dropped sharply during the period as investors have turned their attention to rising interest rates amid continuing inflationary concerns. Recent interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and the expectation of further rate hikes have contributed to weakness in equities. Despite weakness in economic growth, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will likely raise rates at upcoming meetings in an attempt to tame inflation. According to Bloomberg, the Consumer Price Index is expected to increase 8.0% in 2022, while real GDP is expected to advance 1.6%. While lower economic growth expectations would typically lead to talk of an easing interest rate environment, a strong labor market and volatile energy prices have contributed to stubbornly high and above average inflation levels. The Federal Reserve has indicated a resolve to do what it takes to bring inflation down, regardless of economic growth conditions.\nLong-term U.S. bonds declined meaningfully during the one-year period ended September 30, 2022, as the Federal Reserve tapered its bond-buying activity and continued to raise the Federal Funds rate. With a yield curve that is currently inverted, investor attention has focused on economic growth projections that continue to be revised downward. While the unemployment rate in the United States stood at an incredibly low 3.5% as of September 2022, economic growth expectations continue to trend lower. According to Bloomberg, consensus estimates for real GDP growth for 2022 are 1.6% and for 2023 are 0.7%. The sharp decline in equities, coupled with recent weakness in the residential real estate market, likely portends some softening in consumer spending in the months to come. For the one-year period ended September 30, 2022, 10-year U.S. Government Bond yields rose from 1.49% to 3.83%.\nThe Japanese equity market declined 28.41% (in U.S. dollar terms) for the one-year period ended September 30, 2022, as measured by the Tokyo Stock Price Index. Like many other markets, Japan has experienced elevated levels of inflation coupled with restrained trade with key trading partners. Chinas zero-COVID strategy has hampered growth in the country and adversely affected Japanese economic growth. Japanese Yen weakness versus the U.S. Dollar contributed to weak absolute dollar returns as the Tokyo Stock Price Index was only down 7.29% in local currency terms.\nAgainst this negative equity performance backdrop, only three of the 16 Hennessy Funds posted positive returns for the one-year period ended September 30, 2022. The longer-term performance numbers remain strong, with 13 of the Hennessy Funds posting positive returns for the five-year period ended September 30, 2022, and all 14 Hennessy Funds with at least 10 years of operating history posting positive returns for the 10-year period ended September 30, 2022.\nAs always, we are committed to providing superior service to investors and employing a consistent and disciplined approach to investing based on a buy-and-hold philosophy that rejects the idea of market timing. Our goal is to provide products that investors can have confidence in, knowing their money is invested as promised and with their best interests in mind. Accordingly, we continually seek new and improved ways to support investors in the Hennessy Funds, including by providing market insights, sector highlights, and other resources to help them manage their fund investments with confidence. We operate a robust and leading-edge marketing automation and customer relationship management (CRM) system, with a database of over 100,000 financial advisors in addition to retail investors. We utilize this technology both to help retain assets and drive new purchases into the Hennessy Funds. We employ a comprehensive marketing and sales program consisting of content, digital, social media, and traditional marketing initiatives and proactive meetings. In addition, our consistent annual public relations campaign has resulted in the Hennessy brand name appearing on TV, radio, print, or online media on average once every two to three days.\nWe provide service to over 145,000 fund accounts nationwide, including accounts held by investors who employ financial advisors to assist them with investing as well as accounts held by retail investors who invest directly with us. We serve approximately 12,600 financial advisors who utilize the Hennessy Funds on behalf of their clients, including nearly 800 who purchased one of our Funds for the first time during fiscal year 2022. Approximately 17% of such advisors own two or more Hennessy Funds, and nearly 400 advisors hold a position of over $500,000. While numbers have declined in recent years, we continue to focus significant efforts on financial advisors who own two or more Hennessy Funds or hold a position of over $500,000 in an effort to build and maintain brand loyalty among our top tier of advisors.\nTotal assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2022 was $2.9 billion, a decrease of $1.2 billion, or 28.8%, compared to the end of fiscal year 2021. The decrease was attributable to net outflows of the Hennessy Funds and market depreciation.\nThe following table illustrates the changes in our assets under management over the past three fiscal years:\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n(In thousands)\nBeginning assets under management\n$ 4,065,922\n$ 3,564,597\n$ 4,873,839\nAcquisition inflows\n-\n-\n-\nOrganic inflows\n656,491\n818,358\n571,195\nRedemptions\n(1,147,888 )\n(1,345,371 )\n(1,771,127 )\nMarket (depreciation) appreciation\n(678,808 )\n1,028,338\n(109,310 )\nEnding assets under management\n$ 2,895,717\n$ 4,065,922\n$ 3,564,597\nAs stated above, the fees we receive for providing investment advisory and shareholder services are based on average assets under management. The following table shows average assets under management by share class over the past three fiscal years:\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n(In thousands)\nAverage assets under management - Investor Class\n$ 2,199,250\n$ 2,394,194\n$ 2,556,875\nAverage assets under management - Institutional Class\n1,445,112\n1,595,106\n1,541,529\nTotal\n$ 3,644,362\n$ 3,989,300\n$ 4,098,404\nThe principal asset on our balance sheet, management contracts, represents the capitalized costs incurred in connection with the purchase of the assets related to the management of investment funds. As of the end of fiscal year 2022, this asset had a net balance of $80.9 million, an increase of $0.3 since the end of fiscal year 2021. The increase is related to costs associated with the definitive agreement signed with Stance Capital in August 2022. (See Note 16 in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.)\nOn October 20, 2021, we completed a public offering of the 2026 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $40.25 million, which included the full exercise of the underwriters overallotment option. The 2026 Notes mature on December 31, 2026, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after December 31, 2023. The 2026 Notes bear interest at 4.875% per annum, payable on the last day of each calendar quarter and at maturity, beginning December 31, 2021. The 2026 Notes are direct unsecured obligations, rank equally in right of payment with any of our future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness, senior to any of our future indebtedness that expressly provides that it is subordinate to the 2026 Notes, effectively subordinate to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any future subsidiaries of ours. The 2026 Notes are the principal liability on our balance sheet at $38.9 million, net of issuance costs.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth items in the statements of income as dollar amounts and as percentages of total revenue:\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\nAmounts\nPercent of\nTotal Revenue\nAmounts\nPercent of\nTotal Revenue\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nRevenue\nInvestment advisory fees\n$ 27,468\n92.6 %\n$ 30,367\n92.7 %\nShareholder service fees\n2,199\n7.4\n2,393\n7.3\nTotal revenue\n29,667\n100.0\n32,760\n100.0\nOperating expenses\nCompensation and benefits\n8,322\n28.0\n9,078\n27.7\nGeneral and administrative\n5,036\n17.0\n4,754\n14.5\nMutual fund distribution\n1.8\n1.5\nSub-advisory fees\n5,727\n19.3\n7,332\n22.4\nDepreciation\n0.7\n0.7\nTotal operating expenses\n19,828\n66.8\n21,881\n66.8\nOperating income\n9,839\n33.2\n10,879\n33.2\nInterest expense\n2,122\n7.2\n-\n-\nOther income\n(229 )\n(0.8 )\n(2 )\n(0.0 )\nIncome before income tax expense\n7,946\n26.8\n10,881\n33.2\nIncome tax expense\n1,756\n5.9\n2,979\n9.1\nNet income\n$ 6,190\n20.9 %\n$ 7,902\n24.1 %\nRevenue - Investment Advisory Fees and Shareholder Service Fees\nTotal revenue comprises investment advisory fees and shareholder service fees. Comparing fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2021, total revenue decreased by 9.4%, from $32.8 million to $29.7 million, investment advisory fees decreased by 9.5%, from $30.4 million to $27.5 million, and shareholder service fees decreased by 8.1%, from $2.4 million to $2.2 million.\nThe decrease in investment advisory fees was due to decreased average daily net assets of the Hennessy Funds. The decrease in shareholder service fees was due to a decrease in the average daily net assets held in Investor Class shares of the Hennessy Funds. Assets held in Investor Class shares of the Hennessy Funds are subject to a shareholder service fee, whereas assets held in Institutional Class shares of the Hennessy Funds are not subject to a shareholder service fee.\nWe collect investment advisory fees from each Hennessy Fund at differing annual rates. These annual rates range between 0.40% and 1.25% of average daily net assets. Average daily net assets of the Hennessy Funds for fiscal year 2022 was $3.6 billion, which represents a decrease of $0.3 billion, or 8.6%, compared to fiscal year 2021. The Hennessy Fund with the largest average daily net assets for fiscal year 2022 was the Hennessy Focus Fund, with $1.0 billion. We collect an investment advisory fee from the Hennessy Focus Fund at an annual rate of 0.90% of average daily net assets. However, we pay a sub-advisory fee at an annual rate of 0.29% to the funds sub-advisor, which reduces the net operating profit contribution of the fund to our financial operations. The Hennessy Fund with the second largest average daily net assets for fiscal year 2022 was the Hennessy Japan Fund, with $583 million. We collect an investment advisory fee from the Hennessy Japan Fund at an annual rate of 0.80% of average daily net assets. However, we pay a sub-advisory fee at an annual rate in the range of 0.35% to 0.42% (depending on asset level) to the funds sub-advisor, which reduces the net operating profit contribution of the fund to our financial operations.\nTotal assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2022 was $2.9 billion, a decrease of $1.2 billion, or 28.8%, compared to the end of fiscal year 2021. The decrease was attributable to net outflows of the Hennessy Funds and market depreciation.\nThe Hennessy Funds with the three largest amounts of net inflows were as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2022\nFund Name\nAmount\nHennessy Cornerstone Value Fund\n$ 12 million\nHennessy Japan Small Cap Fund\n$ 2 million\nHennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund\n$ 2 million\nThe Hennessy Funds with the three largest amounts of net outflows were as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2022\nFund Name\nAmount\nHennessy Japan Fund\n$ (222) million\nHennessy Focus Fund\n$ (181) million\nHennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund\n$ (31) million\nRedemptions as a percentage of assets under management decreased from an average of 2.8% per month during fiscal year 2021 to an average of 2.6% per month during fiscal year 2022.\nOperating Expenses\nComparing fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2022, total operating expenses decreased by 9.4%, from $21.9 million to $19.8 million. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to decreases in sub-advisory fee and compensation and benefits expenses, partially offset by increases in general and administrative expense and mutual fund distribution expense. As a percentage of total revenue, total operating expenses remained flat at 66.8%.\nCompensation and Benefits Expense: Comparing fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2022, compensation and benefits expense decreased by 8.3%, from $9.1 million to $8.3 million. As a percentage of total revenue, compensation and benefits expense increased 0.3 percentage points to 28.0%. The decrease in dollar value of compensation and benefits expense was due primarily to a decrease in head count and incentive-based compensation during fiscal year 2022.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense: Comparing fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2022, general and administrative expense increased by 5.9%, from $4.8 million to $5.0 million. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expense increased 2.5 percentage points to 17.0%. The increase in general and administrative expense was due to an increase in overall business travel, including conference and other industry event attendance, as we trend towards pre-pandemic travel levels.\nMutual Fund Distribution Expense: Mutual fund distribution expense consists of fees paid to various third-party financial intermediaries that offer the Hennessy Funds as potential investments to their clients. When the Hennessy Funds are purchased through one of these financial intermediaries, the intermediary typically charges an asset-based fee, which is recorded as mutual fund distribution expense on our statement of operations to the extent paid by us. When the Hennessy Funds are purchased directly, we do not incur any such expense. These fees generally increase or decrease in line with the net assets of the Hennessy Funds held through these financial intermediaries, which are affected by inflows, outflows, and fund performance. In addition, some financial intermediaries charge a minimum fee if the average daily net assets of a Hennessy Fund held by such an intermediary are less than a threshold amount. In such cases, we pay the minimum fee.\nComparing fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2022, mutual fund distribution expense increased by 10.5%, from $0.49 million to $0.54 million. As a percentage of total revenue, mutual fund distribution expense increased 0.3 percentage points to 1.8%.\nMutual fund distribution expenses are affected by many factors, including the following:\naverage daily net assets held by financial intermediaries;\nthe split of average daily net assets held by financial intermediaries in Institutional Class shares of the Hennessy Funds versus Investor Class shares of the Hennessy Funds; and\nfee minimums at various financial intermediaries.\nSub-Advisory Fees Expense: Comparing fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2022, sub-advisory fees expense decreased by 21.9%, from $7.3 million to $5.7 million. As a percentage of total revenue, sub-advisory fees expense decreased 3.1 percentage point to 19.3%. The decrease in sub-advisory fees was due to a decrease in average daily net assets of the sub-advised Hennessy Funds, with an additional decrease as a result of us no longer paying sub-advisory fees with respect to the Hennessy Energy Transition Fund and the Hennessy Midstream Fund after January 31, 2022.\nDepreciation Expense: Comparing fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2022, depreciation expense decreased by 10.8% from $0.23 million to $0.21 million due to fewer fixed asset purchases. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation expense remained flat at 0.7%.\nInterest Expense\nComparing fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2022, interest expense increased from $0 to $2.1 million. The increase in interest expense was due to our issuance of the 2026 Notes on October 20, 2021, for which we make interest payments quarterly, with the first interest payment made on December 31, 2021.\nIncome Tax Expense\nComparing fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2022, income tax expense decreased by 41.1%, from $3.0 million to $1.8 million. The decrease in income tax expense was due primarily to lower net operating income in the current period and secondarily to a lower effective income tax rate as discussed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nNet Income\nComparing fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2022, net income decreased by 21.7%, from $7.9 million to $6.2 million. The decrease in net income was primarily due to the interest expense related to the 2026 Notes in the current period.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe continually review our capital requirements to ensure that we have funding available to support our business model. Management anticipates that cash and other liquid assets on hand as of the end of fiscal year 2022 will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for one year from the issuance date of this report, as well as our longer-term capital requirements for periods beyond one year from the issuance date of this report. To the extent that liquid resources and cash provided by operations are not adequate to meet long-term capital requirements, management plans to raise additional capital by either, or both, seeking bank financing or accessing the capital markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital.\nOn October 20, 2021, we completed a public offering of our 2026 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $40.25 million, which included the full exercise of the underwriters overallotment option. The 2026 Notes mature on December 31, 2026, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after December 31, 2023. The 2026 Notes bear interest at 4.875% per annum, payable on the last day of each calendar quarter and at maturity, beginning December 31, 2021. The 2026 Notes are direct unsecured obligations, rank equally in right of payment with any of our future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness, senior to any of our future indebtedness that expressly provides that it is subordinate to the 2026 Notes, effectively subordinate to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any future subsidiaries of ours.\nOur total assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2022 was $2.9 billion, a decrease of $1.2 billion, or 28.8%, compared to the end of fiscal year 2021. The primary sources of our revenues, liquidity, and cash flow are our investment advisory fees and shareholder service fees, which are based on, and generated by, our average assets under management. Our average assets under management for fiscal year 2022 was $3.6 billion. As of the end of fiscal year 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $58.5 million.\nThe following table summarizes key financial data relating to our liquidity and use of cash:\nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(In thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$ 8,665\n$ 10,386\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(231 )\n(249 )\nNet cash provided by (used) in financing activities\n34,217\n(4,256 )\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n$ 42,651\n$ 5,881\nThe decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $1.7 million was mainly due to the interest expense related to the 2026 Notes in the current period.\nThe cash used in investing activities of $0.2 million remained the same in both periods.\nThe increase in cash provided by financing activities of $38.5 million was due to the issuance of the 2026 Notes on October 20, 2021.\nDividend Payments. We have consistently paid dividends each year since 2005. Our quarterly dividend rate remained constant during fiscal years 2022 and 2021, and our dividend payments totaled $4.1 and $4.0 million in each such fiscal year, respectively.\n2026 Notes. On October 20, 2021, we completed a public offering of our 2026 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $40.25 million, which included the full exercise of the underwriters overallotment option. The 2026 Notes bear interest at 4.875% per annum, payable on the last day of each calendar quarter and at maturity, beginning December 31, 2021. The 2026 Notes mature on December 31, 2026.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. These accounting policies, methods, and estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are based upon managements current judgments. Those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events. Certain accounting policies, methods, and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because future events affecting them may differ markedly from managements current judgment. Described below are the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding our results of operations and financial position.\nOur operating revenues consist of contractual investment advisory and shareholder service fees. We earn our investment advisory fees through portfolio management of the Hennessy Funds, and we earn our shareholder service fees by assisting investors in purchases, sales, distribution, and customer service. These fee revenues are earned and calculated daily by the Hennessy Funds accountants. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance on revenue recognition, we recognize fee revenues monthly. Our contractual agreements provide persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists with fixed and determinable fees, and the services are rendered daily. The collectability is probable as the fees are received from the Hennessy Funds in the month subsequent to the month in which the services are provided.\nThe management contracts we have purchased are considered intangible assets with an indefinite life and we account for them in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 350: Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (ASC 350). Pursuant to ASC 350, an entity first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If an entity determines that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then it must conduct an impairment analysis. We were able to forego the annual impairment analysis for fiscal year 2022 as the more-likely-than-not threshold was not met as of the end of fiscal year 2022.\nThe costs related to our purchase of the assets related to the management of investment funds are capitalized as incurred. The costs are defined as an intangible asset per the FASB standard Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. The acquisition costs include legal fees, fees for soliciting shareholder approval, and a percent of asset costs to purchase the management contracts. The amounts are included in the management contracts asset, totaling $80.9 million as of the end of fiscal year 2022.\nRECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nWe reviewed accounting pronouncements issued between November 24, 2021, the filing date of our most recent previously filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, and December 7, 2022, the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and have determined that no accounting pronouncement issued would have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or disclosures.\nThere have been no other significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during fiscal year 2022.  ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nIndex to Financial Statements:\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nBalance Sheets\nStatements of Income\nStatements of Changes in Stockholders Equity\nStatements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nof Hennessy Advisors, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Hennessy Advisors, Inc. (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Management Contract Asset - Impairment Consideration\nAs described in Note 1(f) to the financial statements, the Company has historically capitalized the cost of purchasing management contracts as intangible assets. These intangible assets are considered to have indefinite useful lives and are therefore not amortized, but rather tested at least annually for impairment. As part of this annual test, management (i) evaluates whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment exists, and/or (ii) estimates the fair value of such intangible assets and compares it to the cost of the assets to determine whether impairment has occurred. Managements estimate of the fair value of management contract assets involves subjective assumptions that include stock market returns and weighted average cost of capital.\nWe have determined that the valuation of management contract assets constitutes a critical audit matter for the following reasons: (i) it is a matter that should be communicated to the audit committee, since it involves a significant management estimate; (ii) it involves a material account balance; and (iii) it involves especially subjective auditor judgment.\nWe have addressed this critical audit matter by performing appropriate audit procedures. These procedures included (i) assessing managements evaluation of whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment exists; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of managements fair value estimate assumptions; and (iii) testing the mathematical accuracy of managements valuation model. Professionals with specialized skills and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating of the measurement of the Companys estimated fair value of the management contract assets.\n/s/ Marcum LLP\nMarcum

Financial Statements\n(1) Organization and Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies\n(a) Organization and Description of Business\nHennessy Advisors, Inc. (the Company) was founded on February 1, 1989, as a California corporation under the name Edward J. Hennessy, Incorporated. In 1990, the Company became a registered investment advisor, and on April 15, 2001, the Company changed its name to Hennessy Advisors, Inc.\nThe Companys operating activities consist primarily of providing investment advisory services to 16 open-end\nmutual funds branded as the Hennessy Funds. The Company serves as the investment advisor to all classes of the Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund, the Hennessy Focus Fund, the Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund, the Hennessy Cornerstone Large Growth Fund, the Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund, the Hennessy Total Return Fund, the Hennessy Equity and Income Fund, the Hennessy Balanced Fund, the Hennessy Energy Transition Fund, the Hennessy Midstream Fund, the Hennessy Gas Utility Fund, the Hennessy Japan Fund, the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund, the Hennessy Large Cap Financial Fund, the Hennessy Small Cap Financial Fund, and the Hennessy Technology Fund. The Company also provides shareholder services to investors in the Hennessy Funds.\nThe Companys operating revenues consist of contractual investment advisory and shareholder service fees paid to it by the Hennessy Funds. The Company earns investment advisory fees from each Hennessy Fund by, among other things:\nacting as portfolio manager for the fund or overseeing the sub-advisor\nacting as portfolio manager for the fund, which includes managing the composition of the funds portfolio (including the purchase, retention, and disposition of portfolio securities in accordance with the funds investment objectives, policies, and restrictions), seeking best execution for the funds portfolio, managing the use of soft dollars for the fund, and managing proxy voting for the fund;\nperforming a daily reconciliation of portfolio positions and cash for the fund;\nmonitoring the liquidity of the fund;\nmonitoring the funds compliance with its investment objectives and restrictions and federal securities laws;\nmaintaining a compliance program (including a code of ethics), conducting ongoing reviews of the compliance programs of the funds service providers (including any sub-advisor),\nincluding their codes of ethics, as appropriate, conducting on-site\nvisits to the funds service providers (including any sub-advisor)\nas feasible, monitoring incidents of abusive trading practices, reviewing fund expense accruals, payments, and fixed expense ratios, evaluating insurance providers for fidelity bond, directors and officers and errors and omissions insurance, and cybersecurity insurance coverage, managing regulatory examination compliance and responses, conducting employee compliance training, reviewing reports provided by service providers, and maintaining books and records;\nif applicable, overseeing the selection and continued employment of the funds sub-advisor,\nreviewing the funds investment performance, and monitoring the sub-advisors\nadherence to the funds investment objectives, policies, and restrictions;\noverseeing service providers that provide accounting, administration, distribution, transfer agency, custodial, sales\n, marketing, public relations, audit, information technology, and legal services to the fund;\nmaintaining in-house\nmarketing and distribution departments on behalf of the fund;\npreparing or directing the preparation of all regulatory filings for the fund, including writing and annually updating the funds prospectus and related documents;\nfor each annual report of the fund, preparing or reviewing a written summary of the funds performance during the most recent 12-month\nperiod;\nmonitoring and overseeing the accessibility of the fund on third-party\nfinancial intermediary platforms;\npaying the incentive compensation of the funds compliance officer and employing other staff such as legal, marketing, national accounts, distribution, sales, administrative, and trading oversight personnel, as well as management executives;\nproviding a quarterly compliance certification to the Board of Trustees of Hennessy Funds Trust (the Funds Board of Trustees); and\npreparing or reviewing materials for the Funds Board of Trustees, presenting to or leading discussions with the Funds Board of Trustees, preparing or reviewing all meeting minutes, and arranging for training and education of the Funds Board of Trustees.\nThe Company earns shareholder service fees from Investor Class shares of the Hennessy Funds by, among other things, maintaining a toll-free\nnumber that the current investors in the Hennessy Funds may call to ask questions about their accounts or the funds or to get help with processing exchange and redemption requests or changing account options. These fee revenues are earned and calculated daily by the Hennessy Funds accountants at U.S. Bank Global Fund Services and are subsequently reviewed by management. The fees are computed and billed monthly, at which time they are recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nThe Company waived a portion of its fees with respect to the Hennessy Energy Transition Fund through the expiration of the funds expense limitation agreement on October 25, 2020. The Company continues to waive a portion of its fees with respect to the Hennessy Midstream Fund and the Hennessy Technology Fund to comply with contractual expense ratio limitations. The fee waivers are calculated daily by the Hennessy Funds accountants at U.S. Bank Global Fund Services, reviewed by management, and then charged to expense monthly as offsets to the Companys revenues. Each waived fee is then deducted from investment advisory fee income and reduces the aggregate amount of advisory fees the Company receives from such fund in the subsequent month. To date, the Company has only waived fees based on contractual obligations, but the Company has the ability to waive fees at its discretion. Any decision to waive fees would apply only on a going-forward\nbasis.\nThe Companys contractual agreements for investment advisory and shareholder services prove that a contract exists with fixed and determinable fees, and the services are rendered daily. The collectability is deemed probable because the fees are received from the Hennessy Funds in the month subsequent to the month in which the services are provided.\n(b) Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible into cash.\n(c) Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance on Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments requires disclosures regarding the fair value of all financial instruments for financial statement purposes. The estimates presented in these financial statements are based on information available to management as of the end of fiscal years 2022 and 2021. Accordingly, the fair values presented in the Companys financial statements as of the end of fiscal years 2022 and 2021 may not be indicative of amounts that could be realized on disposition of the financial instruments. The fair value of receivables, accounts payable, and notes payable has been estimated at carrying value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of marketable securities and money market accounts is based on closing net asset values as reported by securities exchanges registered with the SEC.\n(d)\nInvestments\nInvestments in highly-liquid\nfinancial instruments with remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Financial instruments with remaining maturities of greater than one year are classified as long-term\ninvestments. A table of investments is included in Note 3 in this Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe Company holds investments in publicly traded mutual funds, which are accounted for as trading securities. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses of less than\n$1,000 per year were recognized in operations for fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\nDividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend\ndate. Purchases and sales of marketable securities are recorded on a trade-date\nbasis, and realized gains and losses recognized on sale are determined on a specific identification/average cost basis.\n(e) Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally between one and ten years.\n(f) Management Contracts Purchased\nThroughout its history, the Company has completed 10 purchases of the assets related to the management of 30 different mutual funds, some of which were reorganized into already existing Hennessy Funds. In accordance with FASB guidance, the Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its management contracts asset to determine if any impairment has occurred. The fair value of the management contracts asset was estimated by applying the income approach and is based on management estimates and assumptions, including third-party valuations that utilize appropriate valuation techniques. It was determined that there was no impairment as of the end of fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification 350 - Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. The Company reviews the useful life of the management contracts each reporting period to determine if they continue to have an indefinite useful life. The Company considers the management contracts asset to be an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life and no impairment as of the end of fiscal year 2022.\n(g) Income Taxes\nThe Company, under the FASB guidance on Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Tax, uses a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a companys income tax return and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The Company utilizes a two-step\napproach for evaluating uncertain tax positions. The first step, recognition, requires the Company to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step, measurement, is based on the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement.\nThe Company believes the positions taken on its tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions and they may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly, the income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. Determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgement and estimates. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an\naudit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in the income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on the Companys income tax provision, net income, and cash flows. The accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of the Companys domestic operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions. For a further discussion on taxes, refer to Note 11 in this Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and multiple state jurisdictions. The Companys U.S. federal income taxes for 2018 through 2022 remain open and subject to examination. The Company has identified 22 major state tax jurisdictions in which it is subject to income tax, which include California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin. For tax years that remain open, the below chart shows the number of such state tax jurisdictions that remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies:\nYear\nNumber of State Tax\nJurisdictions\nFor state tax jurisdictions with unfiled tax returns, the statutes of limitations remains open indefinitely.\n(h) Earnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share is determined by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, while diluted earnings per share is determined by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents, which consist of restricted stock units (RSUs).\n(i) Equity\nAmended and Restated 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan\nThe Company has adopted, and the Companys shareholders have approved, the Amended and Restated 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan), which provides for the issuance of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, performance awards, and other equity awards for the purpose of attracting and retaining executive officers, key employees, and outside directors and advisors and increasing shareholder value. The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Omnibus Plan is 50% of the number of outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, subject to adjustment by the compensation committee of the Companys Board of Directors upon the occurrence of certain events. The 50% limitation does not invalidate any awards made prior to a decrease in the number of outstanding shares, even if such awards have result or may result in shares constituting more than 50% of the outstanding shares being available for issuance under the Omnibus Plan. Shares available under the Omnibus Plan that are not awarded in one particular year may be awarded in subsequent years.\nThe compensation committee of the Companys Board of Directors has the authority to determine the awards granted under the Omnibus Plan, including among other things, the individuals who receive the awards, the times when they receive them, vesting schedules, performance goals, whether an option is an incentive or nonqualified option, and the number of shares to be subject to each award. However, no participant may receive options or stock appreciation rights under the Omnibus Plan for an aggregate of more than 75,000 shares in any calendar year. The exercise price and term of each option or stock appreciation right is fixed by the compensation committee except that the exercise price for each stock option that is intended to qualify as an incentive stock option must be at least equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and the term of the option cannot exceed 10 years. In the case of an incentive stock option granted to a\n10% or more shareholder, the exercise price must be at least 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant and cannot exceed five years. Incentive stock options may be granted only within 10 years from the date of shareholder approval of the Omnibus Plan (which was March 2014). The aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the option is granted) of shares with respect to which incentive stock options may be granted to any one individual, which stock options are exercisable for the first time during any calendar year, may not exceed $100,000. An optionee may, with the consent of the compensation committee, elect to pay for the shares to be received upon exercise of his or her options in cash, shares of common stock, or any combination thereof.\nUnder the Omnibus Plan, participants may be granted RSUs, each of which represents an unfunded, unsecured right to receive a share of the Companys common stock on the date specified in the recipients award. The Company issues new shares of its common stock when it is required to deliver shares to an RSU recipient. The RSUs granted under the Omnibus Plan vest over four years at a rate of 25% per year. The Company recognizes stock-based\ncompensation expense on a straight-line\nbasis over the four-year vesting term of each award.\nAll compensation costs related to RSUs vested during fiscal years 2022 and 2021 have been recognized in the financial statements.\nThe Company has available up to 3,785,871\nshares of the Companys common stock in respect of granted stock awards, in accordance with terms of the Omnibus Plan.\nA summary of RSU activity is as follows:\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\nSeptember 30, 2019 and 2018\nShares\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date Fair\nValue per Share\nShares\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date Fair\nValue per Share\nNon-vested\nbalance at beginning of year\n323,810\n$ 8.87\n322,181\n$ 9.76\nGranted\n132,875\n7.72\n134,625\n8.64\nVested (1)\n(133,207 )\n(9.42 )\n(132,996 )\n(10.81 )\nForfeited\n(7,917 )\n(8.76 )\n-\n-\nNon-vested\nbalance at end of year\n315,561\n$ 8.15\n323,810\n$ 8.87\n(1)\nRepresents partially vested RSUs for which the Company already has recognized the associated compensation expense but has not yet issued to employees the related shares of common stock.\nAdditional information related to RSUs is as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2022\n(In thousands, except years)\nTotal expected compensation expense related to RSUs\n$ 18,143\nRecognized compensation expense related to RSUs\n(15,570 )\nUnrecognized compensation expense related to RSUS\n$ 2,573\nWeighted average remaining period to expense for RSUs\n3.0\nDividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan\nIn January 2021, the Company adopted an updated Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the DRSPP), replacing the previous Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan that had been in place since 2018. The DRSPP provides shareholders and new investors with a convenient and economical means of purchasing shares of the Companys\ncommon stock and reinvesting cash dividends paid on the Companys common stock. Under the DRSPP and its predecessor plan, the Company issued\n7,612 and\n12,666 shares of common stock in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the DRSPP is\n1,470,000, of which\n1,452,845 shares remained available for issuance as of September 30,\n2022.\nStock Buyback Program\nIn August 2010, the Companys Board of Directors adopted a stock buyback program pursuant to which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to 1,500,000 shares of its common stock in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. The program does not have an expiration date. In August 2022, the Board of Directors increased the number of shares that may be repurchased under the program to 2,000,000 shares. As a result, a total of 1,096,368 shares remains available for repurchase under the stock buyback program. The Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock pursuant to the stock buyback program during fiscal year 2022.\n(j) Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates.\n(2)\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company applies Accounting Standards Codification 820 - Fair Value Measurement for all financial assets and liabilities, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It also establishes a fair value hierarchy consisting of the following three levels that prioritize the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that an entity has the ability to access at the measurement date;\nLevel 2 - Other significant observable inputs (including, but not limited to, quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets or liabilities, and model-derived\nvaluations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets); and\nLevel 3 - Significant unobservable inputs (including the entitys own assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability based on the best available information) when observable inputs are not available.\nBased on the definitions, the following table represents the Companys assets categorized in the Level 1 to Level 3 hierarchies:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\n(In thousands)\nMoney market fund deposits\n$ 54,225\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 54,225\nMutual fund investments\n-\n-\nTotal\n$ 54,234\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 54,234\nAmounts included in\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 54,225\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 54,225\nInvestments in marketable securities\n-\n-\nTotal\n$ 54,234\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 54,234\nSeptember 30, 2021\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\n(In thousands)\nMoney market fund deposits\n$ 11,554\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 11,554\nMutual fund investments\n-\n-\nTotal\n$ 11,564\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 11,564\nAmounts included in\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 11,554\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 11,554\nInvestments in marketable securities\n-\n-\nTotal\n$ 11,564\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 11,564\nThere were no transfers between levels during fiscal years 2022 or 2021.\nThe fair values of receivables, payables, and accrued liabilities approximate their book values given the short-term nature of those instruments.\nThe fair value of the 2026 Notes (see Note 9 in this Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) was approximately $\n37.3\nmillion as of September 30, 2022, based on the last trading price of the notes on that date (Level 1).\n(3)\nInvestments\nThe cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses, and fair market value of the Companys trading investments were as follows:\nCost\nGross\nUnrealized\nGains\nGross\nUnrealized\nLosses\nTotal\n(In thousands)\nMutual fund investments\n$\n$\n$ (19 )\n$\nTotal\n(19 )\nMutual fund investments\n$\n$\n$ (18 )\n$\nTotal\n(18 )\nThe mutual fund investments are included as a separate line item in current assets on the Companys balance sheets.\n(4)\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nThe following table summarizes the Companys property and equipment balances:\nSeptember 30,\n(In thousands)\nEquipment\n$\n$\nLeasehold improvements\nFurniture and fixtures\nIT infrastructure\nSoftware\n1,039\nProperty and equipment, gross\n2,377\n2,161\nAccumulated depreciation\n(2,057 )\n(1,850 )\nProperty and equipment, net\n$\n$\nDuring each of fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2021, depreciation expense was $0.2\nmillion.\n(5)\nManagement Contracts\nThe costs related to the Companys purchase of the assets related to management contracts are capitalized as incurred and comprise the management contracts asset. This asset was $80.9 million as of the end of fiscal year 2022, an\nincrease of\n$0.3 million from the end of fiscal year 2021. The increase was related to expenses incurred in connection with the definitive agreement signed with Stance Capital in August 2022. The Company considers the management contracts asset to be an intangible asset per Accounting Standards Codification 350 - Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. The purchase costs that comprise the management contracts asset include legal fees, shareholder vote fees, and percent of asset costs to purchase the assets related to the management\ncontracts.\n(6)\nInvestment Advisory Agreements\nThe\nCompany has investment advisory agreements with Hennessy Funds Trust under which it provides investment advisory services to\nall classes of the\n16 Hennessy\nFunds.\nThe investment advisory agreements must be renewed annually (except in limited circumstances) by (a) the Funds Board of\nTrustees or the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the applicable Hennessy Fund and (b) the vote of a majority of the trustees of Hennessy Funds Trust who are not interested persons of the Hennessy Funds. If an investment advisory agreement is not renewed, it terminates automatically. There are two additional circumstances in which an investment advisory agreement terminates. First, an investment advisory agreement automatically terminates if the Company assigns it to another advisor (assignment includes indirect assignment, which is the transfer of the Companys common stock in sufficient quantities deemed to constitute a controlling block). Second, an investment advisory agreement may be terminated prior to its expiration upon 60 days written notice by either the applicable Hennessy Fund or the Company.\nAs provided in each investment advisory agreement, the Company receives investment advisory fees monthly based on a percentage of the applicable funds average daily net asset value.\nThe Company has entered into sub-advisory\nagreements for the Hennessy Focus Fund, the Hennessy Equity and Income Fund, the Hennessy Japan Fund, and the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund. Under each of these sub-advisory\nagreements, the sub-advisor\nis responsible for the investment and reinvestments of the assets of the applicable Hennessy Fund in accordance with the terms of such agreement and the applicable Hennessy Funds Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information. The sub-advisors\nare subject to the direction, supervision, and control of the Company and the Funds Board of Trustees. The sub-advisory\nagreements must be renewed annually (except in limited circumstances) in the same manner as, and are subject to the same termination provisions as, the investment advisory agreements.\nIn exchange for the sub-advisory\nservices, the Company (not the Hennessy Funds) pays sub-advisory\nfees to the sub-advisors\nout of its own assets. Sub-advisory\nfees are calculated as a percentage of the applicable sub-advised\nfunds average daily net asset value.\nEffective January 31, 2022, the Company and BP Capital Fund Services, LLC mutually agreed to terminate the sub-advisory\nagreement for the Hennessy Energy Transition Fund and the Hennessy Midstream Fund. Those funds are now managed internally by the Company.\n(7)\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is an operating lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease\nright-of-use\nassets and current and\nlong-term\noperating lease liabilities on the Companys balance sheet. During the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the Company renewed the lease for its office in Novato, California for an additional three years, which created a\nlong-term\noperating lease as of such date. Upon renewal of the lease, the Company recorded a\nright-of-use\nasset of $1.1 million on its balance sheet. The renewed lease expires on July 31, 2024. There were no other\nlong-term\noperating leases as of the end of fiscal year 2022.\nRight-of-use\nassets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease\nright-of-use\nassets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date. The Companys lease terms may include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise any such options. For its leases, the Company concluded that it is not reasonably certain that any renewal options would be exercise, and, therefore, the amounts are not recognized as part of operating lease\nright-of-use\nassets or operating lease liabilities. Leases with initial terms of 12 months or less and certain office equipment leases that are deemed insignificant are not recorded on the balance sheet and are expensed as incurred and included within rent expense under general and administrative expense. Lease expense related to operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease terms.\nThe Companys most significant leases are real estate leases of office facilities. The Company leases office space under non-cancelable\noperating leases. Its principal executive office is located in Novato, California, and it has additional offices in Austin, Texas, Dallas, Texas, Boston, Massachusetts, and Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Only the office lease in Novato, California has been capitalized because the other operating leases have terms of 12 months or less, including leases that are month-to-month\nin nature. The classification of the Companys operating lease right-of-use\nassets and operating lease liabilities and other supplemental information related to the Companys operating leases are as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2022\n(In thousands,\nexcept years\nand percentages)\nOperating lease right-of-use\nassets\n$\nCurrent operating lease liability\n$\nLong-term operating lease liability\n$\nWeighted average remaining lease term\n1.8\nWeighted average discount rate\n0.90 %\nFor fiscal\nyears 2022 and 2021, the Companys lease payments related to its\noperating lease right-of-use\nassets totaled $0.36 million and $0.43 million, respectively, and total rent expense for all offices, which is recorded under general and administrative expense in the statements of income, totaled $0.49 million and $0.51 million, respectively.\nThe undiscounted cash flows for future maturities of the Companys operating lease liabilities and the reconciliation to the balance of operating lease liabilities reflected on the Companys balance sheet are as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2022\n(In thousands)\nFiscal year 2023 undiscounted cash flows\nFiscal year 2024\nTotal undiscounted cash flows\nPresent value discount\n(14 )\nTotal operating lease liabilities\n$\n(8)\nAccrued Liabilities and Accounts Payable\nDetails relating to the accrued liabilities and accounts payable reflected on the Companys balance sheet are as follows:\nSeptember 30\n(In thousands)\nAccrued bonus liabilities\n$ 2,207\n$ 2,738\nAccrued sub-advisor\nfees\nOther accrued expenses\nTotal accrued expenses\n$ 3,320\n$ 4,151\n(9) Debt Outstanding\nOn October 20, 2021, the Company completed a public offering of 4.875% notes due 2026 in the aggregate principal amount of $40,250,000 (the 2026 Notes), which included the full exercise of the underwriters overallotment option. The initial net proceeds received were approximately $38,607,000 after considering the impact of issuance costs and underwriter discounts. The 2026 Notes bear interest at 4.875% per annum, payable on the last day of each calendar quarter and at maturity, beginning December 31, 2021. The 2026 Notes mature on December 31, 2026.\nThe 2026 Notes are direct unsecured obligations, rank equally in right of payment with any of the Companys future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness, senior to any of the Companys future indebtedness that expressly provides that it is subordinate to the 2026 Notes, effectively subordinate to all of the Companys existing and future secured indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of the Companys future\nsubsidiaries.\n(10)\nCommitments and Contingencies\nOther than the operating leases discussed in Note 7 in this Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, the Company has no commitments and no significant contingencies with original terms in excess of one year.\n(11)\nRetirement Plan\nThe Company has a 401(k) retirement plan covering eligible employees. Employees are eligible to participate if they are over 21 years of age and have completed a minimum of one month of service with at least 80 hours worked in that month. The Company also made discretionary profit-sharing contributions of $0.2 million in each of the fiscal years 2022 and 2021. To be eligible for the discretionary profit-sharing contribution, an employee must be eligible to participate in the 401(k) retirement plan and must complete at least 501 hours of service during the calendar year or be employed as of the last day of the calendar year.\n(12)\nIncome Taxes\nAs of the end of each of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the Companys gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions was $0.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively. If the tax benefits of such amounts were recognized, $0.3 million and $0.5 million of such amounts, respectively, would decrease the Companys effective income tax rate. The Companys net liability for accrued interest and penalties was $0.3 million as of each of\nSeptember 30, 2022, and September 30, 2021. The Company has elected to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. During the years ended September 30, 2022, and September 30, 2021, the Company recognized approximately $0.02 million and $0.03 million in interest and penalties, respectively.\nThe Companys activity was as follows:\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n(In thousands)\nBeginning year balance\n$\n$\nDecrease related to prior year tax positions\n(255 )\n-\nIncrease related to current year tax positions\n-\n-\nSettlements\n-\n-\nLapse of statutes of limitations\n-\n-\nEnding year balance\n$\n$\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits can change due to final regulations, audit settlements, tax examinations activities, lapse of applicable statutes of limitations, and the recognition and measurement criteria under the guidance related to accounting for uncertainly in income taxes. The Company is unable to estimate what this change could be within the next 12 months, but does not believe it would be material to its financial statements.\nThe Companys income tax expense was as follows:\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n(In thousands)\nCurrent\nFederal\n$\n$ 1,545\nState\n(149 )\nTotal Current\n2,058\nDeferred\nFederal\nState\nTotal Deferred\n1,050\nTotal\n$ 1,756\n$ 2,979\nThe principal reasons for the differences from the federal statutory income tax rate and the Companys effective tax rate were as follows:\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\nFederal statutory income tax rate\n21.0%\n21.0%\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit\n3.9\n4.3\nPermanent and other differences\n0.4\n0.2\nDifference due to executive compensation\n1.0\n1.1\nTax return to provision adjustments\n(1.3)\n(0.1)\nUncertain tax position allowance\n(3.0)\n0.4\nStock-based compensation\n0.1\n1.6\nEffective income tax rate\n22.1%\n28.5%\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n(In thousands)\nDeferred tax assets\nAccrued compensation\n$\n$\nStock compensation\nState taxes\nCapital loss carryforward\nROU asset/lease liability\n(1 )\n(1 )\nGross deferred tax assets\nDisallowed capital loss\n(7 )\n(7 )\nNet deferred tax assets\nDeferred tax liabilities\nProperty and equipment\n(35 )\n(33 )\nManagement contracts\n(13,687 )\n(12,731 )\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(13,722 )\n(12,764 )\nNet deferred tax liabilities\n$ (13,488 )\n$ (12,437 )\n(13)\nEarnings per Share\nThe weighted average common shares outstanding used in the calculation of basic earnings per share and weighted average common shares outstanding, adjusted for common stock equivalents, used in the computation of diluted earnings per share were as follows:\nSeptember 30,\nWeighted average common stock outstanding, basic\n7,483,342\n7,367,948\nDilutive impact of RSUs\n74,666\n41,164\nWeighted average common stock outstanding, diluted\n7,558,008\n7,409,112\nFor\nfiscal years 2022 and 2021, the Company excluded 282 and 65,098 common stock equivalents, respectively, from the diluted earnings per share calculations because they were not dilutive. In each case, the excluded common stock equivalents consisted of\nvested RSUs.\n(14)\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company\nmaintains its cash accounts with three commercial banks that, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The amount on deposit at September\n30,\n2022, exceeded the insurance limits of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation by approximately $\n4.0 million. In addition, total cash and cash equivalents include $\n54.1 million held in the First American U.S. Government Money Market Fund that is not federally insured. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash\nequivalents.\n(15)\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards\nThe Company has reviewed accounting pronouncements issued between November 24, 2021, the filing date of its most recent previously filed Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nand December 7, 2022, the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nand has\ndetermined that no accounting pronouncement issued would have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or disclosures.\nThere have been no other significant changes to the Companys critical accounting policies and estimates during fiscal year 2022.\n(16)\nRisk and Uncertainties - COVID-19\nand Geopolitical Tensions\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global health pandemic related to the outbreak of a novel coronavirus. There is uncertainty around the duration and breadth of the COVID-19\npandemic, as well as the impact it will have on the Companys operations. As a result, the ultimate impact on the Companys business, financial condition, or operating results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nThe short and long-term implications of Russias invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict. The imposition of sanctions and counter sanctions may have an adverse effect on the economic markets generally and could impact the Companys business, financial condition, and results of operations. Because of the highly uncertain and dynamic nature of these events, the impact of Russias invasion of Ukraine on the Companys business, financial condition, or operating results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\n(17)\nPending Asset Purchase of the Stance Equity ESG Large Cap Core ETF\nOn August 29, 2022, the Company announced that it signed a definitive agreement with Stance Capital, LLC and Red Gate Advisers, LLC, among others, to purchase the assets related to the management of the Stance Equity ESG Large Cap Core ETF. The Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K\nregarding this transaction on August 30, 2022.\nUpon completion of the transaction, the assets related to the Stance Equity ESG Large Cap Core ETF will be reorganized to become a series of Hennessy Funds Trust named the Hennessy Stance ESG Large Cap ETF.\nThe transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including SEC approval of an exemptive order allowing the Hennessy Stance ESG Large Cap ETF to operate under the Portfolio Reference Basket structure licensed by the Blue Tractor Group, as well as approval by the Board of Trustees of Hennessy Funds Trust, the Board of Directors of The RBB Fund, Inc. (of which the Stance Equity ESG Large Cap Core ETF is a series), and the shareholders of the Stance Equity ESG Large Cap Core ETF.\n(18)\nSubsequent Events\nAs of December 7, 2022, the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nmanagement evaluated the existence of events occurring subsequent to the end of fiscal year 2022, and determined the following to be subsequent events:\nOn October 27, 2022, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.1375 per share paid on November 30, 2022, to shareholders of record as of November 15, 2022. The declaration and payment of dividends to holders of the Companys common stock, if any, are subject to the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors. The Companys Board of Directors will take into account such matters as general economic and business conditions, the Companys strategic plans, the Companys financial results and condition, contractual, legal, and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Company, and such other factors as the Companys Board of Directors may consider relevant. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nMANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, using the criteria set forth in 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2022, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nEVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022, were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS\nThere have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022, and that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
