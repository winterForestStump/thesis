    "content": "Item 1. Business\nCorporate Overview\nWe are currently a shell company with no meaningful assets or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an operating company. We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 13, 2012. Our current business office is located at 20 Holbeche Road, Arndell Park, NSW, Australia. Our telephone number is +61-02 9672 1899.\nWe were initially an exploration stage company under the name of Freedom Petroleum Inc. (changed to Steampunk Wizards, Inc., effective on July 2, 2015) that originally intended to engage in the exploration and development of oil and gas properties. In April 2015, after reviewing the markets with investor appetite and management's duties to its shareholders, the Company determined to discontinue its oil and gas operation. We then began exploring opportunities in the computer gaming and application industry.\nWe engaged in computer game development until October 13, 2016, when control of our company changed pursuant to a share purchase agreement and a spin-off agreement. On October 26, 2016, our corporate name was changed from Steampunk Wizards, Inc. to \"Tianci International, Inc.\" The name change was effected on November 27, 2016, in connection with the merger of us into our then subsidiary, Tianci International Inc.\nEffective April 6, 2017, we effectuated a 1-for-40 reverse stock split (the 2017 Reverse Stock Split) of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value, whereby 49,854,280 outstanding shares were exchanged for 1,246,357 shares of our common stock. Common share amounts and per share amounts in these accompanying financial statements and notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this reverse stock split.\nOn August 3, 2017, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the SPA) with Shifang Wan (the Seller), the record holder of 4,397,837 common shares, or approximately 87.00% of the issued and outstanding of Common Stock of the Company, and Chuah Su Chen and Chuah Su Mei (collectively, the Purchasers, and together with the Company and the Seller, the Parties). Pursuant to the SPA, the Seller sold to the Purchasers and the Purchasers acquired from the Sellers the Shares for a total gross purchase price of Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($350,000). The acquisition was consummated on August 15, 2017. The Purchasers used personal funds to acquire the Shares.\nEffective August 6, 2021, Tianci International, Inc., a Nevada corporation (we, us, or the Company), Chuah Su Mei, our former Chief Executive Officer, President and Director, and Silver Glory Group Limited, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement) pursuant to which Chuah Su Mei agreed to sell to Silver Glory Group Limited all 1,793,000 shares of common stock of the Company held by her (the Shares) for cash consideration of Five Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($525,000) (the Transaction). The Shares represent approximately 73.18% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company and are being sold in reliance upon an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof. The sale of the Shares consummated on August 26, 2021, and was purchased by Silver Glory Group Limited using its working capital. As a result of the Transaction, Silver Glory Group Limited holds a controlling interest in the Company and may unilaterally determine the election of the members of the Board of Directors (the Board) and other substantive matters requiring approval of the Companys stockholders.\nUpon the closing of the Transaction, on August 26, 2021, the then current directors and officers of the Company resigned from his or her positions with the Company. The resignations were not due to any dispute or disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices.\nConcurrently with such resignation, the following individuals were appointed to serve in the offices set forth next to his name until the next annual meeting of stockholders of the Company and until such directors successor is elected and qualified or until such directors earlier death, resignation or removal.\nName Office\nZhigang Pei Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Director\nShufang Gao Director\nDavid Wei Fang Director\nJack Fan Liu Independent director\nYee ManYung Independent director\nJimmy Weiyu Zhu Independent director\nNone of the directors or executive officers has a direct family relationship with any of the Companys directors or executive officers. Each officer and director will serve in his positions without compensation. The Company plans to enter into compensatory arrangements with its officers and directors in the future.\nCurrent Business\nOur principal business is to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. Based on proposed business activities, we are a blank check company. We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we have not entered into any binding agreement with any party regarding acquisition opportunities for us. We hope to continue to engage in discussions with other operating businesses affiliated with our executive officers regarding potential acquisition opportunities. There is no assurance that any nonbinding term sheet will result into a definitive purchase transaction nor can we assure you that we will be able to successfully acquire such company or any company in the near future.\nThe analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Companys officers. We have unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, we will consider the following kinds of factors:\n\u00b7 Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products;\n\u00b7 Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole;\n\u00b7 Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment;\n\u00b7 Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds from the Registrant, from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;\n\u00b7 The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced;\n\u00b7 The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and\n\u00b7 Other relevant factors.\nIn applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available acquisition opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. We may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the business to be acquired. In evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as possible given the lack of information that may be available regarding private companies, our limited personnel and financial resources.\nWe expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target businesss incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information, which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage. Our lack of funds and the lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors or others associated with the target business seeking our participation.\nThe time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us.\nAdditionally, we are in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities, which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. We are, and will continue to be, an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with, joint ventures with and acquisitions of small private and public entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination.\nHistorical Activities\n2014 Securities Sale\nIn January 2014, we were a party to a securities purchase agreement (the \"2014 SPA\") by and among ourselves, certain of our shareholders (the \"Selling Shareholders\") owning an aggregate of 27,000,000 shares (before the 2017 Reverse Stock Split) (approximately 51.7%) of our common stock (the \"Sold Stock\") and Anton Lin (\"Lin\"). Pursuant to the 2014 SPA, Lin purchased the Sold Stock for $27,000 (the \"Purchase Price\") from the Selling Shareholders in a private sale transaction (the \"Private Sale\"). The Selling Shareholders were our former sole officer and director: Thomas Hynes (\"Hynes\") and corporate secretary: Nina Bijedic (\"Bijedic\"). Pursuant to the 2014 SPA, Hynes and Bijedic submitted their resignations from all positions held with us; prior to the closing of the Private Sale, our Board of Directors appointed Lin as our sole director and Chief Executive Officer, which appointment took effect immediately following the close of the Private Sale. Following the Private Sale, a change in control occurred since Lin gained control of almost 52% of our outstanding common stock.\n2015 Share Exchange\nOn July 15, 2015, we entered into a share exchange agreement (the Exchange Agreement) with Steampunk Wizards Ltd., a company incorporated pursuant to the laws of Malta (Malta Co.), Lin, being the owner of record of 11,451,541 common shares (before the 2017 Reverse Stock Split) of the Company and the persons listed thereof (the Shareholders), being the owners of record of all of the issued share capital of Malta Co. (the Steampunk Stock). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, upon surrender by the Shareholders and the cancellation by Malta Co. of the certificates evidencing the Steampunk Stock as registered in the name of each Shareholder, and pursuant to the registration of us in the register of members maintained by Malta Co. as the new holder of the Steampunk Stock and the issuance of the certificates evidencing the aforementioned registration of the Steampunk Stock in the name of us, on August 21, 2015, we issued 4,812,209 shares (the New Shares) (before the 2017 Reverse Stock Split) (subject to adjustment for fractionalized shares as set forth below) of our common to the Shareholders (or their designees), and Lin caused 10,096,229 shares (before the 2017 Reverse Stock Split) of our common stock that he owned (the Lin Stock, together with the New Shares, the Acquisition Stock) to be transferred to the Shareholders (or their designees), which collectively represented 55% of the issued and outstanding common stock of us immediately after the Closing, in exchange for the Steampunk Stock, representing 100% of the issued share capital of Malta Co. As a result of the exchange of the Steampunk Stock for the Acquisition Stock (the Share Exchange), Malta Co. became a wholly owned subsidiary (the Subsidiary) of us and there was a change of control of us following the closing. The Shareholders of Malta Co. owned approximately 55% of our issued and outstanding common stock. There were no warrants, options or other equity instruments issued in connection with the Exchange Agreement.\nMalta Co. was incorporated in 2014 to acquire the intellectual property (IP) related to an unfinished game called Tangled Tut. Making full use of the teams experience and diverse talent set, the company built the first mobile game with 3D printable rewards embedded and the associated IP and server technology.\nThrough Malta Co, we became an independent games development and technology company that specialized in developing enchanting games and gaming technology where the real and virtual worlds blur. We launched a mobile casual game called Bungee Mummy - Challenges, designed primarily for smartphones and tablets (supporting both Android and IOS), in late August of 2015.\nOn January 29, 2016, Lin resigned from his CEO and sole director positions with Tianci, and Mr. Joshua OCock became our CEO, CFO, Secretary and Director.\n2016 Securities Sale and Spin-Off\nOn October 13, 2016, we entered into a spin-off agreement (the Spin-Off Agreement) with Malta Co. and Praefidi Holdings Limited (the Buyer), an entity organized under the laws of Malta that was owned by Brendon Grunewald. Pursuant to the Spin-Off Agreement, the Buyer received all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Malta Co. and we received $2,000 as purchase price. The Buyer became the sole equity owner of Malta Co. and we had no further interest in Malta Co.\nOn October 13, 2016, shareholders who owned in the aggregate 18,071,445 shares (the 2016 Shares) (before the 2017 Reverse Stock Split) of our common stock, representing approximately 65.1% of all our issued and outstanding common stock at the time, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the Change of Control SP) with certain purchasers listed therein pursuant to which the purchasers acquired the 2016 Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $150,000. In connection with the sale, a change in control occurred, and Mr. Joshua OCock, our former President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary and sole director, resigned from all of his director and officer positions with us.\nSimultaneously with the closing, Cuilian Cai, was appointed as a director and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Tianci.\nEffective November 7, 2016, we changed our name from Steampunk Wizards, Inc. to Tianci International, Inc.\nOn January 4, 2017, we issued 19,532,820 shares of our common stock (before the 2017 Reverse Stock Split) to certain purchasers in accordance with the terms and conditions of a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Private Placement SPA), at price of $0.005 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $98,104. The shares sold in the private placement were issued in reliance on an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof. The proceeds were used for working capital purposes.\n2017 Securities Sale and Change in Control\nOn August 3, 2017, Tianci, ShiFang Wan (SFW), Chuah Su Mei, and Chuah Su Chen executed a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement), pursuant to which SFW sold to the Chuah Su Chen and Chuah Su Mei an aggregate of 4,397,837 shares of Common Stock, or approximately 87% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock, at a purchase price of $350,000. The acquisition consummated on August 15, 2017, and 2,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock were purchased by Chuah Su Chen using her own personal funds. Upon consummation, the former sole executive officer and director of Tianci resigned from all of her positions with Tianci, and Chuah Su Mei, Chuah Su Chen and Yeow Yuen Kai were appointed to serve in the positions set forth next to their names below:\nName Position\nChuah Su Chen Director, Secretary and Chief Financial Officer\nChuah Su Mei Director, Chief Executive Officer and President\nYeow Yuen Kai Director and Chief Technology Officer\nChuah Su Chen and Chuah Su Mei are siblings.\nEffective August 30, 2017, Jerry Ooi was appointed to serve as a Director of Tianci until his successor(s) shall be duly elected or appointed, unless he resigns, is removed from office or is otherwise disqualified from serving as a director of Tianci. Mr. Kai resigned from his position as the Chief Technology Officer effective September 20, 2017, and his position as our director effective August 31, 2019.\n2021 Securities Sale and Change in Control\nEffective August 6, 2021, Tianci International, Inc., a Nevada corporation (we, us, or the Company), Chuah Su Mei, our former Chief Executive Officer, President and Director, and Silver Glory Group Limited, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement) pursuant to which Chuah Su Mei agreed to sell to Silver Glory Group Limited all 1,793,000 shares of common stock of the Company held by her (the Shares) for cash consideration of Five Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($525,000) (the Transaction). The Shares represent approximately 73.18% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company and are being sold in reliance upon an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof.

As a result of the Transaction, Silver Glory Group Limited holds a controlling interest in the Company and may unilaterally determine the election of the members of the Board of Directors (the Board) and other substantive matters requiring approval of the Companys stockholders.\nUpon the closing of the Transaction, on August 26, 2021, the then current directors and officers of the Company resigned from his or her positions with the Company.

Each officer and director will serve in his positions without compensation. The Company plans to enter into compensatory arrangements with its officers and directors in the future.\nLimited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital\nWe have had limited operations and have been issued a \"going concern\" opinion by our auditor, based upon our reliance on the sale of our common stock and loans from a related party, as the sole source of funds for our future operations.\nThere is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We have not generated any revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays in the launching of our games and market or wider economic downturns. We do not believe we have sufficient funds to operate our business for the next 12 months.\nWe have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders. If we are unable to raise additional capital to maintain our operations in the future, we may be unable to carry out our full business plan or we may be forced to cease operations.\nGoing Concern\nOur financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. As of July 31, 2022, the Company had working capital deficiency of $222,887 and has incurred losses since its inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $1,700,154. Further losses are anticipated in the development of the business, raising substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nThe ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with loans from directors and/or private placements of common stock.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables provide selected financial data about our company as of and for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021.\nBalance Sheet Data\nJuly 31, July 31,\nChange\nCash $ 9,000 $ 3,951 $ 5,049\nTotal assets 22,250 17,951 4,299\nTotal liabilities 245,387 343,061 (97,674 )\nStockholders' deficit $ (223,137 ) $ (325,110 ) $ 101,973\nSummary Income Statement Data\nYear Ended\nJuly 31,\nChange\nNet Revenue $ - $ - $ -\nTotal Operating Expenses 247,743 63,003 184,740\nLoss From Operations 247,743 63,003 184,740\nOther Expenses - 11,381 (11,381 )\nNet Loss $ 247,743 $ 74,384 $ 173,359\nRevenue.

For the years ended July 31, 2022, and 2021, we incurred a loss from operations of $247,743 and $63,003, respectively. The increase in loss from operations was attributable to the increase in our operating expenses.\nOther Expenses. Other expenses for year ended July 31, 2021, consisted of $11,381 for an income tax penalty.\nNet Loss. For the years ended July 31, 2022, and 2021, we incurred a net loss of $247,743 and $74,384, respectively. The increase in net loss was primarily attributable to the increase in our operating expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nJuly 31, July 31,\nChange\nCurrent Assets $ 22,250 $ 17,951 $ 4,299\nCurrent Liabilities 245,387 343,061 (97,674 )\nWorking Capital (Deficiency) $ (223,137 ) $ (325,110 ) $ 101,973\nAs of July 31, 2022, we had working capital deficit of $223,137 as compared to working capital deficit of $325,110 as of July 31, 2021. The decrease in working capital deficit was mainly due to a decrease in amounts due to related parties for the payment of operating expenses.\nCash Flows\nYear Ended\nJuly 31,\nCash used in operating activities $ (206,390 ) $ (74,248 )\nCash provided by investing activities - -\nCash provided by financing activities 211,439 74,231\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents $ 5,049 $ (17 )\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2022, net cash used in operating activities was $206,390, compared to $74,248 for the year ended July 31, 2021. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was mainly due to the increase in net loss offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, prepaid expenses and an increase in prepaid management fees.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nDuring the years ended July 31, 2022, and 2021, we had no cash flow from investing activities.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities was $211,439, compared to $74,231 for the year ended July 31, 2021. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities was mainly due to the increase in proceeds from related parties.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have not identified any additional critical accounting policies and judgments. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results, which are described in Note 3 to our financial statements. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. Item 7A.

(the Company) as of July 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at July 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans with regard to these matters are described in Note 2. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ KCCW Accountancy Corp.\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2017.\nDiamond Bar, California\nOctober 29, 2022\nTIANCI INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nBALANCE SHEETS\nJuly 31, July 31,\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets\nCash $ 9,000 $ 3,951\nPrepaid expenses 1,750 14,000\nPrepaid compensation 11,500 -\nTotal Current Assets 22,250 17,951\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 22,250 $ 17,951\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' DEFICIT\nCurrent Liabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 50,499 $ 9,896\nDue to related parties 194,888 333,165\nTotal Current Liabilities 245,387 343,061\nTotal Liabilities 245,387 343,061\nCommitments and Contingencies - -\nSHAREHOLDERS' DEFICIT\nPreferred stock, $0.0001 par value; 20,000,000 shares authorized; no shares issued and outstanding - -\nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value, 100,000,000 shares authorized; 2,450,148 shares issued and outstanding\nAdditional paid-in capital 1,477,022 1,127,306\nAccumulated deficit (1,700,404 ) (1,452,661 )\nTotal Shareholders' Deficit\n(223,137 ) (325,110 )\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' DEFICIT $ 22,250 $ 17,951\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\nTIANCI INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nSTATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended\nJuly 31,\nRevenues $ - $ -\nOperating Expenses\nGeneral administrative expenses 174,331\nProfessional fees 73,412 62,379\nTotal Operating Expenses 247,743 63,003\nLoss from Operations (247,743 ) (63,003 )\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther expenses - (11,381 )\nTotal Other Income (Expense) - (11,381 )\nLoss before Income Taxes (247,743 ) (74,384 )\nProvision for income taxes - -\nNet Loss $ (247,743 ) $ (74,384 )\nBasic and diluted loss per common share $ (0.10 ) $ (0.03 )\nBasic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 2,450,148 2,469,065\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\nTIANCI INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nSTATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS DEFICIT\nFOR YEARS ENDED JULY 31, 2022 AND\nCommon Stock Additional\nTotal\nNumber of\nShares\nAmount Paid-in\nCapital\nAccumulated\nDeficit\nShareholders\nDeficit\nBalance - July 31, 2020 4,751,718 1,127,076 (1,378,277 ) (250,726 )\nCancellation of common shares (2,301,570 ) (230 ) - -\nNet loss for the year - - - (74,384 ) (74,384 )\nBalance - July 31, 2021 2,450,148 $ 245 $ 1,127,306 $ (1,452,661 ) $ (325,110 )\nDebt forgiveness by related parties - - 349,716 - 349,716\nNet loss for the year - - - (247,743 ) (247,743 )\nBalance - July 31, 2022 2,450,148 $ 245 $ 1,477,022 $ (1,700,404 ) $ (223,137 )\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements\nTIANCI INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nSTATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nYear Ended\nJuly 31,\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nNet loss $ (247,743 ) $ (74,384 )\nAdjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities:\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities:\nPrepaid expenses 12,250 (2,000 )\nPrepaid compensation (11,500 ) -\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 40,603 2,136\nNet cash used in operating activities (206,390 ) (74,248 )\nCASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES\nProceeds from related parties 212,641 74,231\nRepayment to related parties (1,202 ) -\nNet cash provided by financing activities 211,439 74,231\nNet change in cash 5,049 (17 )\nCash - beginning of period 3,951 3,968\nCash - end of period $ 9,000 $ 3,951\nSupplemental Cash Flow Disclosures\nCash paid for interest $ - $ -\nCash paid for income taxes $ - $ -\nNon-cash financing and investing activities\nCancellation of common shares $ - $ 230\nDebt forgiveness by related parties $ 349,716 $ -\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statement\nTIANCI INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJuly 31, 2022\nNOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nTianci International, Inc. (the Company, Tianci) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, as Freedom Petroleum, Inc. on June 13, 2012. In May 2015, the Company changed its name to Steampunk Wizards, Inc. and on November 9, 2016, the Company changed its name to Tianci International, Inc. As of the date of this report, the Company is a holding company and has not carried out substantive business operations of its own.\nThe Companys fiscal year end is July 31.\nChange of control\nEffective August 6, 2021, Tianci International, Inc., Chuah Su Mei, the Companys former Chief Executive Officer, President and Director, and Silver Glory Group Limited, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement) pursuant to which Chuah Su Mei agreed to sell to Silver Glory Group Limited all 1,793,000 shares of common stock of the Company held by her (the Shares) for cash consideration of Five Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($525,000) (the Transaction). The Shares represent approximately 73.18% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company. The sale of the Shares consummated on August 26, 2021. As a result of the Transaction, Silver Glory Group Limited holds a controlling interest in the Company.\nUpon the closing of the Transaction, on August 26, 2021, each of Chuah Su Chen, Chuah Su Mei, and Jerry Ooi, constituting all current directors and officers of the Company, resigned from his or her positions with the Company. Each of the foregoing former officers and directors also forgave all amounts due to them from the Company in connection with the closing of the Transaction.\nConcurrently with such resignation, Zhigang Pei was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Director and two directors and three independent directors were also appointed to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders of the Company.\nNOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN MATTERS\nAs of July 31, 2022, the Company had $9,000 in cash held in trust. The Company had incurred a net loss of $247,743 for the year ended July 31, 2022.\nThe Companys cash balance and revenues generated are not currently sufficient and cannot be projected to cover operating expenses for the next twelve months from the date of this report. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans include attempting to improve its business profitability, its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from its operations to meet its operating needs on a timely basis, obtain additional working capital funds through equity and debt financing arrangements, and restructure on-going operations to eliminate inefficiencies to raise cash balance in order to meet its anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months from the date of this report. However, there can be no assurance that these plans and arrangements will be sufficient to fund the Companys ongoing capital expenditures, working capital, and other requirements. Management intends to make every effort to identify and develop sources of funds. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time. There can be no assurance that any additional financings will be available to the Company on satisfactory terms and conditions, if at all.\nThe ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital and continue profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe annual financial information referred to above has been prepared and presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to annual financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-K and regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The annual financial information has been prepared on a basis consistent with prior periods and years and includes all disclosures that are necessary and required by applicable laws and regulations.\nThe accompanying financial statements and notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (the U.S. GAAP) and are presented in U.S. dollars. These annual financial statements include all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in trust, and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less. The Company had $9,000 and $3,951 in cash and cash equivalents as of July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nFair Value Measurements\nAs defined in ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement).\nThe Company's financial instruments consist of cash, prepaid expense, accounts payable, and due to related parties. The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate fair value due to either length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company has yet to generate revenues from operations. The Company will recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the Companys deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. See Note 6 for information related to income taxes, including the recorded balances of its valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets.\nBasic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Companys net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Companys net loss available to common stockholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. There are no such common stock equivalents outstanding as of July 31, 2022 and 2021.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nManagement has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued and their potential effect on the financial statements. The Company's management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nNOTE 4 - DUE TO RELATED PARTIES\nDuring the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, the former and current shareholder of the Company advanced $212,641 and $74,231 for working capital purpose, respectively.\nDuring the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company repaid $1,202 and $0 due to a former shareholder of the Company, respectively.\nOn August 26, 2021 and pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement dated on August 6, 2021 (see Note 1 - Change of control), Chuah Su Mei, the Companys former Chief Executive Officer, President and Director and all other former officers forgave all amounts due to them from the Company. In regard to this forgiveness, the Company recognized debt forgiveness by related parties of $349,716 as additional paid-in-capital.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company accrued $168,300 for the compensation of its CEO and five directors. During the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company paid compensation of $126,500 to the five directors. As of July 31, 2022, the Company owed $41,800 unpaid compensation to the CEO, which was included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and prepaid the amount of $11,500 for compensation to the five directors.\nAs of July 31, 2022, and July 31, 2021, the Company owed $194,888 and $333,165, respectively, to a shareholder of the Company. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and due on demand.\nNOTE 5 - EQUITY\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company has 20,000,000 authorized preferred shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. The Board of Directors are authorized to divide the authorized shares of Preferred Stock into one or more series, each of which shall be so designated as to distinguish the shares thereof from the shares of all other series and classes.\nThere were no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding as of July 31, 2022 and 2021.\nCommon Stock\nThe Company has 100,000,000 authorized common shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share.\nOn August 4, 2020, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company cancelled 301,570 shares of common stock and Chief Financial Officer of the Company cancelled 2,000,000 shares of common stock.\nAs of July 31, 2022, and 2021, there were 2,450,148 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, respectively.\nNOTE 6 - INCOME TAXES\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and state and local jurisdictions.\nThe Company follows ASC 740. Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of (a) temporary difference between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes, and (b) net operating loss carry-forwards. No net provision for refundable Federal income tax has been made in the accompanying statements of operations because no recoverable taxes were paid previously. Similarly, no deferred tax asset attributable to the net operating loss carry-forward has been recognized, as it is not deemed likely to be realized.\nThe income tax benefit for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021 consists of the following:\nSchedule of components of income tax expense\nFor the Years Ended\nJuly 31,\nLoss before income tax $ (247,743 ) $ (74,384 )\nTax rate 21% 21%\nIncome tax expense (benefit) at statutory rate $ (52,026 ) $ (15,621 )\nChange in valuation allowance 52,026 15,621\nIncome tax expense (benefit) $ - $ -\nDeferred taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts recorded for tax purposes. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nSchedule of deferred tax assets\nAs of July 31,\nNOL Carryover $ 546,983 $ 494,957\nValuation allowance (546,983 ) (494,957 )\nNet deferred tax asset $ - $ -\nThe reconciliation of the effective income tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate as of July 31, 2022 and 2021:\nSchedule of effective income tax reconciliation\nAs of July 31,\nFederal income tax (benefit) (21)% (21)%\nIncrease in valuation allowance 21% 21%\nEffective income tax rate 0% 0%\nAt July 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $2,604,680 and $2,356,937, respectively of the U.S. net operating losses (the U.S. NOLs), which begin to expire beginning in 2035. NOLs generated in tax years prior to July 31, 2018, can be carryforward for twenty years, whereas NOLs generated after July 31,2018 can be carryforward indefinitely.\nThe Company assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will not be realized. FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all, or a portion of, deferred tax assets will not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered, including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. After consideration of all the information available, management believes that uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of its deferred tax assets and has, therefore, established a full valuation allowance as of July 31, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company has not completed its evaluation of NOL utilization limitation under IRC Section 382, change of ownership rules, but believes that it had a change of ownership that would limit the amount of U.S. NOLs that could be utilized each year based on the Internal Revenue Code, as Amended.\nThe Companys tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities beginning with the year ended July 31, 2018.\nNOTE 7 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe Company had no other commitments or contingencies as of July 31, 2022.\nFrom time to time the Company may become a party to litigation matters involving claims against the Company.\nManagement believes that it is adequately insured for its operations and there are no current matters that would have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nNOTE 8 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nManagement has evaluated subsequent events through the date which the financial statements were available to be issued. All subsequent events requiring recognition as of July 31, 2022 have been incorporated into these financial statements and there are no subsequent events that require disclosure in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nThere were no disagreements with our accountants related to accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, internal controls or auditing scope or procedure during the two fiscal years and subsequent interim periods. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\")/Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\"), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We conducted an evaluation (the Evaluation), under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO/CFO of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (Disclosure Controls) as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation and the existence of the material weaknesses discussed below in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, our management, including our CEO/CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this Report.\nWe do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u00b7 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n\u00b7 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n\u00b7 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Additionally, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of July 31, 2022, due to the existence of the material weaknesses as of July 31, 2022, discussed below. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in the following areas:\n\u00b7 Because of the companys limited resources, there are limited controls over information processing.\n\u00b7 There is an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Our Companys management is composed of only one person, resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. In order to remedy this situation, we would need to hire additional staff to provide greater segregation of duties. Currently, it is not feasible to hire additional staff to obtain optimal segregation of duties. Management will reassess this matter in the following year to determine whether improvement in segregation of duty is feasible.\n\u00b7 The Company does not have a sitting audit committee financial expert, and as a result of the recent change in control, an audit committee, and thus the Company lacks the board oversight role within the financial reporting process.\n\u00b7 There is a lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions. The Company utilizes a third-party independent contractor for the preparation of its financial statements. Although the financial statements and footnotes are reviewed by our management, we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment of such transactions. The third-party independent contractor is not involved in the day to day operations of the Company and may not be provided information from management on a timely basis to allow for adequate reporting/consideration of certain transactions.\nManagement believes that the material weaknesses set forth above were the result of the scale of our operations and are intrinsic to our small size. Management believes these weaknesses did not have a material effect on our financial results and intends to take remedial actions upon receiving funding for the Companys business operations.\nOur management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Companys registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting due to permanent exemptions for smaller reporting companies.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOther than as described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time. Our system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. Item 9B. Other Information\nNone.\nPART III Item 10.

As adopted, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics sets forth written standards that are designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote:\n1. honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;\n2. full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that we file with, or submit to, the Securities and Exchange Commission and in other public communications made by us;\n3. compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;\n4. the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to an appropriate person or persons identified in the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics; and\n5. accountability for adherence to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.\nOur Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires, among other things, that all of our company's senior officers commit to timely, accurate and consistent disclosure of information; that they maintain confidential information; and that they act with honesty and integrity.\nIn addition, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics emphasizes that all employees, and particularly senior officers, have a responsibility for maintaining financial integrity within our company, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, and federal and state securities laws. Any senior officer, who becomes aware of any incidents involving financial or accounting manipulation or other irregularities, whether by witnessing the incident or being told of it, must report it to our company. Any failure to report such inappropriate or irregular conduct of others is to be treated as a severe disciplinary matter. It is against our company policy to retaliate against any individual who reports in good faith the violation or potential violation of our company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by another.\nOur Code of Business Conduct and Ethics was filed as Exhibit 14.1 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended July 31, 2013. We will provide a copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to any person without charge, upon request. Requests can be sent to: Tianci International, Inc., Attn: Secretary, 20 Holbeche Road, Arndell Park, NSW, Australia.\nBoard Meetings\nOur board of directors consists of Zhigang Pei, Shufang Gao, David Wei Fang, Jack Fan Liu, Yee Man Yung and Jimmy Weiyu Zhu. The board held no formal meetings during the year ended July 31, 2022, but took actions once via unanimous written consent. We expect our current board to act by written consent or through board meetings in accordance with the provisions of the Nevada General Corporate Law and our Bylaws.\nNomination Process\nAs of July 31, 2022, we did not effect any material changes to the procedures by which our shareholders may recommend nominees to our board of directors. Our board of directors does not have a policy with regards to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by our shareholders. Our board of directors has determined that it is in the best position to evaluate our companys requirements as well as the qualifications of each candidate when the board considers a nominee for a position on our board of directors. If shareholders wish to recommend candidates directly to our board, they may do so by sending communications to the president of our company at the address on the cover of this annual report.\nCorporate Governance & Board Independence\nOur Board of Directors consists of six directors. We have adopted a standard of director independence that conforms with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market. Jack Fan Liu, Yee Man Yung and Jimmy Weiyu Zhu are independent directors. As of the date hereof, we do not have a policy that a majority of our board be comprised of independent directors.\nPrior to our change of control, we had established an audit committee. We intend to establish a new audit committee in the future. We believe that members of our audit committee will capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. We believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an \"audit committee financial expert\" would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the fact that we have not generated any material revenues to date.\nWe have not yet established a Nominating or Governance Committees as standing committees but expect to do so as our business matures. The Board does not have an executive committee or any committees performing a similar function. We are not currently listed on a national securities exchange or in an inter-dealer quotation system that has requirements that a majority of the board of directors be independent. All functions of a nominating/governance committee were performed by our whole board of directors. Our board of directors intends to appoint such persons and form such committees as are required to meet the corporate governance requirements imposed by the national securities exchanges as necessary. Our board of directors does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees at the early stage of the companys development, and our board of directors believes that the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by the members of our board of directors.\nInvolvement in Certain Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in various claims, lawsuits, and disputes with third parties, actions involving allegations of discrimination or breach of contract actions incidental to the normal operations of the business. We may be named as a defendant in such lawsuits and thus become subject to the attendant risk of substantial damage awards. We believe that we have adequate liability insurance coverage. There can be no assurance, however, that we will not be sued, that any such lawsuit will not exceed our insurance coverage, or that we will be able to maintain such coverage at acceptable costs and on favorable terms.\nWe are not a party to, nor is any of our property the subject of, any legal proceedings. There are no proceedings pending in which any of our officers, directors or 5% shareholders are adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries or in which they are taking a position or have a material interest that is adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries. Item 11. Executive Compensation\nCompensation Philosophy and Objectives\nCurrently, our executive directors and officers do not receive compensation for services in such capacities. We expect to establish a compensation plan as our company matures. We expect that our executive compensation philosophy will be to create a long-term direct relationship between pay and our performance. Our executive compensation program will be designed to provide a balanced total compensation package over the executives career with us. The compensation program objectives will be to attract, motivate and retain the qualified executives that help ensure our future success, to provide incentives for increasing our profits by awarding executives when corporate goals are achieved and to align the interests of executives and long-term stockholders. We expect the compensation package of our named executive officers to consist of two main elements:\n1. base salary for our executives that is competitive relative to the market, and that reflects individual performance, retention and other relevant considerations; and\n2. discretionary bonus awards payable in cash and tied to the satisfaction of corporate objectives.\nProcess for Setting Executive Compensation\nAs we do not have Compensation Committee, our Board will be responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of our philosophy with respect to the compensation of executives and for monitoring the implementation and results of the compensation philosophy to ensure compensation remains competitive, creates proper incentives to enhance stockholder value and rewards superior performance. The Board or Compensation Committee will annually review and approve for each named executive officer, and particularly with regard to the Chief Executive Officer, all components of the executives compensation. The Board or Compensation Committee may award discretionary bonuses to each of the named executives, and reviews and approves the process and factors (including individual and corporate performance measures and actual performance versus such measures) used by the Chief Executive Officer to recommend such awards. Additionally, the Board or Compensation Committee will review and approve the base salary, equity-incentive awards (if any) and any other special or supplemental benefits of the named executive officers.\nWe expect out Chief Executive Officer to periodically provide the Board or Compensation Committee with an evaluation of each named executive officers performance, based on the individual performance goals and objectives developed by the Chief Executive Officer at the beginning of the year, as well as other factors. The Board of Compensation Committee will provide an evaluation for the Chief Executive Officer. These evaluations will serve as the bases for bonus recommendations and changes in the compensation arrangements of our named executives.\nOur Compensation Peer Group\nWe expect to engage in informal market analysis in evaluating our executive compensation arrangements. As the Company and its businesses mature, we may retain compensation consultants that will assist us in developing a formal benchmark and selecting a compensation peer group of companies similar to us in size or business for the purpose of comparing executive compensation levels.\nProgram Components\nWe expect our executive compensation program to consist of the following elements:\nBase Salary\nOur base salary structure will be designed to encourage internal growth, attract and retain new talent, and reward strong leadership that will sustain our growth and profitability. The base salary for each named executive officer will reflect our past and current operating profits, the named executive officers individual contribution to our success throughout his career, internal pay equity and informal market data regarding comparable positions within similarly situated companies. In determining and setting base salary, the Board/Compensation Committee will consider all of these factors, though it will not assign specific weights to any factor. The Board/Compensation Committee will generally review the base salary for each named executive officer on an annual basis. For each of our named executive officers, we expect to review base salary data internally obtained by the Company for comparable executive positions in similarly situated companies to ensure that the base salary rate for each executive is competitive relative to the market.\nDiscretionary Bonus\nThe objectives of our bonus awards will be to encourage and reward our employees, including the named executive officers, who contribute to and participate in our success by their ability, industry, leadership, loyalty or exceptional service and to recruit additional executives who will contribute to that success.\nEach of our named executive officers will be eligible for consideration for a discretionary cash bonus. The Chief Executive Officer will make recommendations regarding bonus awards for the named executive officers and the Board/Compensation Committee provides the bonus recommendation for the Chief Executive Officer. However, the Board/Compensation Committee will have sole and final authority and discretion in designating to whom awards are made, the size of the award, if any, and its terms and conditions. The bonus recommendation for each of the named executive officers depends on a number of factors, including (i) the performance of the Company for the year, (ii) the satisfaction of certain individual and corporate performance measures, and (iii) other factors which the Compensation Committee may deem relevant. The Company did not award any cash bonuses during fiscal year 2022.\nStock Holdings\nThe Board/Compensation Committee recognizes the importance of having a portion of the named executive officers compensation be paid in the form of equity, to help align the executives interests with the interests of the Companys stockholders. Initially, we expect the Board/Compensation Committee to emphasize the cash-based portion of our compensation program over a stock program because it believes the discretionary nature of the cash-based compensation gives it the needed flexibility to factor in and reward the attainment of longer-term goals for the Company and the executives, as the Board/Compensation Committee deems appropriate.\nWe have not timed nor do we plan to time our release of material non-public information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation.\nThe following tables set forth, for each of the last two completed fiscal years of the Company, the total compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to any person who was a principal executive officer during the preceding fiscal year and every other highest compensated executive officers earning more than $100,000 during the last fiscal year (together, the Named Executive Officers). The tables set forth below reflect the compensation of the Named Executive Officers.\nSUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE\nName and Principal\nPosition Year Salary\n($) Bonus\n($) Stock Awards\n($) Option Awards\n($) Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation\n($) Change in Pension\nValue and\nNonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings\n($) All Other Compensation\n($) Total\n($)\nChuah Su Mei - - - - - - - -\n(1) - - - - - - - -\nZhigang Pei 41,800 - - - - - - 41,800\n(2) - - - - - - - -\nShufang Gao 41,800 - - - - - - 41,800\n(3) - - - - - - - -\nDavid Wei Fang 41,800 - - - - - - 41,800\n(3) - - - - - - - -\nJack Fan Liu 14.300 - - - - - - 14,300\n(3) - - - - - - - -\nYee Man Yung 14,300 - - - - - - 14,300\n(3) - - - - - - - -\nJimmy Weiyu Zhu 14,300 - - - - - - 14,300\n(3) - - - - - - - -\n(1) Ms. Chuah was appointed our Chief Executive Officer, President and Director on August 15, 2017.

Our directors and executive officers may receive share options at the discretion of our board of directors in the future.
