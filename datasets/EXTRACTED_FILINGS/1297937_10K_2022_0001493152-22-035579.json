    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nParks! America, Inc., through our wholly owned subsidiaries, owns and operates three regional theme parks and is in the business of acquiring, developing and operating local and regional theme parks and attractions in the United States. Our wholly owned subsidiaries are Wild Animal Safari, Inc., a Georgia corporation (Wild Animal - Georgia), Wild Animal, Inc., a Missouri corporation (Wild Animal - Missouri), and Aggieland-Parks, Inc., a Texas corporation (Aggieland Wild Animal - Texas). Wild Animal - Georgia owns and operates the Wild Animal Safari theme park in Pine Mountain, Georgia (the Georgia Park). Wild Animal - Missouri owns and operates the Wild Animal Safari theme park located in Strafford, Missouri (the Missouri Park). Aggieland Wild Animal - Texas owns and operates the Aggieland Wild Animal Safari theme park near Bryan/College Station, Texas (the Texas Park). We acquired our Georgia Park on June 13, 2005, our Missouri Park on March 5, 2008, and our Texas Park on April 27, 2020.\nOur parks are open year round, but experience increased seasonal attendance, typically beginning in the latter half of March through early September. Combined third and fourth quarter net sales were 62.1% and 60.3% of annual attendance based net sales for our 2022 and 2021 fiscal years, respectively. Since the acquisition of our Texas Park, the combined third and fourth quarter concentration of our sales has been reduced.\nOur business plan includes expansion via the acquisition of additional local or regional theme parks and attractions. We believe acquisitions, if any, should not unnecessarily encumber the Company with additional debt that cannot be justified by current operations. We may also pursue contract management opportunities for themed attractions owned by third parties. By using a combination of equity, debt and other financing options, we intend to carefully monitor stockholder value in conjunction with the pursuit of growth.\nShares of our common stock trade on the OTC Markets Group OTCPink marketplace (OTCPink) under the symbol, PRKA.\nFor an overview of our business operations, see MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein.\nCorporate History\nThe Company was originally incorporated on July 30, 1954 as Painted Desert Uranium & Oil Co., Inc. in Washington State. On October 1, 2002, Painted Desert Uranium & Oil Co., Inc. changed its name to Royal Pacific Resources, Inc. and its corporate domicile to the State of Nevada.\nOn December 19, 2003, Royal Pacific Resources, Inc. acquired the assets of Great Western Parks LLC pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement that set the stage for our current corporate structure and operating strategy. We changed the name of the Company to Great American Family Parks, Inc. The acquisition was accounted for as a reverse acquisition in which Great Western Parks was considered the acquirer of Royal Pacific Resources for reporting purposes. As of June 11, 2008, the Company changed its name from Great American Family Parks, Inc. to its current name, Parks! America, Inc. In addition, effective June 25, 2008, the Companys quotation symbol on the OTCPink was changed from GFAM to PRKA.\nWild Animal Safari, Inc. - Our Georgia Park\nOn June 13, 2005, Wild Animal - Georgia acquired our Georgia Park in Pine Mountain, Georgia. Our Georgia Park is situated within a 200-acre portion of a 500-acre plot, which is owned by Wild Animal - Georgia, located approximately 75 miles southwest of Atlanta. Our Georgia Park features a three-mile drive-through animal viewing area that opened in 1991. It is home to over 500 animals, birds and reptiles, comprised of over 65 species. The majority of the animals roam wild in a natural habitat. Visitors can observe, photograph and feed the animals along the paved road that runs through the drive-through section of our Georgia Parks natural habitat area. Some animals are contained in special fenced-in exhibit areas within the natural habitat, drive-through section of our Georgia Park, while others are in a more traditional zoo-like walk through section of the park, the Walkabout Adventure Zoo, which also includes a reptile house, featuring reptiles from several continents.\nWild Animal, Inc. - Our Missouri Park\nWild Animal - Missouri purchased our Missouri Park as of March 5, 2008. Our Missouri Park is situated in Strafford, Missouri on 255 acres of land located 12 miles east of Springfield and approximately 45 miles north of Branson. Our Missouri Park features a five-mile drive-through wild animal viewing area that opened in 1971. It is home to approximately 350 animals, birds and reptiles, comprised of over 65 species. Most of the animals roam wild throughout the natural habitat. Visitors can observe, photograph and feed the animals along the paved road that runs throughout the drive-through section of our Missouri Parks natural habitat area. Some animals are contained in special fenced-in exhibit areas within the natural habitat, drive-through section of our Missouri Park and other animals are in a more traditional zoo-like walk through section of the park, the Walkabout Adventure Zoo, which also contains a reptile house, featuring reptiles from several continents.\nAggieland-Parks, Inc. - Our Texas Park\nAggieland Wild Animal - Texas acquired our Texas Park on April 27, 2020. Our Texas Park is situated on 250 acres of a 450-acre property, located approximately 25 miles northeast of Bryan/College Station, Texas and 120 miles northwest of downtown Houston. Our Texas Park features a two-and-a-half mile drive-through animal viewing area that opened in 2019. It is home to over 650 animals, birds and reptiles, comprised of over 70 species. The majority of the animals roam wild in a natural habitat. Visitors can observe, photograph and feed the animals along a crushed-gravel road that runs throughout the drive-through section of our Texas Parks natural habitat area. Our Texas Park also includes a 20-acre Walkabout Adventure Zoo, featuring outdoor and indoor animal exhibits, a reptile house, two aviaries, extensive giraffe and tortoise encounter areas, an otter exhibit, and a large hippopotamus enclosure and pond.\nAnimal Park Operations\nPark revenues are primarily derived from admission fees, food and beverage sales, gift shop and specialty item sales, and sales of animal food. During our 2022 fiscal year, we introduced private and semi-private animal keeper guided animal encounters at each of our parks. We also introduced vehicle rentals at our Missouri and Texas Parks, which have been a customer favorite at our Georgia Park for over a decade. Managements plans to grow revenues at each of our parks include ongoing improvements to existing facilities, making each park more attractive to visitors and developing unused acreage. We also believe that increasing local and regional awareness of each park via advertising and promotion is a critical element of our revenue growth plans, especially for our Texas and Missouri Parks.\nIn addition to the animal environments, each of our parks contain a gift shop, a restaurant or concessions areas, and picnic areas. We sell food and beverages in our restaurants or concession areas, and a variety of items in our gift shops, including shirts, hats, educational books, toys and novelty items, many of which are animal themed. Our 2023 fiscal year plans include the continuing renovation of walk about animal habitats and enclosures, especially at our Georgia Park, completion of a new otter exhibit at our Missouri Park, and the completion of expanded food service capabilities and offerings at our Texas Park. Our plan to open a significant new giraffe exhibit at our Georgia Park during our 2022 fiscal year experienced delays due to a highly inflationary period for building materials and a challenging labor market. We remain committed to this showcase attraction and expect to make progress on this project during our 2023 fiscal year, however the opening date is still unknown. Increasing attendance, as well as increasing the per capita income generated in our gift shops and from concessions, continues to be a primary focus.\nMost of the animals at each of our parks have been born on-site or domestically acquired. We rarely import animals and have not imported any animals in the past 10 years. Auctions and sales of animals across the United States occur often and we may acquire animals in these auctions if we see an opportunity to enhance the animal population at our parks. As a result of natural breeding, animal populations at our Parks tend to grow over time. Periodically, we sell surplus animals, and the proceeds are recorded as revenue. The periodic acquisition and sale of animals is also part of our herd and genetic management program. From time-to-time, we may also relocate animals between our parks as part of this program. Each park is subject to routine inspection by federal and state agencies. Each park maintains a high standard of animal care and has passed all recent inspections.\nEmployees\nOur Georgia Park has approximately 25 full-time employees and engages a range of 20-35 additional part-time and seasonal employees. Our Missouri Park has approximately 12 full-time employees and engages in the range of 10-20 additional part-time and seasonal employees. Our Texas Park has approximately 14 full-time employees and engages in the range of 10-20 additional part-time and seasonal employees. We also engage consultants from time to time. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and believe our relations with our employees are good. Parks! America has three officers and one manager who oversee the strategy of the Company, the operations and capital investment activities of our Parks, as well as the overall financial activities, controls and reporting for the Company and each Park. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors below for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic or similar public health risks and measures taken in response thereto may have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows, and financial condition. The extent of the impact is dependent upon future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel strain of a coronavirus, as a pandemic. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has resulted in governmental authorities throughout the United States implementing a variety of containment measures with the objective of slowing the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns. The COVID-19 pandemic and these containment measures have the potential to have a material impact on the Companys business.\nWe implemented several measures to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on our business and financial position. During the initial shutdown period, we reduced staffing, applied for and received Paycheck Protection Program loans and reduced discretionary spending. In addition, we delayed closing the Texas Park acquisition to renegotiate various terms, primarily focused on reducing the cash requirements of the acquisition in the subsequent year.\nIn early April 2020, our Georgia and Missouri Parks closed to the public due to shelter-in-place mandates. In addition, our Texas Park was closed to the public for the month prior to its acquisition, due to a shelter-in-place mandate. In compliance with respective state issued guidelines, each of our parks reopened in early May 2020. After reopening, attendance levels increased significantly at each of our parks for the balance of its 2020 fiscal year, which continued throughout our 2021 fiscal year in comparison to comparable pre-COVID-19 periods. While attendance based net sales remain higher compared to pre-COVID-19 periods, we experienced a decline in comparable year-over-year attendance based net sales and attendance for the last 22 weeks of our 2021 fiscal year and for our entire 2022 fiscal year, respectively.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates, our future operations are dependent on factors outside of our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of this pandemic or similar public health risks. While we have experienced attendance gains and strong cash flow in comparison to periods preceding the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be longer-term negative impacts to our business, results of operations and cash flows, and financial condition as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative impacts may include changes in customer behavior and preferences, increases in operating expenses to meet consumer expectations and perceptions, limitations in our ability to recruit and maintain staffing, as well as increasing wages required retain and recruit staff. There is also the potential for attendance levels at our parks to moderate or decline as alternative entertainment venues are now open and consumers have broader travel and entertainment options.\nThe extent and duration of longer-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or similar public health risks on customer perceptions of our parks are largely uncertain and dependent upon future developments that cannot be accurately predicted. There is no recent historical precedent that provides insights into the longer-term impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on consumer behavior. As a result, the ultimate impact is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent COVID-19 will have on our overall business, results of operations and cash flows, and financial position. COVID-19 and the resulting economic disruptions have also led to significant volatility in the capital markets. As a smaller public company, our ability to access cash is already difficult and the impacts of COVID-19 on capital markets has likely negatively impacted our ability to raise additional capital at a reasonable cost.\nGeneral economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business and operating results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels, tax rates, unemployment, consumer credit availability, raw materials costs, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and natural disasters, fuel and energy costs (including oil prices), and credit market conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted and will likely continue to impact many of these factors. A general economic slowdown or recession resulting in a decrease in discretionary spending could adversely affect the frequency with which guests choose to visit our parks and the amount that our guests spend when they visit. Our ability to source supplies, materials and services at reasonable costs and in a timely manner could be impacted by adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad. For example, our ability to obtain gift shop merchandise had been adversely impacted by recent supply chain distributions at least in part attributed to collateral impacts from COVID-19. Similarly, our plans to open a new giraffe exhibit at out Georgia Park experienced delays during our 2022 fiscal year, in large part due building material price increases and labor storages in the construction industry.\nConditions beyond our control, including natural disasters or extreme weather, could damage our properties and could adversely impact attendance at our parks and result in decreased revenues.\nNatural disasters, public heath crises, epidemics, pandemics, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, terrorist activities, power outages or other events outside our control could disrupt our operations, impair critical systems, damage our properties or reduce attendance at our parks or require temporary park closures. Damage to our properties could take a long time to repair and there is no guarantee that we would have adequate insurance to cover the costs of repair or the expense of the interruption to our business. Furthermore, natural disasters such as fires, earthquakes, hurricanes or extreme weather events linked to climate change, may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties or require evacuations and may cause attendance at our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period. For example, our Texas Park was closed for several weeks, experienced power outages and sustained property damage associated with winter storms in February 2021. The occurrence of such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict the frequency, duration or severity of these activities and the effect that they may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Theme Park Industry is highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete effectively.\nThe theme park industry is highly competitive, highly fragmented, rapidly evolving, and subject to technological change and intense marketing by providers with similar products. One of our competitors for attracting general recreation dollars, Callaway Gardens, is located within five miles of our Georgia Park. In May 2018, Great Wolf Resorts opened an expansive lodge and indoor waterpark within 10 miles of our Georgia Park. In September 2017, the founder of Bass Pro Shops opened Johnny Morris Wonders of Wildlife National Museum and Aquarium, approximately 12 miles from our Missouri Park in Springfield, Missouri. Branson, Missouri is located just 45 minutes from our Missouri Park. There are a variety of animal attractions throughout southeastern Texas; the nearest is Franklin Drive Thru Safari, within a 35-40 minute drive of our Texas Park. Many of our current competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial, technical, operational, marketing and other resources and experience than we have. In the event that a competitor expends significant sales and marketing resources in one or several markets we may not be able to compete successfully in such markets. We believe that competition will continue to increase, potentially placing downward pressure on prices. Such pressure could adversely affect our gross margins if we are not able to reduce costs commensurate with such price reductions. In addition, the pace of technological change makes it impossible for us to predict whether we will face new competitors using different technologies to provide the same or similar products offered or proposed to be offered by us. If our competitors were to provide better and more cost effective products, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face strong competition from numerous entertainment alternatives.\nIn addition to competing with other themed and amusement parks, our venues compete with other types of recreational venues and entertainment alternatives, including but not limited to movies, sports attractions, vacation travel and video games. There can be no assurance that we will successfully differentiate ourselves from these entertainment alternatives or that consumers will consider our entertainment offerings to be more appealing than those of our competitors. The increasing availability and quality of technology-based entertainment has provided families with a wider selection of entertainment alternatives in their homes, including home entertainment units, in-home and online gaming, as well as on-demand streaming video and related access to various forms of entertainment. In addition, traditional theme parks have been able to reduce the cost and increase the variety of their attractions by implementing technologies that cannot be readily incorporated by wild animal attractions such as our Parks.\nThe suspension or termination of any of our business licenses may have a negative impact on our business.\nWe maintain a variety of business licenses issued by federal, state and local government agencies that are required to be renewed periodically. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in renewing all our licenses on a periodic basis. The suspension, termination or expiration of one or more of these licenses could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and profits. In addition, any changes to the requirements for any of our licenses could affect our ability to maintain the licenses.\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our insurance costs may increase.\nCompanies engaged in the theme park business may be sued for substantial damages in the event of an actual or alleged accident. An accident occurring at our Parks or at competing parks may reduce attendance, increase insurance premiums, and negatively impact our operating results. Our properties contain drive-through, safari style animal parks, and there are inherent risks associated with allowing the public to interact with animals. Although we carry liability insurance to cover this risk, there can be no assurance that our coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities, or that we will be able to afford or obtain adequate coverage should a catastrophic incident occur.\nWe currently have $6.0 million of liability insurance per occurrence, which is capped at $10.0 million in aggregate. We will continue to use reasonable commercial efforts to maintain policies of liability, fire and casualty insurance sufficient to provide reasonable coverage for risks arising from accidents, fire, weather, other acts of God, and other potential casualties. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate levels of insurance to protect against suits and judgments in connection with accidents or other disasters that may occur in our Parks.\nWe may not identify or complete acquisitions in a timely, cost-effective manner, if at all.\nOur business plan includes expansion via the acquisition of additional local or regional theme parks and attractions. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring and operating additional local or regional theme parks and attractions. Competition for acquisition opportunities in the theme park industry is intense as there are a limited number of parks within the United States that could reasonably qualify as acquisition targets for us. Our acquisition strategy is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to: identify acquisition opportunities; obtain debt and equity financing; and obtain necessary regulatory approvals. Our ability to pursue our acquisition strategy may be hindered if we are not able to successfully identify acquisition targets or obtain the necessary financing or regulatory approvals, including but not limited to those arising under federal and state antitrust and environmental laws.\nSignificant amounts of additional financing may be necessary for the implementation of our Business Plan.\nThe Company may require additional debt and equity financing to pursue its business plan. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional financing. Lack of additional funding could force us to substantially curtail our expansion plans. Furthermore, the issuance by the Company of any additional securities would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders and may affect the price of our common stock.\nOur ownership of real property subjects us to environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities.\nWe may be required to incur costs to comply with environmental requirements, such as those relating to discharges to air, water and land; the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste; and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. Under these and other environmental requirements we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at one of our properties. As an owner or operator, we could also be held responsible to a governmental entity or third party for property damage, personal injury and investigation and cleanup costs incurred by them in connection with any contamination. Environmental laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. The liability under environmental laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of the responsibility. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to use our property. We are not currently aware of any material environmental risks regarding our properties. However, we may be required to incur costs to remediate potential environmental hazards or to mitigate environmental risks in the future.\nWe are dependent upon the services of our Executive Officers, key personnel and consultants.\nOur success is heavily dependent on the continued active participation of our executive officers. Loss of the services of one or more of these officers could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFurther, our success and achievement of our growth plans depend on our ability to recruit, hire, train and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. Competition for qualified employees among companies in the theme park industry is intense, and the loss of any such persons, or an inability to attract, retain and motivate any additional highly skilled employees required for the expansion of the Companys activities, could have a materially adverse effect on the Company. The inability of the Company to attract and retain the necessary personnel, and consultants and advisors could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreased labor and employee benefit costs may negatively impact our results of operations. We also depend on a seasonal workforce, many of whom are paid at or near minimum wage.\nLabor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates, unemployment levels, and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits. Furthermore, our operations are dependent in part on a seasonal workforce, many of whom are paid at or near minimum wage. We seek to manage seasonal wages and the timing of the hiring process to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place for peak and low seasons; however, we may be unable to recruit and hire sufficient personnel to meet our business needs. In addition, we cannot guarantee that material increases in the cost of securing our workforce will not occur in the future. Increased state or federal minimum wage requirements, general wages or an inadequate workforce could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We anticipate that the recent upward pressures on general wage rates may increase our salary, wage and benefit expenses in our 2023 fiscal year and beyond, and further legislative changes or competitive wage rates could continue to increase these expenses in the future.\nData privacy regulation and our ability to comply could harm our business.\nWe (or third parties on our behalf) collect, store and use personal information and other customer data we receive through online ticket sales, marketing, mailing lists, and guest reservations. There are multiple federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and protection of personal information and data, and these laws and regulations continue to evolve. For example, many states have passed laws requiring notification to customers when there is a security breach involving their personal data and multiple jurisdictions are considering legislation that may impose liability if a business fails to properly safeguard personal information of its customers. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs. While we believe our cybersecurity measures are adequate, if we were to experience a data breach, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or costly litigation.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Common Stock:\nOur Common Stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the SEC and the trading market in our Common Stock is limited, which makes transactions in our Common Stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our Common Stock.\nOur common stock is considered a penny stock and the sale of our stock by you will be subject to the penny stock rules of the SEC. The penny stock rules require broker-dealers to take steps before making any penny stock trades in customer accounts. As a result, the market for our shares could be illiquid and there could be delays in the trading of our stock, which would negatively affect your ability to sell your shares and could negatively affect the trading price of your shares.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends for some time, if at all.\nAs of the date of this report, no cash dividends have been paid on our common stock. We expect that any income from operations will be devoted to our future operations and growth, as well as to service our debt. We do not expect to pay cash dividends in the near future. Any future determination as to the payment of dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, operating and financial condition, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. The provisions of credit agreements, which we may enter into from time to time, may also restrict the declaration of dividends on our common stock. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nThe Company owns and operates the following wild animal theme parks:\nWild Animal Safari, Inc. - Our Georgia Park\nOur Georgia Park is situated within a 200-acre portion of a 500-acre plot, which is owned by Wild Animal - Georgia, located approximately 75 miles southwest of Atlanta. Our Georgia Park features a three-mile drive-through animal viewing area that opened in 1991. It is home to over 500 animals, birds and reptiles, comprised of over 65 species. The majority of the animals roam wild in a natural habitat. Visitors can observe, photograph and feed the animals along the paved road that runs through the drive-through section of our Georgia Parks natural habitat area. Some animals are contained in special fenced-in exhibit areas within the natural habitat, drive-through section of our Georgia Park, while others are in a more traditional zoo-like walk through section, the Walkabout Adventure Zoo, which also includes a reptile house, featuring reptiles from several continents. In addition to the animal environments, our Georgia Park contains a gift shop, a restaurant and picnic areas. During our 2022 fiscal year we implemented various animal exhibit and habitat improvements to the Walkabout Adventure Zoo section of our Georgia Park, with plans to continue the transformation of this area of the park in 2023.\nWild Animal, Inc. - Our Missouri Park\nOur Missouri Park is situated in Strafford, Missouri on 255 acres of land located 12 miles east of Springfield and approximately 45 miles north of Branson. Our Missouri Park features a five-mile drive-through wild animal viewing area that opened in 1971. It is home to approximately 350 animals, birds and reptiles, comprised of over 65 species. Most of the animals roam wild throughout the natural habitat. Visitors can observe, photograph and feed the animals along the paved road that runs throughout the drive-through section of our Missouri Parks natural habitat area. Some animals are contained in special fenced-in areas within the natural habitat, drive-through section of our Missouri Park and other animals are in a more traditional zoo-like atmosphere, the Walkabout Adventure Zoo, which also contains a reptile house, featuring reptiles from several continents. During our 2020 fiscal year we completed an expanded giraffe exhibit, which allows our guests to view and feed our giraffes year round. A new otter exhibit is scheduled to open at our Missouri Park during the second quarter of our 2023 fiscal year. Our Missouri Park also has a gift shop, a restaurant, and several party rooms for rental.\nAggieland-Parks, Inc. - Our Texas Park\nOur Texas Park is situated on 250 acres of a 450-acre property, located approximately 25 miles northeast Bryan/College Station, Texas and 120 miles northwest of downtown Houston. Our Texas Park features a two-and-a-half mile drive-through animal viewing area that opened in 2019. It is home to over 650 animals, birds and reptiles, comprised of over 70 species. The majority of the animals roam wild in a natural habitat. Visitors can observe, photograph and feed the animals along a crushed-gravel road that runs throughout the drive-through section of our Texas Parks natural habitat area. Our Texas Park also includes a 20-acre Walkabout Adventure Zoo, featuring outdoor and indoor animal exhibits, a reptile barn, two aviaries, extensive giraffe and tortoise encounter areas, an otter exhibit, and a large hippopotamus enclosure and pond. In addition, our Texas Park offers a gift shop, a covered individual and group dining area, several party rooms for rental, and a playground for young children and families. During our 2023 fiscal year, we anticipate the completion and opening of a restaurant and significantly expanded food service operations at our Texas Park. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nOn February 17, 2021, two children of James Meikle, our former President and Chief Operating Officer, filed a Complaint in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada (case no. A-21-829563-C), alleging we were obligated under Mr. Meikles Employment Agreement to purchase at least $540,000 of life insurance for Mr. Meikle, who passed away on November 28, 2018. The Complaint was seeking damages of $540,000, as well as interest and expenses. The trial date was set for August 15, 2022. Effective August 5, 2022, we agreed to pay the plaintiffs $100,000 to settle this Compliant and obtain a full release for any related complaints. The release was completed August 26, 2022, we issued payment for the settlement amount on August 31, 2022 and an order of dismissal was filed on September 19, 2022.\nOther Matters\nExcept as noted above, we are not a party to any pending legal proceeding, nor are any of our properties the subject of a pending legal proceeding, that is not in the ordinary course of business or otherwise material to the financial condition of its business. None of our directors, officers or affiliates is involved in a proceeding adverse to our business or has a material interest adverse to our business. ITEM 4.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition (MD&A) is a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and provides additional information on our businesses, current developments, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022 provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain statements contained herein may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, as discussed more fully herein.\nThe forward-looking information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is based on managements current views and assumptions regarding future events, and speak only as of the date of this report. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting these forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States and the rules and regulations of the SEC. More information about potential factors that could affect our business and financial results is included in the section entitled Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nThrough our wholly owned subsidiaries, we own and operate three regional theme parks and are in the business of acquiring, developing and operating local and regional theme parks and attractions in the United States. Our wholly owned subsidiaries are Wild Animal Safari, Inc., a Georgia corporation (Wild Animal - Georgia), Wild Animal, Inc., a Missouri corporation (Wild Animal - Missouri), and Aggieland-Parks, Inc., a Texas corporation (Aggieland Wild Animal - Texas). Wild Animal - Georgia owns and operates the Wild Animal Safari theme park in Pine Mountain, Georgia (the Georgia Park). Wild Animal - Missouri owns and operates the Wild Animal Safari theme park located in Strafford, Missouri (the Missouri Park). Aggieland Wild Animal - Texas owns and operates the Aggieland Wild Animal Safari theme park near Bryan/College Station, Texas (the Texas Park). On April 27, 2020, we acquired substantially all the assets of Aggieland Safari LLC and related entities (Aggieland Safari).\nOur parks are open year round, but experience increased seasonal attendance, typically beginning in the latter half of March through early September. Combined third and fourth quarter net sales were 62.1% and 60.3% of annual attendance based net sales for our 2022 and 2021 fiscal years, respectively. Since the acquisition of our Texas Park, the combined third and fourth quarter concentration of our sales has been reduced.\nThe table below outlines our annual net sales, reported and adjusted income before income taxes, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and net cash provided by operating activities for the last five fiscal years. For the past several years, our Georgia Park has benefitted from a number of positive factors including strong and stable management, the addition of online ticket sales in June 2015, growth and positive economic conditions in the greater Atlanta area, as well as positive guest perceptions of this park. Our strong results through fiscal 2019 and the resulting improvements in our financial position provided us with the resources to pursue and ultimately complete the Aggieland Safari acquisition.\nFiscal Year\n2019\nTotal net sales $ 10,741,417 $ 11,862,491 $ 9,507,264 $ 6,184,254 $ 6,046,758\n% change -9.5 % 24.8 % 53.7 % 2.3 % -3.1 %\nReported income before income taxes 1,030,291 3,680,546 3,693,869 1,495,438 1,422,592\n% change -72.0 % -0.4 % 147.0 % 5.1 % -30.1 %\n% of total net sales 9.6 % 31.0 % 38.9 % 24.2 % 23.5 %\nAdjusted income before income taxes (*) 1,130,291 3,490,558 3,669,496 1,575,882 1,553,124\n% change -67.6 % -4.9 % 132.9 % 1.5 % -20.6 %\n% of total net sales 10.5 % 29.4 % 38.6 % 25.5 % 25.7 %\nEBITDA 2,168,161 4,620,623 4,457,682 2,138,546 2,188,851\n% change -53.1 % 3.7 % 108.4 % -2.3 % -17.1 %\n% of total net sales 20.2 % 39.0 % 46.9 % 34.6 % 36.2 %\nNet cash provided by operating activities 1,540,719 3,308,718 3,680,401 1,858,158 1,767,243\n% change -53.4 % -10.1 % 98.1 % 5.1 % -3.3 %\n% of total net sales 14.3 % 27.9 % 38.7 % 30.0 % 29.2 %\n* - Excludes a $100,000 legal settlement charge in 2022, a $189,988 gain on extinguishment of debt in 2021, $24,373 of tornado related insurance proceeds in 2020, $80,444 of tornado damage asset write-offs and costs in 2019, and $130,532 of deferred financing costs write-offs in 2018.\nEBITDA is not a measurement of operating performance computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered as a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe that EBITDA is a meaningful measure as it is widely used by analysts, investors and comparable companies in our industry to evaluate our operating performance on a consistent basis, as well as more easily compare our results with those of other companies in our industry. We also believe EBITDA is a meaningful measure of park-level operating profitability. EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our operating results and is not intended to be a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operating activities as defined under GAAP.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of our reported income before income taxes to our EBITDA for our five most recent fiscal years:\nFiscal Year\n2019\nReported income before income taxes $ 1,030,291 $ 3,680,546 $ 3,693,869 $ 1,495,438 $ 1,422,592\nInterest expense 261,621 335,944 182,926 76,003 177,828\nDepreciation and amortization 782,987 704,016 576,139 453,968 425,647\n(Gain) loss on disposal of operating assets, net (6,738 ) 90,105 29,121 32,693 32,252\nLegal settlement 100,000 - - - -\nGain on extinguishment of debt - (189,988 ) - - -\nTornado damage and expenses, net - - (24,373 ) 80,444 -\nWrite-off of loan fees - prepayment - - - - 130,532\nEBITDA $ 2,168,161 $ 4,620,623 $ 4,457,682 $ 2,138,546 $ 2,188,851\nIn response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental authorities throughout the United States implemented a variety of containment measures with the objective of slowing the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns. We implemented several measures to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on our business and financial position. During the initial shutdown period, we reduced staffing, applied for and received Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and reduced discretionary spending. In addition, we delayed closing the Texas Park acquisition to renegotiate various terms, primarily focused on reducing the cash requirements of the acquisition in the subsequent year.\nIn early April 2020, our Georgia and Missouri Parks closed to the public due to shelter-in-place mandates. In addition, our Texas Park, was closed to the public for the month prior to its acquisition, due to a shelter-in-place mandate. In compliance with respective state issued guidelines, each of our parks reopened in early May 2020. After reopening, attendance levels increased significantly at each of our parks for the balance of our 2020 fiscal year, which continued throughout our 2021 fiscal year in comparison to comparable pre-COVID-19 periods. We experienced a decline in comparable year-over-year attendance based net sales and attendance for the last 22 weeks of our 2021 fiscal year and for our entire 2022 fiscal year, respectively.\nWhile we experienced a comparable 52-week attendance-based sales decline for our 2022 fiscal year compared to the elevated pandemic levels, our overall sales remain at significantly higher levels when compared to pre-COVID-19 periods. On a combined basis, attendance-based sales of our Georgia and Missouri Parks for our 2022 fiscal year were up approximately 43.0% compared to the comparable pre-COVID-19 2019 fiscal year, which we believe illustrates a significant increase in local and regional awareness of each park, a critical development with positive long-term ramifications for our business. (Note, our Texas Park, acquired on April 27, 2020, originally opened in May 2019; therefore, a full year of sales is not available for pre-COVID-19 periods).\nAlthough we have experienced attendance gains and strong cash flows subsequent to the reopening our of parks after the initial closures at the beginning of the pandemic, there may be longer-term negative impacts to the Companys business, results of operations and cash flows, and financial condition as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative impacts may include changes in customer behavior and preferences, increases in operating expenses to meet consumer expectations and perceptions, limitations in our ability to recruit and maintain staffing, as well as increasing wages required retain and recruit staff. There is also the potential for attendance levels at our parks to moderate or decline as alternative entertainment venues are now open and consumers have broader travel and entertainment options.\nWe are committed to leveraging the strong operating model we have established at our Georgia Park at all three of our properties, with a focus on increasing attendance through enhanced marketing efforts and focused capital investments, as well as continuing to prudently increase the average revenue generated per guest visit via concession and gift shop revenues. Among our highest priorities over the next several years is continuing the integration of our Texas Park, continual enhancement of the overall guest experience at each of our parks, as well as the introduction new programming and enhanced marketing efforts. As our Texas Park first opened to the public in May 2019, we believe there remains tremendous potential to increase attendance by increasing the local and regional awareness of this facility via advertising and promotion. We are pleased with the expanded attendance at our Missouri Park since it reopened in May 2020 and plan on leveraging the increased exposure of this facility to continue to build on this recent success.\nOur 2023 fiscal year capital investment plan remains elevated versus historical levels, however, is lower than the $1.84 million record level of capital spending during our 2022 fiscal year. Our 2023 capital plan targets substantial guest-facing enhancements at all three of our parks, delivering a marketable attraction at each property and setting the stage for longer-term master planning and optimization at every park. Our plan to open a significant new giraffe exhibit at our Georgia Park during our 2022 fiscal year experienced delays due to a highly inflationary period for building materials and a challenging labor market. We remain committed to this showcase attraction and expect to make progress on this project during our 2023 fiscal year, however the opening date is still unknown. Our 2023 projected capital investment spending will again be fully funded from our existing cash and continues to demonstrate our commitment to building for long-term, sustainable growth.\nOur long-term business plan also includes expansion via the acquisition of additional local or regional theme parks and attractions. We believe acquisitions, if any, should not unnecessarily encumber the Company with additional debt that cannot be justified by current operations. We may also pursue contract management opportunities for themed attractions owned by third parties. By using a combination of equity, debt and other financing options, we intend to carefully monitor stockholder value in conjunction with the pursuit of growth.\nStrong annual operating cash flow over the past several fiscal years has provided us with incremental cash flow, provided us with the financial strength to complete the Aggieland Safari acquisition and has funded a significant increase in capital investment. However, our current size and operating model leave us little room for error. Any future capital raised by us is likely to result in dilution to existing stockholders. It is possible that cash generated by, or available to, us may not be sufficient to fund our capital and liquidity needs for the near-term.\nConsolidated and Segment Results of Operations for the Year Ended October 2, 2022 as Compared to the Year Ended October 3, 2021\nWe manage our operations on an individual location basis. Discrete financial information is maintained for each park and provided to our corporate management for review and as a basis for decision-making. The primary performance measures used to allocate resources are Park earnings before interest and tax expense, and free cash flow. We use this measure of operating profit to gauge segment performance because we believe this measure is the most indicative of performance trends and the overall earnings potential of each segment.\nOur 2022 fiscal year was comprised of 52-weeks, compared to our 2021 fiscal year which was comprised of 53-weeks. Therefore, in addition to full year reported attendance based sales comparisons, attendance based sales analyses will include comparable 52-week sales comparisons.\nThe following table shows our consolidated and segment operating results for the years ended October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021:\nGeorgia Park Missouri Park Texas Park Consolidated\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\nTotal net sales $ 7,086,232 $ 8,067,808 $ 1,691,602 $ 1,792,112 $ 1,963,583 $ 2,002,571 $ 10,741,417 $ 11,862,491\nSegment income (loss) from operations 2,895,820 4,517,649 (344,404 ) 202,597 (254,834 ) (62,922 ) 2,296,582 4,657,324\nSegment operating margin % 40.9 % 56.0 % -20.4 % 11.3 % -13.0 % -3.1 % 21.4 % 39.3 %\nCorporate expenses\n(995,946 ) (896,136 )\nOther income, net\n91,276 65,314\nLegal settlement\n(100,000 ) -\nGain on extinguishment of debt\n- 189,988\nInterest expense\n(261,621 ) (335,944 )\nIncome before income taxes\n$ 1,030,291 $ 3,680,546\nTotal Net Sales\nThe Companys total net sales for the year ended October 2, 2022 decreased by $1.12 million, to $10.74 million compared to $11.86 million for the year ended October 3, 2021. Our Parks combined attendance based net sales decreased by $1.05 million or 9.0%, and animal sales decreased by $75,607. On a comparable 52-week basis, our attendance based net sales decreased by $848,862 or 7.4%.\nOn a reported basis, our Georgia Parks attendance based net sales decreased by $881,252 or 11.1%, to $7.07 million, our Missouri Parks attendance based net sales decreased by $101,592 or 5.7%, to $1.67 million, and our Texas Parks attendance based sales decreased by $62,623 or 3.2%, to $1.88 million.\nOn a comparable 52-week basis, our Georgia Parks attendance based net sales decreased by $748,701 or 9.6%, our Missouri Parks attendance based net sales decreased by $76,473 or 4.4%, and our Texas Parks attendance based sales decreased by $23,688 or 1.2%. On comparable 52-week basis, paid attendance at our Georgia Park decreased by approximately 17.9%, paid attendance our Missouri Park decreased by approximately 15.7%, while paid attendance at our Texas Park increased by approximately 2.2%.\nSegment Operating Margin\nOur consolidated segment operating margin decreased $2.36 million, resulting in segment income from operations of $2.30 million for the year ended October 2, 2022 compared to segment income from operations of $4.66 million for the year ended October 3, 2021. Our Georgia Parks segment income was $2.90 million, a decrease of $1.62 million, principally attributable to lower attendance based net sales and lower animal sales, as well as higher compensation and benefits, advertising, insurance and general operating expenses, partially offset by higher margins on gift shop and food service sales. Our Missouri Park generated a segment operating loss of $344,404, a net decrease of $547,001, primarily attributable to lower attendance based net sales, as well as higher special event, advertising, compensation, depreciation and general operating expenses, partially offset by gains on asset dispositions. Our Texas Park generated a segment loss of $254,834, an increase of $191,912, primarily attributable lower attendance based net sales, as well as higher advertising, benefits, insurance, depreciation and general operating expenses, partially offset by higher animal sales, higher margins on gift shop and food service sales, and lower losses on asset dispositions.\nCorporate Expenses\nCorporate spending increased by $99,810 to $995,946 during the year ended October 2, 2022, primarily due to higher professional fees, compensation and benefits, travel and insurance expenses.\nLegal Settlement Charge\nEffective August 5, 2022, we agreed to pay $100,000 to two children of a former officer of the Company to settle a complaint alleging we were obligated to purchase life insurance of at least $540,000 for said officer. The release was obtained, and the full payment was made prior to October 2, 2022. For additional information, see Note 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net, was $91,276 for the year ended October 2, 2022, an increase of $25,962, primarily attributable to higher mineral rights royalty income for our Texas Park.\nGain on Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the year ended October 3, 2021, we received notification the SBA approved both of our PPP loan forgiveness applications, resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt totaling $189,988.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the year ended October 2, 2022 was $261,621, a decrease of $74,323, primarily as a result of the lower interest rate associated with the June 2021 refinancing of our Synovus term loan and scheduled principal payments on our term loans over the trailing 12 month period, as well as the retirement of the Aggieland Seller Note in June 2021.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the year ended October 2, 2022, we generated income before income taxes of $1.03 million and recorded a tax provision of $302,800, for an effective tax rate of approximately 29.4%, which was unfavorably impacted by state income taxes due to operating losses for our Missouri and Texas Parks. For the year ended October 3, 2021, we generated income before income taxes of $3.68 million and recorded a tax provision of $882,000, for an effective tax rate of approximately 24.0%, which was favorably impacted by the non-taxable PPP loan forgiveness. For additional information, see Note 7. Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNet Income and Income Per Share\nOur reported net income for the year ended October 2, 2022 was $727,491 or $0.01 per basic share and per fully diluted share, a decrease of $2.07 million or $0.03 per basic and fully diluted share, as compared with reported net income of $2.80 million or $0.04 per basic share and per fully diluted share, for the year ended October 3, 2021.\nFor the year ended\nOctober 2, 2022 October 3, 2021\nNet income $ 727,491 $ 2,798,546\nLegal settlement 100,000 -\nTax impact - legal settlement (27,000 ) -\nGain on extinguishment of debt - (189,988 )\nAdjusted net income $ 800,491 $ 2,608,558\nAs shown in the table above, several one-time items impacted our year-over-year reported net income comparison. Our 2022 fiscal year included a legal settlement charge of $100,000. Our 2021 fiscal year included a gain on extinguishment of debt totaling $189,988. Management believes that adjusted net income, excluding one-time items, should be considered in evaluating the ongoing operating performance of our business. Excluding the after-tax effect of these items, our 2022 and 2021 fiscal year adjusted net income would have been $800,491 and $2.61 million, respectively, resulting in a decrease in adjusted net income of $1.81 million. The decrease in our adjusted net income is attributable to a $1.62 million decrease in the segment income for our Georgia Park, a $547,001 net decline in the segment income for our Missouri Park, a $191,912 increase in the segment loss for our Texas Park, a $99,810 increase in Corporate expenses, partially offset by a $74,323 decrease in interest expense, a $25,962 increase in other income and a $552,200 decrease in our adjusted income tax provision.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash generated by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements. Historically, our slow season starts after Labor Day in September and runs until Spring Break, which typically begins toward the end of March. The first and second quarters of our fiscal year have historically generated negative cash flow, requiring us to use cash generated from prior fiscal years, as well as borrowing on a seasonal basis, to fund operations and prepare our Parks for the busy season during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. As a result of our improved cash position, during our 2022 and 2021 fiscal years we did not utilize any seasonal borrowing.\nOn June 18, 2021, we entered a new $1.95 million, seven-year term loan (the 2021 Term Loan) with Synovus Bank (Synovus), at an annual interest rate of 3.75%. The 2021 Term Loan replaced our 2018 borrowing facility with Synovus Bank, which included a term loan in the original principal amount of $1.60 million at 5.00% per annum and a $350,000 line of credit at 4.75% per annum. After paying off the balance outstanding on the 2018 Term Loan, the net additional borrowings on the 2021 Term Loan were $930,222 and the line of credit was not renewed. Combined with available cash, we used the incremental proceeds from the 2021 Term Loan to paydown $1.0 million of the 2020 Term Loan used to finance our Texas Park acquisition, which has a 5.00% annual interest rate. Overall, we estimate this refinancing will generate approximately $24,375 in annual interest savings.\nOur working capital was $4.67 million as of October 2, 2022, compared to $5.70 million as of October 3, 2021. The year-over-year decrease in working capital primarily reflects cash used for capital investments and scheduled term loan payments, partially offset by cash generated by operating activities during our 2022 fiscal year.\nTotal loan debt, including current maturities, as of October 2, 2022 was $4.96 million compared to $5.66 million as of October 3, 2021. The year-over-year decrease in total loan debt the result scheduled term loan payments during our 2022 fiscal year.\nAs of October 2, 2022, we had equity of $15.35 million and total loan debt of $4.96 million, resulting in a debt to equity ratio of 0.32 to 1.0, compared to 0.39 to 1.0 as of October 3, 2021.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.54 million for our 2022 fiscal year, compared to $3.31 million, for our 2021 fiscal year, resulting in a decrease of $1.77 million, principally due to lower net income.\nInvesting Activities\nOur 2022 fiscal year included $1.84 million of capital improvements, compared to $988,901 spent on capital improvements during our 2021 fiscal year, representing an increase of $850,490.\nDuring our 2022 fiscal year, property and equipment investing at our Georgia Park included various animal acquisitions, additions to animal shelters and exhibits, the addition of a guest party pavilion, enhancements to and expansion of our food service capabilities, improvements to our gift shop, annual improvements to our drive-through roads, and spending on annual requirements for our rental vehicle fleet. For our Missouri Park, 2022 fiscal year property and equipment investments included various animal acquisitions, the addition of a new otter exhibit scheduled to open in our 2023 fiscal year, renovations of various animal shelters and exhibits, ground and electrical improvements to support a new Christmas Lights display, enhancements to and expansion of our food service capabilities, the addition of playground equipment in the walkabout section, and the acquisition of various equipment. For our Texas Park, 2022 fiscal year property and equipment investments included various animal acquisitions, the addition of and enhancements to various animal shelters, the acquisition of several vehicles for customer rental and related service equipment, other equipment additions, and various improvements focused on introducing expanded food service operations, expected to fully launch in fiscal 2023.\nDuring our 2021 fiscal year, property and equipment investing at our Georgia Park included improvements to our drive-through road and other infrastructure improvements, various improvements to our concession and food service capabilities, improvements and additions to animal shelters and exhibits, spending on annual requirements for our rental vehicle fleet, and the acquisition of various animals. For our Missouri Park, 2021 fiscal year property and equipment investments included improvements and additions to animal shelters and exhibits, the acquisition of various animals, fencing improvements, improvements to our gift shop, and the acquisition of various equipment. For our Texas Park, 2021 fiscal year property and equipment investments included improvements to animal shelters and exhibits, the acquisition of various park equipment, drive through road improvements, and the acquisition of various animals.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $866,193 for the year ended October 2, 2022, compared to $1.20 million for the year ended October 3, 2021, resulting in a decrease of $333,969.\nDuring our 2022 fiscal year, cash used in financing activities was for scheduled payments on our term loans, as well as principal payments on a financing lease obligation prior to its termination in September 2022.\nIn June 2021, we entered into the 2021 Term Loan for $1.95 million, using those proceeds to pay off the $1.02 million outstanding balance of our 2018 Term Loan. Combined with additional cash, we used the net remaining proceeds of the 2021 Term Loan to prepay $1.0 million against our 2020 Term Loan. In addition, on June 29, 2021, we paid off the $750,000 Aggieland Safari Seller Note. Excluding the $1.0 million prepayment of the 2020 Term Loan, net principal payments against our combined term loans totaled $448,648 for the year ended October 3, 2021.\nBorrowing Agreements\nOn June 18, 2021, through our wholly owned subsidiary Wild Animal - Georgia, we completed a refinancing transaction (the 2021 Refinancing) with Synovus Bank. The 2021 Refinancing included a term loan in the original principal amount of $1.95 million. The 2021 Term Loan bears interest at a rate of 3.75% per annum and is payable in monthly installments of approximately $26,480, based on a seven-year amortization period. The 2021 Term Loan has a maturity date of June 18, 2028. The 2021 Term Loan is secured by a security deed on the assets of Wild Animal - Georgia. We paid a total of approximately $1,514 in fees and expenses in connection with the 2021 Refinancing. The outstanding balance of the 2021 Term Loan was$1.64 million as of October 2, 2022.\nOn April 27, 2020, through our wholly owned subsidiary Aggieland-Parks Inc., we acquired Aggieland Wild Animal - Texas. This acquisition was financed with the 2020 Term Loan from First Financial Bank (First Financial) and the Aggieland Seller Note (as defined below). The 2020 Term Loan in the original principal amount of $5.0 million from First Financial is secured by substantially all the Aggieland Wild Animal - Texas assets, as well as guarantees from the Company and its subsidiaries. The 2020 Term Loan bears interest at a rate of 5.0% per annum, has a maturity date of April 27, 2031, and required interest only monthly payments through April 2021. The 2020 Term Loan requires monthly payments of approximately $53,213 beginning in May 2021. We paid a total of approximately $62,375 in fees and expenses in connection with the 2020 Term Loan. On June 30, 2021, the Company used the incremental proceeds of the 2021 Term Loan, combined with additional funds, to paydown $1.0 million against the 2020 Term Loan, which had an outstanding balance of $3.37 million as of October 2, 2022.\nThe Aggieland Seller Note represented a deferred portion of the purchase price, had a face value of $750,000, bore no interest, had a maturity date of June 30, 2021, and was secured by a second priority subordinated lien and security interest in the acquired mineral rights and the animal inventory. We applied a 2.5% discount rate to determine a fair value of $728,500 for the Aggieland Seller Note as of April 27, 2020 and the resulting $21,500 discount was amortized as interest expense over the 14 month period of the note. On June 29, 2021, the Company paid off the Aggieland Seller Note.\nOn July 11, 2018, through our wholly owned subsidiary Wild Animal - Georgia, we completed a refinancing transaction (the 2018 Refinancing) with Synovus. The 2018 Refinancing included a term loan in the original principal amount of $1.6 million (the 2018 Term Loan). The 2018 Term Loan had an interest rate of 5.0% per annum and was payable in monthly payments of approximately $22,672, based on a seven-year amortization period. The 2018 Term Loan had a maturity date of June 11, 2021, with an option to renew at 5.0% per annum for an additional 49-month term. The 2018 Term Loan was secured by a security deed on the assets of Wild Animal - Georgia. We paid a total of approximately $15,680 in fees and expenses in connection with the 2018 Refinancing. The 2021 Term Loan replaced our 2018 Term Loan with Synovus, which had an outstanding balance of $1.02 million, and was paid off with the proceeds of the 2021 Term Loan.\nAs a result of the significant negative economic impacts and uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Wild Animal - Georgia and Wild Animal - Missouri each applied for PPP loans. On April 14, 2020 and April 16, 2020, we received two unsecured PPP loans totaling $188,087. The PPP was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the SBA). The term of the PPP loans was two years, with an interest rate of 1.0% per annum. All payments were deferred for the first twelve months of these PPP loans, with accrued interest being added to the principal during the payment deferral period. Under the terms of the CARES Act, some or all the PPP loan proceeds were eligible to be forgiven, based on use for specified purposes, subject to limitations and ongoing rulemaking by the SBA. We applied for forgiveness of the full amount of both the Wild Animal - Georgia and Wild Animal - Missouri PPP loans in March 2021. Effective March 29, 2021 and May 25, 2021, the SBA approved the Forgiveness Applications for Wild Animal - Georgia and Wild Animal - Missouri, respectively, including forgiveness of accrued interest, resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt totaling $189,988 during the year ended October 3, 2021.\nSubsequent Events\nEffective November 14, 2022, Lisa Brady was appointed as the Companys President and CEO, replacing Dale Van Voorhis, who had been serving as interim President and CEO since June 1, 2022. Among other duties, Ms. Brady is responsible for leading the day-to-day operations of the Company, evaluating and recommending strategic initiatives, as well as working with the management team to implement and execute approved strategic growth initiatives. Mr. Van Voorhis will continue as Chairman of the Companys Board of Directors and as a special advisor to Ms. Brady.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our significant accounting policies are set forth in NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTNG POLICIES of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial position. Our critical accounting policies are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company.\nThe preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to long-lived assets, revenue recognition, income taxes, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although actual results historically have not deviated significantly from those determined using our estimates, our results of operations or financial condition could differ, perhaps materially, from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nLong-lived Assets, including Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life, increase capacity or improve the efficiency of the assets. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided on the straight-line method and is based on the estimated useful economic lives of the respective assets. We make subjective assessments as to these useful lives for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record annually with respect to our investments in property and equipment. These assessments have a direct impact on our net income or loss, as a change in the estimated useful economic lives of our investments in property and equipment would increase or decrease depreciation expense, thereby decreasing or increasing net income or loss. We review long-lived assets whenever circumstances change such that the recorded value of an asset may not be recoverable and therefore impaired.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues when a performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring control of promised services or products to our guests/customers in an amount that reflects the amount we have received or expect to receive in exchange for those services or products. Park admission revenues for annual passes and memberships are deferred and recognized as revenue on a pro-rata basis over the term of the pass or membership. Park admission fee revenues from advance online ticket purchases are deferred until the customers visit to the parks. Advance online tickets can generally be used anytime during the one year period from the date of purchase. Revenues from retail and concession sales are generally recognized upon the concurrent receipt of payment and delivery of goods to the customer. Sales taxes billed and collected are not included in revenue.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement amounts and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We review our deferred tax assets to determine whether their value can be realized based upon available evidence. A valuation allowance is established when we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision or benefit for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We record deferred tax assets, primarily resulting from net operating loss carry-forwards to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. In the event we determine it is more likely than not we will not realize our deferred tax assets we establish a valuation allowance.\nContingencies\nWe have various contingencies, as described in NOTE 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are not aware of any other legal matters involving the Company, however, there can be no assurance that all proceedings that may currently be brought against us are known by us at this time. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot applicable ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nOur financial statements and related notes are set forth at pages through. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWith the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of Parks! America (the Registrant), the Registrants management has evaluated the effectiveness of the Registrants disclosure controls and procedures, as required by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, the Registrants principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Registrants disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(b) Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOverview\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and includes those policies and procedures that:\n1. Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce this risk.\nManagement based its assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its assessment, management has concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective as of October 2, 2022.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act, during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting as of October 2, 2022.

America, Inc.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Parks! America, Inc. (the Company) as of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAssessment of Impairment on Long Lived Assets\nAs described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, the Companys long-lived tangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. If such conditions are present, the Company determines if the assets are recoverable by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows to the assets carrying amounts. If the carrying amounts are greater, then the assets are not recoverable.\nWe identified the Companys recoverability analyses of long lived assets as a critical audit matter because of the operating losses at the Missouri and Texas parks and the significant judgments made by management to estimate the recoverability of these groups of assets. A high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort was required when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of managements estimates and assumptions.\nOur audit procedures related to the recoverability analyses of these long-lived asset groups included obtaining an understanding and evaluating the procedures and assumptions utilized in managements recoverability analyses. To test the Companys estimated future undiscounted cash flow analyses, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing significant assumptions and the underlying data used by the Company in its recoverability analyses, and evaluating the methodologies applied by management.\n/s/ GBQ Partners LLC\nGBQ Partners LLC\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2020.\nColumbus, Ohio\nDecember 15, 2022\nPARKS!

AMERICA, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOctober 2, 2022\nNOTE 1. ORGANIZATION\nParks! America, Inc. (Parks! or the Company) owns and operates through wholly owned subsidiaries three regional theme parks and is in the business of acquiring, developing and operating local and regional theme parks and attractions in the United States. The Companys wholly owned subsidiaries are Wild Animal Safari, Inc. a Georgia corporation (Wild Animal - Georgia), Wild Animal, Inc., a Missouri corporation (Wild Animal - Missouri), and Aggieland-Parks, Inc., a Texas corporation (Aggieland Wild Animal - Texas). Wild Animal - Georgia owns and operates the Wild Animal Safari theme park in Pine Mountain, Georgia (the Georgia Park). Wild Animal - Missouri owns and operates the Wild Animal Safari theme park located in Strafford, Missouri (the Missouri Park). Aggieland Wild Animal - Texas owns and operates the Aggieland Wild Animal Safari theme park near Bryan/College Station, Texas (the Texas Park). The Company acquired the Georgia Park on June 13, 2005, the Missouri Park on March 5, 2008, and the Texas Park on April 27, 2020.\nThe Company was originally incorporated on July 30, 1954 as Painted Desert Uranium & Oil Co., Inc. in Washington State. On October 1, 2002, Painted Desert Uranium & Oil Co., Inc. changed its name to Royal Pacific Resources, Inc. and its corporate domicile to the State of Nevada. On December 19, 2003, Royal Pacific Resources, Inc. acquired the assets of Great Western Parks LLC pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement that resulted in the Company assuming control and changing the corporate name to Great American Family Parks, Inc. The acquisition was accounted for as a reverse acquisition in which Great Western Parks was considered the acquirer of Royal Pacific Resources for reporting purposes. On June 11, 2008, the Company changed its name from Great American Family Parks, Inc. to Parks! America, Inc.\nThe Companys Parks are open year round, but experience increased seasonal attendance, typically beginning in the latter half of March through early September. Combined third and fourth quarter attendance based net sales were 62.1% and 60.3% of annual attendance based net sales for the Companys 2022 and 2021 fiscal years, respectively.\nCOVID-19 Considerations\nIn response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental authorities throughout the United States implemented a variety of containment measures with the objective of slowing the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns. The Company implemented several measures to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on our business and financial position. During the initial shutdown period, the Company reduced staffing, applied for and received Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and reduced discretionary spending. In addition, the Company delayed closing the Texas Park acquisition to renegotiate various terms, primarily focused on reducing the cash requirements of the acquisition in the subsequent year.\nIn early April 2020, the Companys Georgia and Missouri Parks closed to the public due to shelter-in-place mandates. In addition, the Companys Texas Park, was closed to the public for the month prior to its acquisition, due to a shelter-in-place mandate. In compliance with respective state issued guidelines, each of the Companys parks reopened in early May 2020. After reopening, attendance levels increased significantly at each of the Companys parks for the balance of its 2020 fiscal year, which continued throughout its 2021 fiscal year in comparison to comparable pre-COVID-19 periods. While attendance based net sales remain higher compared to comparable pre-COVID-19 periods, the Company experienced a decline in comparable year-over-year attendance based net sales and attendance for the last 22 weeks of its 2021 fiscal year and for its entire 2022 fiscal year, respectively.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates, the Companys future operations are dependent on factors outside of managements knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of this pandemic or similar public health risks. Although we have experienced attendance gains and strong cash flows subsequent to reopening our parks after the initial closures at the beginning of the pandemic, there may be longer-term negative impacts to the Companys business, results of operations and cash flows, and financial condition as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative impacts may include changes in customer behavior and preferences, increases in operating expenses to meet consumer expectations and perceptions, limitations in our ability to recruit and maintain staffing, as well as increasing wages required retain and recruit staff. There is also the potential for attendance levels at our parks to moderate or decline as alternative entertainment venues are now open and consumers have broader travel and entertainment options. There is also the possibility that one, or a combination of these risk factors, may a material negative impact on the Companys business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nPARKS! AMERICA, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOctober 2, 2022\nNOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation: The Companys consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The information reflects all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the Companys financial position and results of its operations for the periods set forth herein.\nPrinciples of Consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries (Wild Animal - Georgia, Wild Animal - Missouri and Aggieland Wild Animal - Texas). All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nAccounting Method: The Company recognizes income and expenses based on the accrual method of accounting.\nEstimates and Assumptions: Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Actual results could vary from the estimates that were assumed in preparing these financial statements.\nFiscal Year End: The Companys fiscal year-end is the Sunday closest to September 30, and its quarterly close dates are also determined by the Sunday closest to the end of each quarterly reporting period. For the 2022 fiscal year, October 2 was the closest Sunday, and for the 2021 fiscal year, October 3 was the closest Sunday. The 2022 fiscal year was comprised of 52-weeks, while the 2021 fiscal year was comprised of 53-weeks. This fiscal calendar aligns the Companys fiscal periods closely with the seasonality of its business. The high season typically ends after the Labor Day holiday weekend. The period from October through early March is geared towards maintenance and preparation for the next busy season, which typically begins at Spring Break and runs through Labor Day.\nBusiness Combinations: The Company accounts for acquisitions in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations. In purchase accounting, identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, are recognized at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, and any remaining purchase price is recorded as goodwill. In determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company makes significant estimates and assumptions, particularly with respect to long-lived tangible and intangible assets. Critical estimates used in valuing tangible and intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, discount rates, market prices and asset lives. Although estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, actual results may differ.\nFinancial and Concentrations Risk: The Company does not have any concentration or related financial credit risks. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts, which at times may exceed federally insured limits.\nFair Value: Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, or an exit price. Inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value may be observable or unobservable, and valuation techniques used to measure fair value should maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels based on the ranks of the quality and reliability of inputs used to determine the fair values. Level 1 inputs consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs consist of quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and market-corroborated inputs which are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable. A financial instruments categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis include our term debt.\nAccounts Receivable: The theme parks are primarily a payment upfront business; therefore, the Company typically carries little or no accounts receivable. The Company had accounts receivable of $4,405 and $4,469 as of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively.\nPARKS!

Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method. The gross profit method is used to determine the change in gift shop inventory for interim periods. Inventories are reviewed and reconciled annually because inventory levels turn over rapidly. The Company had inventory of $541,986 and $314,103 as of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to thirty-nine years.

Amortization expense for the years ended October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021 totaled $16,128 and $0, respectively.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets: The Company reviews its major assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If an asset is considered impaired, then impairment will be recognized in an amount determined by the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value.\nOther Current Liabilities: The following is a breakdown of other current liabilities:\nSCHEDULE OF OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES\nOctober 2, 2022 October 3, 2021\nDeferred revenue $ 193,912 $ 242,318\nAccrued wages and payroll taxes 122,265 81,160\nAccrued sales taxes 49,123 64,396\nAccrued property taxes 46,814 47,517\nOther accrued liabilities 109,758 95,956\nOther current liabilities $ 521,872 $ 531,347\nPARKS! AMERICA, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOctober 2, 2022\nNOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenues in accordance with ASC 606, Revenues from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocation the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that it will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.\nRevenues from park admission fees are recognized at the point in time control transfers to the customer, which is generally when the customer accepts access to the park and the Company is entitled to payment. Park admission revenues for annual passes and memberships are deferred and recognized as revenue on a pro-rata basis over the term of the pass or membership. Park admission fee revenues from advance online ticket purchases are deferred until the customers visit to the parks. Advance online tickets can generally be used anytime during the one year period from the date of purchase. Revenues from retail and concession sales are generally recognized upon the concurrent receipt of payment and delivery of goods to the customer. Sales taxes billed and collected are not included in revenue.\nDeferred revenues from advance online admission tickets, and season passes, and memberships were $193,912 and $242,318 as of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively, and is included within Other Current Liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company periodically sells surplus animals created from the natural breeding process that occurs within the parks. All animal sales are reported as a separate revenue line item. Animal sales are recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer, which is generally determined when title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer, all of which generally occurs upon delivery of the animal. Based on the Companys assessment of control indicators, sales are recognized when animals are delivered to the customer.\nThe Company provides disaggregation of revenue based on geography in Note 9: Business Segments, as it believes this best depicts how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nAdvertising and Marketing Costs: The Company expenses advertising and marketing costs as incurred. Advertising and marketing expense for the years ended October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021 totaled $1,238,618 and $977,562, respectively.\nLeases: The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception and accounts for all leases in accordance with ASC 842, Leases. If an arrangement contains a lease, the Company performs a classification test to determine if the lease is an operating lease or a financing lease. Right of use assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right of use assets are valued at the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any indirect costs or rent prepayments, and reduced by any lease incentives and any deferred lease payments. Right of use assets are amortized over the lease term. Lease liabilities are recognized on the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is the Companys incremental borrowing rate, unless the rate implicit in the lease is readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease, unless management believes there is an alternative systematic basis which better represents the pattern which the Company will consume the economic benefits thereof and is included within general and administrative expenses. As a practical expedient, a relief provided in the accounting standard to simplify compliance, the Company does not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with an original term of one year or less. Any non-lease components are not included within the lease right-of-use asset and lease liability, are reflected as an expense in the period incurred.\nPARKS! AMERICA, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOctober 2, 2022\nNOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nIn October 2021, the Company entered a financing lease for certain property related to a Christmas Lights drive through display at its Missouri Park. Effective September 27, 2022, the Company terminated this financing lease, acquiring the leased property related to the Christmas Lights display for $85,000 in exchange for a mutual release of obligations under the lease agreement and recognized a lease termination gain of $2,011. Prior to termination of the lease, during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022 the Company recognized right of use asset amortization and interest expense related to this lease of $154,831 and $6,032, respectively.\nPaycheck Protection Program Loan Accounting Policy: Currently, there is no authoritative guidance under GAAP that addresses accounting and reporting by a for-profit business entity that receives forgivable debt from a government entity. Accordingly, management has elected to recognize forgivable debt received from a government entity as debt until debt extinguishment occurs when the Company is legally released from being the obligor. Upon legal release as obligor, the Company recognized the forgiven amount as income.\nStock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes stock based compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period associated with the grant. The Company awards shares to its Board of Directors for service on the Board. The shares issued to the Board are restricted and are not to be re-sold unless an exemption is available, such as the exemption afforded by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). The Company recognizes the expense based on the fair market value at time of the grant. The Company typically awards its annual Director compensation around the end of each calendar year.\nA Stock Option and Award Plan (the Plan) providing for incentive stock options and performance bonus awards for executives, employees, and directors was approved by the Companys Board of Directors on February 1, 2005, however, the Plan has not been submitted to the stockholders for approval. The Plan sets aside five million (5,000,000) shares for award of stock options, including qualified incentive stock options and performance stock bonuses. To date, no grants or awards have been made pursuant to the Plan and the Company did not submit the Plan for consideration to the Companys stockholders at its last meeting of stockholders.\nIncome Taxes: The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws. Management periodically reviews the Companys deferred tax assets to determine whether their value can be realized based on available evidence. A valuation allowance is established when management believes it is more likely than not, that such tax benefits will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the Companys income tax provision in the period of change.\nThe Company follows guidance issued by the FASB ASC 740 with respect to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more-likely-than-not test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company has no unrecognized tax benefits under guidance related to tax uncertainties. The Company does not anticipate the unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months. Any tax penalties or interest expense will be recognized in income tax expense. No interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were accrued as of October 2, 2022 or October 3, 2021.\nBasic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share: Basic net income (loss) per share amounts are computed based on the weighted average number of shares actually outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share amounts are computed using the weighted average number of common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding as if shares had been issued on the exercise any common share rights unless the exercise becomes anti-dilutive.\nBasic and diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the applicable weighted average number of common shares outstanding in each period.\nDividend Policy: The Company has not yet adopted a policy regarding payment of dividends.\nPARKS! AMERICA, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOctober 2, 2022\nNOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements:\nCredit Losses - Financial Instruments\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), which changes the impairment model for most financial assets to require measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held, replacing the existing incurred loss model. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, however, it is not anticipated to be material.\nExcept as noted, the Company does not expect recently issued accounting standards or interpretations to have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations, cash flows or financial statement disclosures.\nNOTE 3.

On April 14, 2020 and April 16, 2020, the Company received two unsecured PPP loans totaling $188,087. The PPP was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the SBA). The term of the PPP loans was two years, with an interest rate of 1.0% per annum. All payments were deferred for the first twelve months of these PPP loans, with accrued interest being added to the principal during the payment deferral period. Under the terms of the CARES Act, some or all the PPP loan proceeds were eligible to be forgiven, based on use for specified purposes, subject to limitations and ongoing rulemaking by the SBA. The Company applied for forgiveness of the full amount of both the Wild Animal - Georgia and Wild Animal - Missouri PPP loans in March 2021. Effective March 29, 2021 and May 25, 2021 the SBA approved the Forgiveness Applications for Wild Animal - Georgia and Wild Animal - Missouri, respectively, including forgiveness of accrued interest, resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt totaling $189,988, during the year ended October 3, 2021.\nInterest expense of $261,621 and $335,944 for the years ended October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively, includes $5,888 and $16,366, respectively, of debt financing costs amortization in each period.
