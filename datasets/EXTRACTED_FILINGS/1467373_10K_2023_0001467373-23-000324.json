Business 8\nPeople\nOverview\nWe are a talent- and innovation-led organization with approximately 733,000 people as of August 31, 2023, whose skills and specialization are a significant source of competitive differentiation.\nWe serve clients at any given time in more than 120 countries, with offices and operations in 49 countries. The majority of our people are in India, the Philippines and the U.S.\nWe have a culture of shared success, which is defined as success for our clients, our people, our shareholders, our partners and our communities. That culture is built upon four tangible building blocks-our beliefs, our behaviors, the way we develop and reward our people and the way we do business.\nOur Beliefs and Behaviors\nOur leadership essentials set the standard for what we expect of all our people:\nalways do the right thing, in every decision and action;\nlead with excellence, confidence and humility, as demonstrated by being a learner, building great teams and being naturally collaborative;\nexemplify client-centricity and a commitment to client value creation;\nact as a true partner, to each other, our clients, our ecosystem and our communities-committed to shared success;\ncare deeply for all our people to help them achieve their aspirations professionally and personally;\nlive our unwavering commitment to inclusion, diversity and equality, as demonstrated by personal impact and overall results;\nhave the courage to change and the ability to bring our people along the journey; and\nactively innovate-seeking new answers, applying a tech, AI and data first mindset, looking internally across Accenture and outside-to partners, competitors, start-ups, clients, academia and analysts-to learn, respectfully challenge our assumptions and apply the innovation, and cultivate and reward our people for doing the same.\nListening to the voices of our people provides the input to ensure that they have the tools and resources to do their jobs and the right learning opportunities, and that they experience a positive, respectful and inclusive work environment. We do this on an ongoing basis across various channels, including surveys and forums. One of our surveys, which was conducted in November 2022 and measures how our people experience our culture, shows that 91% of our global respondents believe they can work to their potential because they are in an environment where they are treated with respect and in an appropriate manner.\nOur purpose is to deliver on the promise of technology and human ingenuity. Our strategy is to deliver 360\u00b0 value for all our stakeholders by helping them continuously reinvent. To drive reinvention, innovation must be at the forefront, which requires us to attract, develop and inspire top talent. Talent is one of our most important areas of competitive differentiation. As part of our talent strategy, we hire and develop people who have different backgrounds, different perspectives, and different lived experiences. These differences ensure that we have and attract the cognitive diversity to deliver a variety of perspectives, observations, and insights which are essential to drive the innovation needed to reinvent. To help achieve this diversity we set goals, share them publicly, and collect data to measure our progress, continuously improve, and hold our leaders accountable for ensuring we have the most innovative and talented people in our industry. This approach is a key driver of our progress.\nWe recognize that some people come to Accenture having faced obstacles as an aspect of their identity or lived experience. At Accenture, we are committed to harness these perspectives and ensure that all of our people have the opportunity to thrive and unlock their full potential. We are a meritocracy. Our intention is to foster a culture and a workplace in which all of our people feel a sense of belonging and are respected and empowered to do their best work and to create 360\u00b0 value for all our stakeholders.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 1.

Business 11\nEnvironmental Sustainability\nWe help our clients together with our ecosystem partners, to define, measure and achieve their environmental, social and governance goals by connecting sustainability with their transformation agendas across their strategy and operations to make their value chains more sustainable.\nWe have a strong commitment to environmental sustainability in how we operate our business, and we hold ourselves accountable to clear and measurable objectives. Our environment goals span three areas: reducing our carbon emissions including through nature-based carbon removal programs, moving toward zero waste and planning for water risk.\nReducing our Carbon Emissions\nThe most significant aspects of our environmental footprint are the greenhouse gas emissions related to electricity used in our locations, as well as business travel and purchased goods and services.\nIn 2020, we signed the UN Global Compact Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C Pledge, joining leading companies in pledging to do our part to keep global warming below 1.5\u00b0 Celsius, in alignment with the Paris Agreement and the criteria and recommendations of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\nWe are continuing to work toward our goal of net-zero emissions by 2025 by first focusing on reductions across our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and then removing any remaining emissions through nature-based carbon removal projects.\nWe are also establishing new goals to align with the SBTis criteria, guidance and recommendations for setting science-based net-zero targets. In 2023, we set a new, near-term target aligned to 2030, which was approved by the SBTi.\nCarbon Reduction\nOur approach to carbon reduction in support of our goals includes:\nRenewable electricity. In 2023, we achieved our goal of 100% renewable electricity in our offices. As we do not own our office buildings and procure most of our energy from the grid, we increase our renewable electricity by purchasing renewable electricity contracts equivalent to the amount of electricity we consume. Going forward, we plan to maintain 100% renewable electricity on an annual basis through continued purchase of renewable electricity contracts. As we purchase renewable electricity, we also support the generation of more renewable sources of electricity.\nAchieved\n100%\nrenewable electricity\nby the end of 2023\nEnabling low carbon business travel. We continue to use technology to facilitate more cost and carbon-efficient delivery for our clients and our business and have implemented an internal carbon price on travel to encourage climate smart travel decisions. In addition, we have developed analytics and reporting focused on our business travel emissions so that we can share emissions data with our clients as part of our delivery activities.\nEngaging our suppliers. We are working with our suppliers to reduce our Scope 3 emissions. Our goal is that 90% of our key suppliers disclose their environmental targets and the actions being taken to reduce emissions by the end of 2025. Our suppliers are making good progress, with 68% of key suppliers disclosing their targets and 75% disclosing the actions they are taking as of December 2022. Key suppliers are defined as vendors that represent a significant portion of our 2019 Scope 3 emissions.\nCarbon Removal\nNature-based carbon removal. To offset our remaining emissions, we are investing in nature-based carbon removal solutions to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Our nature-based carbon removal projects will also support and respect the universal principles of the UNGC in the relevant areas of human rights, labor, environment, anticorruption and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 1. Business 12\nMoving Toward Zero Waste\nAddressing e-waste and office furniture. We have a goal of reusing or recycling 100% of our e-waste, such as computers and servers, as well as all our office furniture, by the end of 2025. During fiscal 2023, we reused or recycled nearly 100% of our e-waste relating to computers, servers and uninterruptible power supply devices. We continue to refine our processes, leverage our asset tracking system and work with vendors to help us extend the life cycle of our furniture, including through refurbishment and reuse or recycling.\nEliminate single-use plastics in our office locations. During fiscal 2023, we eliminated single-use plastics in our office locations by purchasing reusable and plastic-free items.\nPlanning for Water Risk\nMitigating the potential impacts of climate change-related water risk. Although Accenture is not a water-intensive company, to safeguard our people and operations we are developing water resiliency action plans to reduce the impact of climate-related flooding, drought and water scarcity on our business and our people in high-risk areas.\nGlobal Delivery Capability\nA key differentiator is our global delivery capability.

Accenture Leadership is comprised of members of our global management committee (our primary management and leadership team, which consists of approximately 50 of our most senior leaders), senior managing directors and managing directors.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K Item 1A. Risk Factors 16\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies, including us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price. Risks in this section are grouped in the following categories: (1) Business Risks; (2) Financial Risks; (3) Operational Risks; and (4) Legal and Regulatory Risks. Many risks affect more than one category, and the risks are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories.\nBusiness Risks\nOur results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients businesses and levels of business activity.\nGlobal macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions affect us, our clients businesses and the markets they serve. Volatile, negative and uncertain economic and political conditions have in the past undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets and other markets, which are increasingly interdependent, causing our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies, and resulting in clients reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us, which negatively affects our business. Growth in some of the markets we serve has slowed and could continue to slow, or could slow in other markets or stagnate or contract, in each case, for an extended period of time. Because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets, an economic slowdown in any of those markets could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOngoing economic and political volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting. Economic and political volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations. Changing demand patterns from economic and political volatility and uncertainty, including as a result of increasing geopolitical tensions, inflation, economic downturns, changes in global trade policies, global health emergencies and their impact on us, our clients and the industries we serve, have in the past had a negative impact and could in the future have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur business depends on generating and maintaining client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.\nOur financial results depend in part on the demand for our services and solutions, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product. As described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic and political conditions and lower growth or contraction in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients. Examples of areas of significant change include digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings, which are continually evolving, as well as developments in areas such as AI, including generative AI, augmented and virtual reality, automation, blockchain, Internet of Things, quantum and edge computing, infrastructure and network engineering, intelligent connected products, digital engineering and manufacturing, and robotics solutions. As we expand our services and solutions into these new areas, we may be exposed to operational, legal, regulatory, ethical, technological and other risks specific to such new areas, which may negatively affect our reputation and demand for our services and solutions.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors 17\nTechnological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of cloud, data and AI solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue. Some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and will continue to do so in the future. This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies. Such technological developments and spending delays can negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial models that reflect the value of these technological developments or if the pace and level of spending on new technologies are not sufficient to make up any shortfall.\nDevelopments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions. If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected. For example, if we fail to continue to develop leading AI services and solutions, including generative AI, we may lose our leadership position in this area. We are applying AI to our services, to how we deliver work to our clients, and to our own internal operations. AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition, including from our own clients, who may develop their own internal AI-related capabilities, which in each case, can lead to reduced demand for our services or solutions. As these technologies evolve, some services and tasks currently performed by our people will be replaced by automation. In addition, there are significant risks and uncertainties involved in developing and deploying AI, which may expose us to legal, reputational and financial harm.\nIn a particular geographic market, service or industry group, a small number of clients have contributed, or may, in the future contribute, a significant portion of the revenues of such geographic market, service or industry group, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant geographic market, service or industry group. For example, we are experiencing reduced demand particularly in our Communications, Media & Technology industry group.\nMany of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days notice. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our managed services contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract. Many of our contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide. Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a clients strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.\nIf we are unable to match people and their skills with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our people with market-leading skills and capabilities in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain people with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally. We must hire or reskill, retain and inspire appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in demand, technology, industry and the macroeconomic environment, and continuously innovate to grow our business. For example, if we are unable to hire or retrain our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuous changes in technology and the industries we serve, we may not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand. There is competition for scarce talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies, and our people have been directly targeted because of their highly sought-after skills and this will likely continue.\nThere is a risk that at certain points in time, we may have more people than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets. In these situations, we have engaged, and may in the future engage, in actions to rebalance our workforce, including reducing the rate of new hires and increasing involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of people and skills in balance with client demand, such as the business optimization actions initiated in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. In some countries we are required by local law to consult with employee representative bodies such as works councils, which may constrain our operational flexibility and efficiency in balancing our workforce with client demand and make us less competitive. In addition, while an immaterial percentage of our global\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors 18\nworkforce is currently unionized, the unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational impediments.\nAt certain times and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand. In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing people or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs. If we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf our utilization rate is too high or too low, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects.\nWe are particularly dependent on retaining members of Accenture Leadership with critical capabilities. If we are unable to do so, our ability to innovate, generate new business opportunities and effectively lead large and complex transformations and client relationships could be jeopardized. We depend on identifying, developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead our businesses. This includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in markets where the depth of skilled employees may be limited. Our ability to expand in our key markets depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, develop, retain and integrate both leaders for the local business and people with critical capabilities.\nOur equity-based incentive compensation plans and other variable cash compensation programs, as well as promotions, are designed to reward high-performing individuals for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us. If the anticipated value of such incentives or the pace of promotions does not materialize because of company performance or volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract and retain the people we need could be adversely affected. In addition, if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract and retain people could be negatively affected.\nWe face legal, reputational and financial risks from any failure to protect client and/or Accenture data from security incidents or cyberattacks.\nWe are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our people, clients, ecosystem partners and vendors. As the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow, including as a result of the increasing reliance on, and use of, mobile technologies, social media and cloud-based services, as more of our employees continue to work remotely, and as cyberattacks become increasingly sophisticated (e.g. deepfakes and AI generated social engineering), the risk of security incidents and cyberattacks has increased. Such incidents could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of or damage to our systems and those of our clients, ecosystem partners and vendors, and unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, including personal data and proprietary business information. In the past, we have experienced, and in the future, we may again experience, data security incidents resulting from unauthorized access to our and our service providers systems and unauthorized acquisition of our data and our clients data including: inadvertent disclosure, misconfiguration of systems, phishing ransomware or malware attacks. In addition, our clients have experienced, and may in the future experience, breaches of systems and cloud-based services enabled, managed or provided by us. To date these incidents have not had a material impact on our or our clients operations; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future, and such incidents have in the past and may in the future have the impacts discussed below.\nIn providing services and solutions to clients, we often manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client, Accenture or other third-party data, including personal data and proprietary information, and we expect these activities to increase, including through the use of AI, the Internet of Things and analytics. Unauthorized disclosure or use of, denial of access to, or other incidents involving sensitive or confidential client, vendor, ecosystem partner or Accenture data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud, misappropriation, or cybersecurity, ransomware or malware attacks, or other intentional or unintentional acts, could damage our reputation and our competitive positioning in the marketplace, disrupt our or our clients business, cause us to lose clients and result in significant financial exposure and legal liability. Similarly, unauthorized access to or through, denial of access to, or other incidents involving, our software and IT supply chain or software-as-a-service providers, our or our service providers information systems or those we develop for our clients, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyberattack by computer programmers, hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who continuously develop and deploy viruses, ransomware, malware or other malicious software programs or social engineering attacks, has and could in the future result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability, damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations - see risk factor below entitled Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. Cybersecurity threats are constantly expanding and evolving, becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them and maintaining effective security measures and protocols.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors 19\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, including privacy and cybersecurity laws such as the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the United Kingdoms GDPR, U.S. states recent comprehensive privacy legislation, as well as various other U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of privacy, health or other personally identifiable information and data privacy and cybersecurity laws in other regions. These laws and regulations continue to evolve, are increasing in complexity and number and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate, which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us. Various privacy laws impose compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data, including localization of data and the cross-border transfer of data, and significant financial penalties for noncompliance. For example, failure to comply with the GDPR may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue, orders to discontinue certain data processing operations, civil lawsuits, or reputational damage. If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client, third-party or Accenture data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. These monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant. In addition, our liability insurance, which includes cyber insurance, might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security incidents, cyberattacks and other related incidents.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively.\nThe markets in which we offer our services and solutions are highly competitive. Our competitors include:\nlarge multinational IT service providers, including the services arms of large global technology providers;\noff-shore IT service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in India;\naccounting firms and consultancies that provide consulting and other IT services and solutions;\nsolution or service providers that compete with us in a specific geographic market, industry or service area, including advertising agency holding companies, engineering services providers and technology start-ups and other companies that can scale rapidly to focus on or disrupt certain markets and provide new or alternative products, services or delivery models; and\nin-house IT departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm.\nSome competitors may have greater financial, marketing or other resources than we do and, therefore, may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals, may be able to innovate and provide new services and solutions faster than we can or may be able to anticipate the need for services and solutions before we do. Our competitors may also team together to create competing offerings.\nEven if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs, competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer, including to companies that are our clients. Some competitors are more established in certain markets, and may make executing our growth strategy to expand in these markets more challenging. Additionally, competitors may also offer more aggressive pricing or contractual terms, which may affect our ability to win work. Our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully and expand in the markets we currently serve. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers, acquisitions or teaming arrangements. Consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours. New services or technologies offered by competitors, ecosystem partners or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives, which may adversely affect our results of operations. The technology companies described above, including many of our ecosystem partners, are increasingly able to offer services related to their software, platform, cloud migration and other solutions, or are developing software, platform, cloud migration and other solutions that require integration services to a lesser extent or replace them in their entirety. These more integrated services and solutions may represent more attractive alternatives to clients than some of our services and solutions, which may materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.\nWe believe the Accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services and solutions from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. However, our corporate reputation is susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients or competitors, cybersecurity incidents or service outages, internal control deficiencies, delivery or solution failures, compliance violations,\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors 20\ngovernment investigations or legal proceedings. We may also experience reputational damage from employees, advocacy groups, regulators, investors and other stakeholders that disagree with the services and solutions that we offer, the clients or markets that we serve, or the ways in which we operate our business. Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, ecosystem partners, joint venture partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, legislators or government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media, including social media influencers and advocacy groups.\nThere is a risk that negative or inaccurate information about Accenture, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements or could negatively impact our relationships with ecosystem partners, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the Accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.\nOur brand and reputation are also associated with our public commitments to various corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives, including our goals relating to sustainability and inclusion and diversity. Our disclosures on these matters and any failure or perceived failure to achieve or accurately report on our commitments, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our client relationships or our recruitment and retention efforts, as well as expose us to potential legal liability. In addition, positions we take or do not take on social issues may be unpopular with some of our employees, our clients or potential clients, legislators or government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media, or advocacy groups, which may impact our ability to attract or retain employees or the demand for our services. We also may choose not to conduct business with potential clients or discontinue or not expand business with existing clients due to these positions.\nIf we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key ecosystem partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own. A very significant portion of our revenue and services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major ecosystem partners. See Business-Services.\nThe business that we conduct through these alliances could decrease or fail to grow for a variety of reasons. The priorities and objectives of our ecosystem partners may differ from ours. They offer services and solutions that compete with some of our services and solutions. They may also form closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors.\nSome of our ecosystem partners are also large clients or suppliers of technology to us. The decisions we make vis-\u00e0-vis an ecosystem partner may impact our ongoing alliance relationships with other members of our ecosystem.\nOur ecosystem partners may at times be impacted by global events, the changing macroeconomic environment and supply chain disruptions, as well as rapid increases in demand for their products and services, any of which may impact their ability to provide their products and services within our expected timeframes or at anticipated prices. In addition, our ecosystem partners may also experience reduced demand for their technology or software, including, for example, in response to changes in technology, which could lessen related demand for our services and solutions.\nWe must anticipate and respond to continuous changes in technology and develop alliance relationships with new providers of relevant technology and services. We must secure meaningful alliances with these providers early in their life cycle so that we can develop the right number of certified people with skills in new technologies. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with current partners and identify new and emerging providers of relevant technology to expand our network of ecosystem partners, we may not be able to differentiate our services or compete effectively in the market.\nIf we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason, we may be less competitive, our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFinancial Risks\nOur profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies or fail to satisfy certain agreed-upon targets or specific service levels.\nOur profitability is highly dependent on a variety of factors and could be materially impacted by any of the following:\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors 21\nOur results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to meet our profitability expectations. If we are not able to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, our revenues and profitability could materially suffer. The rates we are able to charge for our services and solutions are affected by a number of factors, including:\ngeneral economic and political conditions;\nour clients desire to reduce their costs;\nthe competitive environment in our industry;\nour ability to accurately estimate our service delivery costs, upon which our pricing is sometimes determined, including our ability to estimate the impact of inflation and foreign exchange on our service delivery costs over long-term contracts; and\nthe procurement practices of clients and their use of third-party advisors.\nOur profitability could suffer if we are not able to remain competitive. The competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to secure new contracts at our target economics in a number of ways, any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations. The less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions and/or clearly convey the value of our services and solutions, the more risk we have in winning new work in sufficient volumes and at our target pricing and overall economics. In addition, the introduction of new technologies (such as generative AI), services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing and impact our overall economics for the services or solutions we offer. Competitors may be willing, at times, to take on more risk or price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share.\nOur profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability. Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs, including taking actions to reduce certain costs. Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and the workforce needed to deliver them. If we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to cost-effectively hire and retain people with the knowledge and skills necessary to deliver our services and solutions, particularly in areas of new technologies and offerings and in the right geographic locations, we may incur increased costs, which could reduce our ability to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth and our desired levels of profitability. The timing and amount of costs related to our business optimization actions initiated in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and the nature and extent of benefits realized from such actions are subject to uncertainties and other factors, including local country consultation processes and regulations, and may differ from our current expectations and estimates.\nIf we do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable. Our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions, which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing engagements to a clients satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.\nMoreover, many of our contracts include clauses that tie our ultimate compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones. If we fail to satisfy these measures, it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms, any of which could significantly affect our profitability. We also have a number of contracts in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule. These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate and could negatively impact our profit margins if not achieved. Similarly, if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties or our clients to meet their commitments, or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.\nWe are increasingly entering into contracts for large, complex client engagements to transform our clients businesses. These deals may involve transforming a clients business, transitioning it to the cloud and updating their technology, while operating portions of their business, all in a compressed timeframe. The scale and complexity of these compressed transformational projects present risks in execution. In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances. Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner, at the\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors 22\nanticipated cost, and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale engagements or enterprises. Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted. In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control. Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations.\nChanges in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. We calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are subject to ongoing audits, investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, and are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits, investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, investigations and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by challenges to our intercompany transactions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates and changes in accounting principles, including the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Tax rates and policies in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change materially as a result of shifting economic, social and political conditions. In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position. A number of countries where we do business, including the United States and many countries in the European Union, have implemented, and are considering implementing, changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations. There remains significant uncertainty around whether these changes will ultimately be implemented and, if implemented, the extent of their impact.\nThe overall tax environment remains highly uncertain and increasingly complex. The European Commission has been conducting investigations, focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules. In the U.S., various proposals to raise corporate income taxes are periodically considered. Individual countries across the globe and the European Union have either enacted or plan to enact digital taxes to impose incremental taxes on companies based on where ultimate users are located. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a global coalition of member countries, further developed a two-pillar plan to reform international taxation. The plan aims to prevent the proliferation of separate new digital taxes and to ensure a fairer distribution of profits among countries by creating a new global system to tax income based on the location of users, and to impose a floor on tax competition through the introduction of a global minimum tax. European Union member states have agreed to implement the OECDs global corporate minimum tax rate of 15%. Other countries are also actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECDs two-pillar framework. The increased focus of the European Commission and various jurisdictions on investigations and enacting new tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAlthough we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the United States and Ireland, legislative or diplomatic action could be taken, or the treaty may be amended in such a way, that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty. Our inability to rely on the treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense. In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by changes in the laws (or in their interpretation or enforcement) around the definition of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes and by changes in tax law or policy (or in their interpretation or enforcement) in Ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with Ireland or the United States.\nOur results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nAlthough we report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, a majority of our revenues is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had an adverse effect, and could in the future have a material adverse effect, on our results of operations.\nBecause our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect our revenues, operating income\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors 23\nand the value of balance-sheet items, including intercompany payables and receivables, originally denominated in other currencies. These changes cause our growth stated in U.S. dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods. Our currency hedging programs, which are designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items, might not be successful. Additionally, some transactions and balances may be denominated in currencies for which there is no available market to hedge.\nAs we continue to leverage our global delivery model, more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services. An increase in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee or Philippine peso, against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could increase costs for delivery of services at off-shore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency. Our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact, and our currency hedging activities, which are designed to partially offset this impact, might not be successful. This could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources. In addition, our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk. These include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts, risks related to ineffective hedges and risks related to currency fluctuations. We also face risks that extreme economic conditions, political instability, or hostilities or disasters of the type described below could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposures that we are hedging. Such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedged exposure.\nChanges to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. It is possible that changes in accounting standards could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. The application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition, and our accompanying disclosure with respect to, among other things, revenue recognition and income taxes. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience, contractual commitments and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If our estimates, or the assumptions underlying such estimates, are not correct, actual results may differ materially from our estimates, and we may need to, among other things, adjust revenues or accrue additional costs that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nAs a result of our geographically diverse operations and our strategy to continue to grow in our key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks.\nWe have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 49 countries around the world. One aspect of our strategy is to continue to grow in our key markets around the world. Our strategy might not be successful. If we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and strategy, our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected.\nHealth emergencies or pandemics, including COVID-19; acts of terrorist violence; political, social and civil unrest; regional and international war and other hostilities and international responses to these wars and hostilities; natural disasters, volcanic eruptions, sea level rise, floods, droughts and water scarcity, heat waves, wildfires and storms, occurrences of which may increase in frequency and severity as a result of climate change; or the threat of or perceived potential for these events; and other acts of god have had and could in the future have significantly negative impacts on us. These events could adversely affect our clients levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles. These events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world, whether the facilities are ours or those of our ecosystem partners, suppliers or clients. By disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified people, these types of events impact our ability to deliver our services and solutions to our clients. Extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network or cloud services at our facilities or in the areas where our people are working remotely, as well as physical infrastructure damage to, system failures at, cyberattacks on, or security incidents involving, our facilities or systems, or those of our ecosystem partners, suppliers or clients, could also adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and serve our clients. If any of these circumstances occurs, we have a greater risk that interruptions in communications with our clients and other Accenture locations and people, and any down-time in important processes we operate for clients, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors 24\nOur business model is dependent on our global delivery capability. While our delivery centers are located throughout the world, we have based large portions of our delivery capability in India and the Philippines, where we have the largest and second largest number of our people located, respectively. In addition, certain of our clients and markets are primarily supported by individual delivery centers. Concentrating our delivery capability in these locations presents a number of operational risks, including those discussed in this risk factor, many of which are beyond our control and which have been and may in the future be exacerbated by increasing geopolitical tensions. While these events have not materially impacted our ability to deliver services to our clients, international conflicts are unpredictable and we might not be as successful in mitigating these operational risks in the future.\nWe are unable to protect our people, facilities and systems, and those of our ecosystem partners, suppliers and clients, against all such events. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic events occur where large numbers of our people are located, or simultaneously affect our people in multiple locations around the world. We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, conflicts and wars. If these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients, our results of operations could be significantly adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.\nAs of August 31, 2023, we had approximately 733,000 employees worldwide. Our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges. As our organization grows and evolves, it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge or to effectively change the strategy, operations or culture of our Company in a timely manner. It might also become more difficult to maintain our culture, effectively manage and monitor our people and operations, effectively communicate our core values, policies and procedures, strategies and goals, and motivate, engage and retain our people, particularly given our world-wide operations, rate of new hires, and the significant percentage of our employees who have the option to work remotely. The size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks, despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances. For example, employee misconduct could involve the improper use of sensitive or confidential information entrusted to us, or obtained inappropriately, or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information, including personal data and proprietary information. Furthermore, the inappropriate use of social networking sites and unapproved technologies, such as public-facing, free generative AI tools, by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality, unauthorized disclosure of non-public company information or damage to our reputation. If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired. In addition, from time to time, we have made, and may continue to make, changes to our operating model, including how we are organized, as the needs and size of our business change, and if we do not successfully implement the changes, our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted.\nWe might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses.\nWe expect to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures to enhance or add to our skills and capabilities or offerings of services and solutions, or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets. We have increased and may again in the future increase the amount of capital invested in such opportunities. These acquisitions and other transactions and investments involve challenges and risks, such as that we may not succeed in completing targeted transactions, including as a result of the market becoming increasingly competitive, or achieve desired results of operations.\nFurthermore, we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire, and these risks may be magnified by the size and number of transactions we have executed. Ongoing business may be disrupted, and our managements attention may be diverted by acquisition, investment, transition or integration activities. In addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations. The loss of key executives, employees, customers, suppliers, vendors and other business partners of businesses we acquire may adversely impact the value of the assets, operations or businesses. Furthermore, acquisitions or joint ventures may result in significant costs and expenses, including those related to retention payments, equity compensation, severance pay, early retirement costs, intangible asset amortization and asset impairment charges, enhancing controls, procedures and policies including those related to financial reporting, disclosure, and cyber and information security, assumed litigation and other liabilities, and legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, which could negatively affect our profitability as these costs and expenses grow along with the increased capital invested in such acquisitions and joint ventures. We may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors 25\nWe might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition, investment or joint venture we undertake. We might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money. We may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest, including from that companys known and unknown obligations, intellectual property or other assets, terminated employees, current or former clients or other third parties. In addition, we may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring, investing in or partnering with a company, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition targets previous activities, or from an acquisitions controls related to financial reporting, disclosure, and cyber and information security environment. The number of transactions we execute annually may increase this risk. If any of these circumstances occurs, they could result in unexpected regulatory or legal exposure, including litigation with new or existing clients, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our relationships with clients and our business. In addition, we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which we have made minority investments or in which we have acquired less than 100% of the equity. This lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational, financial, legal, compliance or operational risks. Litigation, indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses. For example, we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement, such as earnout payments or closing working capital adjustments. Alternatively, shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions. If we are unable to complete the number and kind of investments for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services.\nWe also periodically evaluate, and have engaged in, the disposition of assets and businesses. Divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and people, the diversion of managements attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees. After reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, including obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in or liability with respect to the divested assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations. Any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our results of operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nOur business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability.\nWe are subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees, clients, ecosystem partners, subcontractors, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, whistleblower claims, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. Regardless of the merits of the claims, the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant, and such matters can be time-consuming and divert managements attention and resources. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, fines, penalties, debarment or injunctive relief against us. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nWe could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, contribute to internal control or other deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties, including clients, ecosystem partners, employees and former employees, and other parties with whom we conduct business, or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients, or if our services or solutions cause bodily injuries or property damage. For example, by taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients businesses, including functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients, by contributing to the design, development, manufacturing and/or engineering of client products, or by providing various operational technology, digital manufacturing and robotics or other industrial automation equipment solutions, and advisory and management services for infrastructure projects, we may be exposed to additional and evolving operational, regulatory, reputational or other risks specific to these areas, including risks related to data security, product liability, health and safety, hazardous materials and other environmental risks. A failure of a clients system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations. In order to remain competitive, we increasingly enter into agreements based on our clients contract terms after conducting an assessment of the risk of doing so, which may expose us to additional risk. In addition, the contracting practices of competitors, along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients, may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the industry. We may commit to providing services or solutions that we are\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors 26\nunable to deliver or whose delivery may reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss. If we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements, liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections, we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, as we expand our services and solutions into new areas, we may be exposed to additional and evolving risks specific to these new areas.\nIn addition, we engage in platform trust and safety services on behalf of clients, including content moderation, which could have a negative impact on our employees due to the nature of the materials they review. We have been subject to media coverage regarding our provision of these services as well as litigation related to the provision of these services, which may result in adverse judgments or settlements or government inquiries and investigations. Moreover, the use of AI may give rise to risks related to harmful content, accuracy, bias, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, and cybersecurity, among others, and also bring the possibility of new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation or other legal liability, or ethical concerns that could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nWhile we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if they prevail, the amount of our recovery.\nOur global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous, changing, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, including ESG regulation and reporting requirements, anti-competition, anti-money-laundering, data privacy and protection, government compliance, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, product liability, health and safety, environmental, human rights and AI regulations. The sanctions environment has resulted in new sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our clients, ecosystem partners, and us. For example, as a result of the sanctions imposed in response to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, we were restricted from offering certain of our services to clients in some locations. The global nature of our operations, including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us, and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries, further increase the difficulty of compliance. Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, enforcement actions or criminal sanctions against us and/or our employees, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines, enforcement actions and/or criminal prosecution or sanctions, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage and restrictions on our ability to effectively carry out our contractual obligations and thereby expose us to potential claims from our clients. Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights.\nIn particular, in many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate and/or seek to expand, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws, or regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. Our employees, subcontractors, vendors, agents, alliance or joint venture partners, the companies we acquire and their employees, subcontractors, vendors and agents, and other third parties with which we associate, could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations. Violations of these laws or regulations by us, our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions (whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations), including fines or penalties, disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work, including U.S. federal contracting, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations and our reputation.\nChanges in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions. For example, changes in laws and regulations to limit using off-shore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use off-shore resources, which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions, could adversely affect our results of operations. Such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred onshore, resulting in greater costs to us, and could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients.\nIncreasing focus on ESG matters has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, the adoption of legal and regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, as well as legal and\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors 27\nregulatory requirements requiring climate, human rights and supply chain-related disclosures. If new laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements, we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet such obligations. In addition, our selection of voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards, and the interpretation or application of those frameworks and standards, may change from time to time or may not meet the expectations of investors or other stakeholders. Our ability to achieve our ESG commitments is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include: (1) the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources and technologies; (2) evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures; (3) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability, diversity and other standards; and (4) our ability to recruit, develop, and retain diverse talent. In addition, standards for tracking and reporting on ESG matters, including climate change and human rights related matters, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Methodologies for reporting ESG data may be updated and previously reported ESG data may be adjusted to reflect improvement in availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations and other changes in circumstances. Our processes and controls for reporting ESG matters across our operations are evolving along with multiple disparate standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting ESG metrics, including ESG-related disclosures that may be required by the SEC, European and other regulators, and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to achieve such goals in the future.\nIn addition, several jurisdictions where we operate have proposed legislation regulating AI and non-personal data that may impose significant requirements on how we design, build and deploy AI and handle non-personal data for ourselves and our clients.\nOur work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.\nOur clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities. Our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nGovernment entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices and compliance with government contract requirements. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, routinely audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs, for compliance with the Cost Accounting Standards and the Federal Acquisition Regulation. These agencies also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding our accounting, information technology and other systems in connection with our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts. Negative findings from existing and future audits, investigations or inquiries, or failure to comply with applicable IT security or supply chain requirements, could affect our future sales and profitability by preventing us, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time, or result in other adverse consequences described in the following paragraphs. In addition, if the U.S. government concludes that certain costs are not reimbursable, have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work, then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs, may have to refund money that has already been paid to us or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rates for our work. Negative findings from existing and future audits of our business systems, including our accounting system, may result in the U.S. government preventing us from billing, at least temporarily, a percentage of our costs. As a result of prior negative findings in connection with audits, investigations and inquiries, we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequences described above and may in the future experience further adverse consequences, which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations.\nIf a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, or alleges that such conduct occurred, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act, and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities.\nU.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and heightened disclosure obligations. From time to time we have made required or voluntary disclosures to the government in connection with our government contracting work. Disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of credible evidence of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or improper gratuity, a violation of the civil U.S. False Claims Act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government. Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the U.S. federal level. Reported matters may also lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including those described above.\nGovernment contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients. For example, government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity. Negative publicity, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors 28\nTerms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate. For example, these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties.\nGovernment entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience. Changes in government or political developments, including government closures or shutdowns, budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions or other debt constraints could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. Furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments.\nPolitical and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed.\nOur ability to work for the U.S. government is impacted by the fact that we are an Irish company. We elected to enter into a proxy agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense that enhances the ability of our U.S. federal government contracting subsidiary to perform certain work for the U.S. government. The proxy agreement regulates the management and operation of, and limits the control we can exercise over, this subsidiary. In addition, legislative and executive proposals remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future, which, if enacted, could place additional limitations on or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the United States or could include requirements that would otherwise affect our results of operations. Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced and/or enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain U.S. companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the United States. While Accenture was not a U.S. company that reincorporated outside the United States, it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way that negatively affects Accenture.\nThe occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our proprietary platforms, methodologies, processes, software, hardware and other solutions. Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited intellectual property protection of our services or solutions, and the protection in some countries may be very limited. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies and procedures, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. These laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to obtain or maintain intellectual property protection. There is uncertainty concerning the scope of patent and other intellectual property protection for software and business methods, which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights. Even where we obtain intellectual property protection, our intellectual property rights may not prevent or deter competitors, former employees, or other third parties from reverse engineering our solutions or proprietary methodologies and processes or independently developing services or solutions similar to or duplicative of ours. Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight, and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights.\nIn addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions, including, for example, our software and hardware solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties (including competitors as well as non-practicing holders of intellectual property assets), and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Furthermore, although we have established policies and procedures to respect the intellectual property rights of third parties and that prohibit the unauthorized use of intellectual property, we may not be aware if our employees have misappropriated and/or misused intellectual property, and their actions could result in claims of intellectual property misappropriation and/or infringement from third parties. These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future. Any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time. In most of our\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors 29\ncontracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties. In some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client. Any claims or litigation in this area could be time-consuming and costly, damage our reputation and/or require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients. If we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms, or we are unable to implement in a cost-effective manner alternative technology, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software and hardware solutions and continue to develop and license our software and sell our hardware to multiple clients. Any infringement action brought against us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us.\nFurther, we rely on third-party software, hardware and other intellectual property in providing some of our services and solutions. If we lose our ability to continue using any such software, hardware or intellectual property for any reason, including because it is found to infringe the rights of others, we will need to obtain substitutes or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions. Our inability to replace such software, hardware or intellectual property effectively or in a timely and cost-effective manner could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are incorporated in Ireland and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to our shareholders. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.\nIrish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. The United States currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. As such, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on U.S. federal or state civil liability laws, including the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws, or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws.\nAs an Irish company, we are governed by the Companies Act. The Companies Act differs in some significant, and possibly material, respects from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors.\nUnder Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under Irish law, and may only do so in limited circumstances. Directors of an Irish company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act with due care and skill, honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company. Directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries. If a director or officer of an Irish company is found to have breached his or her duties to that company, he or she could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty.\nUnder Irish law, we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares, including shares that are part of the companys authorized but unissued share capital. In addition, unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders, when an Irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders, it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis. If we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders, or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations, our ability to issue shares under our equity compensation plans and, if applicable, to facilitate funding acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected.\nSome companies that conduct substantial business in the United States but that have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding U.S. taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over U.S. companies. Accenture never conducted business under a U.S. parent company and pays U.S. taxes on all of its U.S. operations. Nonetheless, we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in Ireland.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 30\nItem 1B.

The New York Stock Exchange is the principal United States market for these shares. As of September 28, 2023, there were 369 holders of record of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares.\nThere is no trading market for Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares. As of September 28, 2023, there were 14 holders of record of Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares.\nDividends\nFor information about our dividend activity during fiscal 2023, see Note 14 (Shareholders Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOn September 27, 2023, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share on our Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 12, 2023, payable on November 15, 2023. For the remainder of fiscal 2024, we expect to declare additional quarterly dividends in December 2023 and March and June 2024, to be paid in February, May and August 2024, respectively, subject to the approval of the Board of Directors.\nIn certain circumstances, as an Irish tax resident company, we may be required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax (DWT) (currently at the rate of 25%) from dividends paid to our shareholders. Shareholders resident in relevant territories (including countries that are European Union member states (other than Ireland), the United States and other countries with which Ireland has a tax treaty) may be exempted from Irish DWT. However, shareholders residing in other countries will generally be subject to Irish DWT.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nNone.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 5.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we purchased 3,149,838 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under this program for an aggregate price of $984 million. The open-market purchase program does not have an expiration date.\n(3)As of August 31, 2023, our aggregate available authorization for share purchases and redemptions was $2,490 million, which management has the discretion to use for either our publicly announced open-market share purchase program or our other share purchase programs. Since August 2001 and as of August 31, 2023, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized an aggregate of $46.1 billion for share purchases and redemptions by Accenture plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. On September 27, 2023, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc approved $4,000 million in additional share repurchase authority, bringing Accentures total outstanding authority to $6,490 million.\n(4)During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, Accenture purchased 53,469 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in transactions unrelated to publicly announced share plans or programs. These transactions consisted of acquisitions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under our various employee equity share plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and our other share purchase programs. Item 6. [Reserved]\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 33\nItem 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe use the terms Accenture, we, our and us in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to fiscal 2023 means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2023. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.\nWe use the term in local currency so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results in local currency are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior-year periods foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\nOverview\nAccenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions across Strategy & Consulting, Technology, Operations, Industry X and Song. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North America, Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). We combine our strength in technology and leadership in cloud, data and AI with unmatched industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to help the worlds leading businesses, governments and other organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance citizen services-creating tangible value at speed and scale.\nOur results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary environment and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which has impacted and may continue to impact our business. These conditions have slowed the pace and level of client spending for smaller contracts with a shorter duration, especially for our consulting services. From an industry perspective, we are also experiencing reduced demand particularly in our Communications, Media & Technology industry group.\nKey Metrics\nKey metrics for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 are included below. We have presented operating margin and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis to exclude the impact of $1,063 million in business optimization costs and, with respect to diluted earnings per share, the impact of a $253 million investment gain recorded during fiscal 2023. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nRevenues of $64.1 billion, representing 4% growth in U.S. dollars and 8% growth in local currency;\nNew bookings of $72.2 billion, an increase of 1% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency;\nOperating margin of 13.7%, compared to 15.2% in fiscal 2022; adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 15.4%;\nDiluted earnings per share of $10.77, compared to $10.71 for fiscal 2022; adjusted earnings per share increased 9% to $11.67; and\nCash returned to shareholders of $7.2 billion, including share purchases of $4.3 billion and dividends of $2.8 billion.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 7.

During fiscal 2023, revenue growth in local currency was very strong in Growth Markets and Europe and solid in North America. We experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in Resources and Health & Public Service, strong in Products and Financial Services, partially offset by a modest decline in Communications, Media & Technology. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in managed services and modest in consulting during fiscal 2023. The business environment is competitive, and we are experiencing lower pricing across the business. We define pricing as contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell.\nIn our consulting business, revenues for fiscal 2023 decreased 1% in U.S. dollars and increased 3% in local currency compared to fiscal 2022. Consulting revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2023 was driven by strong growth in Growth Markets and solid growth in Europe, while North America was flat. Our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their digital transformation, including moving to the cloud, embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences. While we continue to experience demand for these services, we are seeing a slower pace and level of client spending, especially for smaller contracts with a shorter duration.\nIn our managed services business, revenues for fiscal 2023 increased 11% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currency compared to fiscal 2022. Managed services revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2023 was driven by very strong growth in Growth Markets and Europe and strong growth in North America. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and cybersecurity-as-a-service (formerly managed security services). In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and operational cost savings.\nAs we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. While a significant portion of our revenues are in U.S. dollars, the majority of our revenues are denominated in other currencies, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could in the future have a material effect on our financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during fiscal 2023, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 4% lower than our revenue growth in local currency for the year. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges, we estimate that our fiscal 2024 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately equal to our revenue growth in local currency.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 35\nPeople Metrics\nUtilization\nWorkforce\nAnnualized Voluntary Attrition\n91%\n733,000\n13%\nconsistent with fiscal 2022\ncompared to approximately 721,000 as of August 31, 2022\ncompared to 19% in fiscal 2022\nUtilization for fiscal 2023 was 91%, consistent with fiscal 2022. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our workforce, the majority of which serves our clients, increased to approximately 733,000 as of August 31, 2023, compared to approximately 721,000 as of August 31, 2022. The year-over-year increase in our workforce reflects people added in connection with acquisitions and hiring for specific skills.\nFor fiscal 2023, attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 13%, down from 19% in fiscal 2022. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 14%, up from 13% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we initiated actions to streamline operations and transform our nonbillable corporate functions to reduce costs.\nIn addition, we adjust compensation in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our people, compensation increases became effective December 1st of fiscal 2023. Given the overall inflationary environment, compensation has increased faster than in prior years, but is moderating. We strive to adjust pricing as well as drive cost and delivery efficiencies, such as changing the mix of people and utilizing technology, to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin and contract profitability.\nOur ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: match people and skills with the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover or offset increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate new employees.\nOperating Expenses\nThe primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other payroll costs, and non-payroll costs such as facilities, technology and travel. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for people that are non-client-facing, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.\nGross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for fiscal 2023 was 32.3%, compared with 32.0% for fiscal 2022. The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2023 was primarily due to lower labor costs, including lower subcontractor costs, partially offset by higher non-payroll costs, primarily for travel.\nSales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.9% for fiscal 2023, compared with 16.8% for fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, Sales and marketing costs increased 40 basis points due to higher selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues. General and administrative costs decreased 20 basis points as a percentage of revenues.\nDuring fiscal 2023, we recorded $1,063 million in business optimization costs primarily for employee severance. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOperating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Revenues) for fiscal 2023 was 13.7%, compared with 15.2% for fiscal 2022.The business optimization costs recorded during fiscal 2023 reduced operating margin by 170 basis points. Excluding these costs, operating margin for fiscal 2023 increased 20 basis points to 15.4%.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 36\nOther Income (Expense), net\nDuring fiscal 2023, we recorded a gain of $253 million related to our investment in Duck Creek Technologies. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nEffective Tax Rate\nThe effective tax rates for fiscal 2023 and 2022 were 23.4% and 24.0%, respectively. Absent the business optimization costs of $1,063 million and related reduction in tax expense of $247 million, as well as an investment gain of $253 million and related tax expense of $9 million, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 23.9%.\nEarnings Per Share\nDiluted earnings per share were $10.77 for fiscal 2023, compared with $10.71 for fiscal 2022. The $816 million of business optimization costs, net of related taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $1.28 and the $244 million investment gain, net of related taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.38 for fiscal 2023. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share were $11.67 for fiscal 2023.\nOur operating income and diluted earnings per share are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related revenues. Where practical, we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related revenues, such as the costs associated with our global delivery model, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We seek to manage our costs, taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs. For more information on our hedging programs, see Foreign Currency Risk under Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 9 (Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFor fiscal 2023, we have presented effective tax rates and diluted earnings per share excluding the business optimization costs and investment gain, as well as operating income and operating margin excluding the business optimization costs, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of these items and our performance in comparison to the prior periods. While we believe that this non-GAAP financial information is useful in evaluating our operations, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nNew Bookings\nFiscal Percent\nIncrease (Decrease)\nU.S.\nDollars Percent\nIncrease (Decrease)\nLocal\nCurrency\n(in billions of U.S. dollars) 2023 2022\nConsulting $ 36.2 $ 37.9 (4) % (1) %\nManaged Services (1) 36.0 33.9 6 10\nTotal New Bookings $ 72.2 $ 71.7 1 % 5 %\nAmounts in table may not total due to rounding.\n(1)Previously referred to as our outsourcing business.\nWe provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large managed services contracts. The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, managed services bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings.\nInformation regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 37\nThe majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our remaining performance obligations disclosed in Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Accordingly, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition\nDetermining the method and amount of revenue to recognize requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct performance obligations and should be accounted for separately. Other judgments include determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time and the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion.\nWe measure progress towards completion for technology integration consulting services and some non-technology consulting services using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. Revenues, including estimated fees, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. The amount of revenue recognized for these contracts in a period is dependent on our ability to estimate total contract costs. We continually evaluate our estimates of total contract costs based on available information and experience.\nAdditionally, the nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including incentive fees. Many contracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable. Our estimates are monitored over the lives of our contracts and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical experience and other information available at the time.\nFor additional information, see Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nIncome Taxes\nDetermining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.\nWe apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. A change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs. We release stranded tax effects from Accumulated other comprehensive loss using the specific identification approach for our defined benefit plans and the portfolio approach for other items.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 38\nNo taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these indefinitely reinvested earnings. For additional information, see Note 11 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nAs a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions.\nRevenues by Segment/Geographic Market\nOur three reportable operating segments are our geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets. In addition to reporting revenues by geographic market and industry group, we also report revenues by two types of work: consulting and managed services, which represent the services sold by our geographic markets. Consulting revenues, which include strategy, management and technology consulting and technology integration consulting, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Managed services revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.\nFrom time to time, our geographic markets work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating geographic markets. Generally, operating expenses for each geographic market have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our geographic markets affect revenues and operating expenses within our geographic markets to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and managed services is not uniform among our geographic markets. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our geographic markets differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.\nWhile we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 7.

These increases were partially offset by declines in Communications & Media, High Tech, Banking & Capital Markets and Software & Platforms. Revenue growth was driven by the United States.\nEurope revenues increased 11% in local currency, led by growth in Industrial, Banking & Capital Markets and Public Service. Revenue growth was driven by Germany, Italy and France.\nGrowth Markets revenues increased 12% in local currency, led by growth in Chemicals & Natural Resources, Public Service and Banking & Capital Markets. Revenue growth was driven by Japan.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for fiscal 2023 increased $3,075 million, or 6%, over fiscal 2022, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 86.3% compared to 84.8% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to business optimization costs of $1,063 million recorded during fiscal 2023.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 40\nOperating expenses by category are as follows:\nFiscal\n(in millions of U.S. dollars) 2023 2022 Increase\n(Decrease)\nOperating Expenses $ 55,302 86.3 % $ 52,227 84.8 % $ 3,075\nCost of services 43,380 67.7 41,893 68.0 1,487\nSales and marketing 6,583 10.3 6,108 9.9 474\nGeneral and administrative costs 4,276 6.7 4,226 6.9 50\nBusiness optimization costs 1,063 1.7 - - 1,063\nAmounts in table may not total due to rounding.\nCost of Services\nCost of services for fiscal 2023 increased $1,487 million, or 4%, over fiscal 2022, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 67.7% from 68.0% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2023 increased to 32.3% compared to 32.0% in fiscal 2022. The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2023 was primarily due to lower labor costs, including lower subcontractor costs, partially offset by higher non-payroll costs, primarily for travel compared to fiscal 2022.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense for fiscal 2023 increased $474 million, or 8%, over fiscal 2022, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.3% over 9.9% during this period due to higher selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nGeneral and administrative costs for fiscal 2023 increased $50 million, or 1%, over fiscal 2022, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 6.7% from 6.9% during this period.\nBusiness Optimization Costs\nDuring fiscal 2023, we recorded business optimization costs of $1,063 million, primarily for employee severance. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOperating Income and Operating Margin\nOperating income for fiscal 2023 decreased $557 million, or 6%, from fiscal 2022. Operating margin for fiscal 2023 was 13.7%, compared with 15.2% for fiscal 2022. The business optimization costs reduced operating margin by 170 basis points. Excluding these costs, operating margin for fiscal 2023 increased 20 basis points to 15.4%.\nOperating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows:\nFiscal\n2023 2022\n(in millions of U.S. dollars) Operating\nIncome Operating\nMargin Operating\nIncome Operating\nMargin Increase\n(Decrease)\nNorth America $ 4,474 15 % $ 4,977 17 % $ (503)\nEurope 2,333 11 2,437 12 (105)\nGrowth Markets 2,004 16 1,953 16 51\nTotal $ 8,810 13.7 % $ 9,367 15.2 % $ (557)\nAmounts in table may not total due to rounding.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 7.

In addition, during fiscal 2023 each geographic markets operating income was unfavorably impacted by business optimization costs. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates where significant for fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022:\nNorth America operating income decreased as revenue growth was more than offset by higher labor costs, including an increase in selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues.\nEurope operating income increased due to revenue growth in local currency, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates.\nGrowth Markets operating income increased primarily due to higher contract profitability and revenue growth in local currency, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates.\nInterest Income\nInterest income for fiscal 2023 was $280 million, an increase of $235 million over fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During fiscal 2023, Other income (expense) increased $169 million over fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher gains on investments, partially offset by foreign currency exchange losses. For additional information on investments, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nLoss on Disposition of Russia Business\nWe recorded a loss from the disposal of our business in Russia of $96 million during fiscal 2022.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 23.4%, compared with 24.0% for fiscal 2022. Absent the business optimization costs of $1,063 million and related reduction in tax expense of $247 million, and the investment gain of $253 million and related tax expense of $9 million, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 23.9%.The slightly lower effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was primarily due to lower tax expense from the geographic distribution of earnings, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based payments. For additional information, see Note 11 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiary. See Business-Organizational Structure. Noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 42\nEarnings Per Share\nDiluted earnings per share were $10.77 for fiscal 2023, compared with $10.71 for fiscal 2022. The $816 million of business optimization costs, net of related taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $1.28 and the $244 million investment gain, net of related taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.38 for fiscal 2023. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share were $11.67 for fiscal 2023. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe increase in diluted earnings per share is due to the following factors:\nEarnings Per Share Fiscal 2023\nFY22 As Reported $ 10.71\nHigher revenue and operating results 0.60\nHigher non-operating income (excluding loss on disposition of Russia business) 0.18\nLoss on disposition of Russia business recorded in fiscal 2022 0.15\nLower share count 0.08\nHigher effective tax rate (excluding loss on disposition of Russia business) (0.02)\nHigher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.03)\nFY23 As Adjusted $ 11.67\nGain on an investment, net of tax 0.38\nBusiness optimization costs (1.28)\nFY23 As Reported $ 10.77\nResults of Operations for Fiscal 2022 Compared to Fiscal 2021\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended August 31, 2021 in Item 7 of Part II, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 43\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. We could raise additional funds through other public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things:\nfacilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends;\nacquire complementary businesses or technologies;\ntake advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or\ndevelop new services and solutions.\nAs of August 31, 2023, Cash and cash equivalents were $9.0 billion, compared with $7.9 billion as of August 31, 2022.\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table:\nFiscal Change\n(in millions of U.S. dollars) 2023 2022\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 9,524 $ 9,541 $ (17)\nInvesting activities (2,622) (4,261) 1,638\nFinancing activities (5,645) (5,311) (334)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (101) (248) 147\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,155 $ (278) $ 1,434\nAmounts in table may not total due to rounding.\nOperating activities: The $17 million decrease in operating cash flows were primarily due to higher spending on certain compensation payments, partially offset by higher collections on net client balances (receivables from clients, contract assets and deferred revenues).\nInvesting activities: The $1,638 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to lower spending on business acquisitions and higher proceeds from the sale of businesses and investments. For additional information, see Note 6 (Business Combinations and Dispositions) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nFinancing activities: The $334 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid as well as an increase in the net purchase of shares, partially offset by increases in net proceeds from share issuances and net proceeds from borrowings. For additional information, see Note 14 (Shareholders Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nWe believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.\nSubstantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. In addition, domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.\nShare Purchases and Redemptions\nWe intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2024. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. For additional information, see Note 14 (Shareholders Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 44\nSubsequent Events\nSee Note 14 (Shareholders Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nObligations and Commitments\nAs of August 31, 2023, we had commitments of $3.7 billion related to cloud hosting arrangements, software subscriptions, information technology services and other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Payments under these commitments are estimated to be made as follows:\n(in millions of U.S. dollars) Payments (1)\nLess than 1 year $ 973\n1-3 years 1,382\n3-5 years 1,186\nMore than 5 years 137\nTotal $ 3,678\n(1)Amounts do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients.\nFor information about borrowing facilities and leases, see Note 10 (Borrowings and Indebtedness) and Note 8 (Leases) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of these arrangements. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 45\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nAll of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties.\nCertain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges, the most significant of which are U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Chinese yuan, U.S. dollar/U.K. pound and U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery model. These hedges, the most significant of which are U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, Euro/Indian rupee and U.K. pound/Indian rupee, typically have maturities not exceeding three years and are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global delivery resources. For additional information, see Note 9 (Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nFor designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services. As of August 31, 2023, it was anticipated that approximately $3 million of net gains, net of tax, currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months.\nWe use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $856 million and $693 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2023 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments.\nEquity Investment Risk\nOur non-marketable and marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our investments.\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies which are often in a start-up or development stage, which is inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The evaluations of privately held companies are based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. We have minimal exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as of August 31, 2023.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 46\nWe record our marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market values.\nThe carrying values of our investments accounted for under the equity method generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes; however, these investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nSee the Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and financial statements commencing on page, which are incorporated herein by reference. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\ni.pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures 47\nii.provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our Board of Directors; and\niii.provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nDue to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nKPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued its attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. See Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on page.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nEstimated costs to complete certain technology integration consulting services contracts\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services where the Company designs, builds, and implements new or enhanced system applications and related processes for its clients are recognized over time since control of the system is transferred continuously to the client. Generally, revenue is recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying the Companys performance obligations, which typically occurs over time periods ranging from six months to two years.\nWe identified the evaluation of estimated costs to complete certain technology integration consulting services contracts as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the estimate of costs to complete the contracts.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Companys process for estimating costs to complete technology integration consulting services contracts, including controls over the estimate of costs to complete the contracts. We tested the estimated costs to complete for certain technology integration consulting services contracts by evaluating:\nthe scope of the work and timing of delivery for consistency with the underlying contractual terms;\nthe estimated costs to complete in relation to progress toward satisfying the Companys performance obligations, based on internal and customer-facing information;\nchanges to estimated costs, if any, including the amount and timing of the change based on internal information or contractual changes; and\nactual costs incurred subsequent to the balance sheet date to assess if they were consistent with the estimate for that time period.\nWe evaluated the Companys ability to estimate costs by comparing estimates developed at contract inception to actual costs ultimately incurred to satisfy the performance obligation.\nUnrecognized tax benefits\nAs discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has $1,744 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of August 31, 2023. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes tax positions when it believes such positions are more likely than not of being sustained if challenged. Recognized tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. The Company uses estimates and assumptions in determining the amount of unrecognized tax benefits.\nWe identified the evaluation of the Companys unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing and certain other intercompany transactions as a critical audit matter. Complex auditor judgment was required in evaluating the Companys interpretation of tax law and its analysis of the recognition and measurement of its tax positions.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Companys unrecognized tax benefits process, including controls over transfer pricing and certain other intercompany transactions. We involved tax and transfer pricing professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\nevaluating the Companys interpretation of tax laws and income tax consequences of intercompany transactions, including internal restructurings and intra-entity transfers of assets;\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nassessing transfer pricing studies for compliance with applicable laws and regulations;\nanalyzing the Companys tax positions, including the methodology over the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing;\nevaluating the Companys determination of unrecognized tax benefits, including the associated effect in other jurisdictions; and\ninspecting settlements with applicable taxing authorities.\nIn addition, we evaluated the Companys ability to estimate its unrecognized tax benefits by comparing historical unrecognized tax benefits to actual results upon the conclusion of examinations by applicable taxing authorities.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2002.\nChicago, Illinois\nOctober 12, 2023\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nAugust 31, 2023 and 2022\nAugust 31,\n2023 August 31,\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 9,045,032 $ 7,889,833\nShort-term investments 4,575 3,973\nReceivables and contract assets 12,227,186 11,776,775\nOther current assets 2,105,138 1,940,290\nTotal current assets 23,381,931 21,610,871\nNON-CURRENT ASSETS:\nContract assets 106,994 46,844\nInvestments 197,443 317,972\nProperty and equipment, net 1,530,007 1,659,140\nLease assets 2,637,479 3,018,535\nGoodwill 15,573,003 13,133,293\nDeferred contract costs 851,972 807,940\nDeferred tax assets 4,154,878 4,001,200\nOther non-current assets 2,811,598 2,667,595\nTotal non-current assets 27,863,374 25,652,519\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 51,245,305 $ 47,263,390\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nCurrent portion of long-term debt and bank borrowings $ 104,810 $ 9,175\nAccounts payable 2,491,173 2,559,485\nDeferred revenues 4,907,152 4,478,048\nAccrued payroll and related benefits 7,506,030 7,611,794\nIncome taxes payable 720,778 646,471\nLease liabilities 690,417 707,598\nOther accrued liabilities 1,588,678 1,510,925\nTotal current liabilities 18,009,038 17,523,496\nNON-CURRENT LIABILITIES:\nLong-term debt 43,093 45,893\nDeferred revenues 653,954 712,715\nRetirement obligation 1,595,638 1,692,152\nDeferred tax liabilities 395,280 318,584\nIncome taxes payable 1,313,971 1,198,139\nLease liabilities 2,310,714 2,563,090\nOther non-current liabilities 465,024 462,233\nTotal non-current liabilities 6,777,674 6,992,806\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nSHAREHOLDERS EQUITY:\nOrdinary shares, par value 1.00 euros per share, 40,000 shares authorized and issued as of August 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022\n57 57\nClass A ordinary shares, par value $0.0000225 per share, 20,000,000,000 shares authorized, 664,616,285 and 664,561,282 shares issued as of August 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, respectively\n15 15\nClass X ordinary shares, par value $0.0000225 per share, 1,000,000,000 shares authorized, 325,438 and 500,837 shares issued and outstanding as of August 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, respectively\n- -\nRestricted share units 2,403,374 2,091,382\nAdditional paid-in capital 12,778,782 10,679,180\nTreasury shares, at cost: Ordinary, 40,000 shares as of August 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022;

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nAccenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions across Strategy & Consulting, Technology, Operations, Industry X and Song. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North America, Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). We combine our strength in technology and leadership in cloud, data and AI with unmatched industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to help the worlds leading businesses, governments and other organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance citizen services-creating tangible value at speed and scale.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Accenture plc, an Irish company, and our controlled subsidiary companies. Accenture plc is an Irish public limited company, which operates its business through its subsidiaries.\nThe shares of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by persons other than us are treated as noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The noncontrolling interests were less than 1% as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAll references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to fiscal 2023 means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2023. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe account for revenue in accordance with FASB ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).\nPerformance Obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the client and is the unit of accounting in Topic 606. A contracts transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contracts transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach, under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service based on margins for similar services sold on a standalone basis. While determining relative standalone selling price and identifying separate performance obligations require judgment, generally relative standalone selling prices and the separate performance obligations are readily identifiable as we sell those performance obligations unaccompanied by other performance obligations. Contract modifications are routine in the performance of our contracts. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in the contract specifications, requirements or duration. If a contract modification results in the addition of performance obligations priced at a standalone selling price or if the post-modification services are distinct from the services provided prior to the modification, the modification is accounted for separately. If the modified services are not distinct, they are accounted for as part of the existing contract.\nOur revenues are derived from contracts for managed services, technology integration consulting services and non-technology integration consulting services. These contracts have different terms based on the scope, performance obligations and complexity of the engagement, which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts, fee-per-transaction contracts and contracts with multiple fee types.\nThe nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including incentive fees. Many contracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nvariability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. These variable amounts generally are awarded or refunded upon achievement of or failure to achieve certain performance metrics, milestones or cost targets and can be based upon client discretion. We include these variable fees in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee and it is not probable a significant reversal of revenue will occur. These estimates reflect the expected value of the variable fee and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical experience and other information available at the time.\nOur performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time. The majority of our revenues are recognized over time based on the extent of progress towards satisfying our performance obligations. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the contract and the nature of the services to be provided.\nManaged Services Contracts\nOur managed services contracts typically span several years. Revenues are generally recognized on managed services contracts over time because our clients benefit from the services as they are performed. Managed services contracts require us to provide a series of distinct services each period over the contract term. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed. When contractual billings represent an amount that corresponds directly with the value provided to the client (e.g., time-and-materials contracts), revenues are recognized as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms.\nTechnology Integration Consulting Services\nRevenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services where we design/redesign, build and implement new or enhanced systems and related processes for our clients are recognized over time as control of the system is transferred continuously to the client. Contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years. Generally, revenue, including estimated fees, is recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the client.\nNon-Technology Integration Consulting Services\nOur contracts for non-technology integration consulting services are typically less than one year in duration. Revenues are generally recognized over time as our clients benefit from the services as they are performed, or the contract, for which the related services lack an alternative use, includes termination provisions enabling payment for performance completed to date. When contractual billings represent an amount that corresponds directly with the value provided to the client (e.g., time-and-materials contracts), revenues are recognized as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are generally recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the client. For non-technology integration consulting contracts which do not qualify to recognize revenue over time, we recognize revenues at a point in time when the client obtains control of the promised good or service.\nContract Estimates\nEstimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored over the lives of our contracts, and recorded revenues and cost estimates are subject to revision as the contract progresses. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on a technology integration consulting contract, we recognize the loss in the quarter it first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in Receivables, Contract assets, and Deferred revenues (Contract liabilities) on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones. In limited circumstances, we agree to extend financing to certain clients. The terms vary by contract, but generally payment for services is contractually linked to the achievement of specified performance milestones. Our receivables are rights to consideration that are conditional only upon the passage of time as compared to our contract assets, which are rights to consideration conditional upon additional factors. When we bill or receive payments from our clients before revenue is recognized, we record Contract liabilities. Contract assets and liabilities are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\nFor some managed services contracts, we receive payments for transition or set-up activities, which are deferred and recognized as revenue as the services are provided. These advance payments are typically not a significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demands in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nthe other party failing to complete its obligations under the contract. We elected the practical expedient to report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.\nEmployee Share-Based Compensation Arrangements\nShare-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards expected to ultimately vest. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs from previous estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nWe calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We establish liabilities or reduce assets when we believe tax positions are not more likely than not of being sustained if challenged. Recognized tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. Each fiscal quarter, we evaluate tax positions and adjust the related tax assets and liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances. We release stranded tax effects from Accumulated other comprehensive loss using the specific identification approach for our defined benefit plans and the portfolio approach for other items.\nTranslation of Non-U.S. Currency Amounts\nAssets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at fiscal year-end exchange rates. Revenue and expense items are translated at average foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year. Translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are reported in the same manner as translation adjustments.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, including certificates of deposit and time deposits. As a result of certain subsidiaries cash management systems, checks issued but not presented to the banks for payment may create negative book cash balances. Such negative balances are classified as Current portion of long term debt and bank borrowings.\nAllowance for Credit Losses-Client Receivables and Contract Assets\nWe record client receivables and contract assets at their face amounts less an allowance for credit losses. The allowance represents our estimate of expected credit losses based on historical experience, current economic conditions and certain forward-looking information. As of August 31, 2023 and 2022, the total allowances recorded for credit losses recorded for client receivables and contract assets was $26,343 and $25,786, respectively. The change in the allowance is primarily due to immaterial write-offs and changes in gross client receivables and contract assets.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nOur financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, foreign currency exchange rate instruments and client receivables, are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. We place our cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange instruments with highly-rated financial institutions, limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conduct ongoing evaluations of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which we do business. Client receivables are dispersed across many different industries and countries; therefore, concentrations of credit risk are limited.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nInvestments\nAll available-for-sale securities and liquid investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered to be Short-term investments. Non-current investments consist of equity securities in publicly-traded and privately-held companies and are accounted for using either the equity or fair value measurement alternative method of accounting (for investments without readily determinable fair values). Investments are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment. If an investment is deemed to have experienced an other-than-temporary decline below its basis, we reduce the carrying amount of the investment to its estimated fair value.\nOur non-current investments are as follows:\nAugust 31, 2023 August 31, 2022\nEquity method investments $ 23,985 $ 164,164\nInvestments without readily determinable fair values 173,458 153,808\nTotal non-current investments $ 197,443 $ 317,972\nFor investments in which we can exercise significant influence but do not control, we use the equity method of accounting. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and our proportionate share of gains and losses of the investee are included as a component of Other income (expense), net.\nAs of August 31, 2022, our equity method investments consisted primarily of an investment in Duck Creek Technologies. On March 30, 2023, Duck Creek Technologies was acquired by Vista Equity Partners for $19.00 per share. As part of this transaction, we received proceeds of $400,355 and recorded a gain of $252,920 in Other income (expense), net during fiscal 2023.\nFor equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, we use the fair value measurement alternative and measure the securities at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nSee table below for summary of depreciation on fixed assets, deferred transition amortization, intangible assets amortization and operating lease cost for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFiscal\n2023 2022\nDepreciation $ 620,659 $ 591,748\nAmortization-Deferred transition\n339,139 280,093\nAmortization-Intangible assets\n440,957 438,897\nOperating lease cost 868,082 769,806\nOther 12,248 7,672\nTotal depreciation, amortization and other $ 2,281,085 $ 2,088,216\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:\nComputers, related equipment and software 2 to 7 years\nFurniture and fixtures 5 to 10 years\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of lease term or 15 years\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the fair value of net assets acquired. We review the recoverability of goodwill by operating segment annually, or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. Based on the results of our annual impairment analysis, we determined that no impairment existed as of August 31, 2023 or 2022, as each reportable segments estimated fair value substantially exceeded its carrying value.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, including deferred contract costs and identifiable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets or groups of assets is assessed based on a comparison of the carrying amount to the estimated future net cash flows. If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is considered impaired and a loss is recorded equal to the amount required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are generally amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives, ranging from one to fifteen years.\nOperating Expenses\nSelected components of operating expenses are as follows:\nFiscal\n2023 2022 2021\nResearch and development costs $ 1,298,657 $ 1,123,296 $ 1,118,320\nAdvertising costs (1) 100,652 119,202 171,883\nProvision for (release of) doubtful accounts (2) 3,856 (2,284) 6,199\n(1)Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\n(2)For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses-Client Receivables and Contract Assets.\nBusiness Optimization\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we initiated actions to streamline our operations, transform our non-billable corporate functions and consolidate our office space to reduce costs. We recorded $1,063,146 of business optimization costs during fiscal 2023, including $769,909 for employee severance and other personnel costs and $293,237 related to the consolidation of office space. Total business optimization costs by reportable operating segment are as follows:\nFiscal\nNorth America $ 464,879\nEurope 432,853\nGrowth Markets 165,414\nTotal business optimization costs $ 1,063,146\nWe continue to expect to record total business optimization costs of approximately $1.5 billion related to these actions, with approximately $450 million in fiscal 2024 related primarily to employee severance. The actual amount and timing of severance and other personnel costs are dependent in part upon local country consultation processes and regulations and may differ from our current expectations and estimates.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\n2. Revenues\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nSee Note 16 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nWe had remaining performance obligations of approximately $26 billion and $24 billion as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately 67% of our remaining performance obligations as of August 31, 2023 as revenue in fiscal 2024, an additional 13% in fiscal 2025, and the balance thereafter.\nContract Estimates\nAdjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for both fiscal 2023 and 2022.\nContract Balances\nDeferred transition revenues were $653,954 and $712,715 as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Deferred transition costs were $851,972 and $807,940 as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Deferred transition amortization expense for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $339,139, $280,093 and $297,216, respectively.\nThe following table provides information about the balances of our Receivables and Contract assets, net of allowance, and Contract liabilities (Deferred revenues):\nAs of August 31, 2023 As of August 31, 2022\nReceivables $ 10,690,713 $ 10,484,211\nContract assets (current) 1,536,473 1,292,564\nReceivables and contract assets, net of allowance (current) 12,227,186 11,776,775\nContract assets (non-current) 106,994 46,844\nDeferred revenues (current) 4,907,152 4,478,048\nDeferred revenues (non-current) 653,954 712,715\nChanges in the contract asset and liability balances during fiscal 2023, were a result of normal business activity and not materially impacted by any other factors.\nRevenues recognized during fiscal 2023 that were included in Deferred revenues as of August 31, 2022 were $3.9 billion. Revenues recognized during fiscal 2022 that were included in Deferred revenues as of August 31, 2021 were $3.7 billion.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\n3.

Leases\nAs a lessee, substantially all of our lease obligation is for office real estate. Our significant judgments used in determining our lease obligation include whether a contract is or contains a lease and the determination of the discount rate used to calculate the lease liability. We elected the practical expedient not to separate lease and associated non-lease components, accounting for them as a single combined lease component, for our office real estate and automobile leases.\nOur leases may include the option to extend or terminate before the end of the contractual term and are often non-cancelable or cancelable only by the payment of penalties. Our lease assets and liabilities include these options in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. In certain cases, we sublease excess office real estate to third-party tenants.\nLease assets and liabilities recognized at the lease commencement date are determined predominantly as the present value of the payments due over the lease term. Since we cannot determine the implicit rate in our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate on that date to calculate the present value. Our incremental borrowing rate approximates the rate at which we could borrow, on a secured basis for a similar term, an amount equal to our lease payments in a similar economic environment.\nWhen we are the lessee, all leases are recognized as lease liabilities and associated lease assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Lease liabilities represent our obligation to make payments arising from the lease. Lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and may also include advance payments, initial direct costs, or lease incentives. Payments that depend upon an index or rate, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), are included in the recognition of lease assets and liabilities at the commencement-date rate. Other variable payments, such as common area maintenance, property and other taxes, utilities and insurance that are based on the lessors cost, are recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period incurred.\nAs of August 31, 2023 and 2022, we had no material finance leases.

Financial Instruments\nDerivatives\nIn the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Derivative transactions are governed by a uniform set of policies and procedures covering areas such as authorization, counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Positions are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity analyses. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. We classify cash flows from our derivative programs as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Cash Flows Statements.\nCertain derivatives give rise to credit risks from the possible non-performance by counterparties. Credit risk is generally limited to the fair value of those contracts that are favorable to us, and the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk, based on the gross fair value of our derivative financial instruments that are in an asset position, was $104,420 as of August 31, 2023.\nWe utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. These provisions may reduce our potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of a counterparty and reduce a counterpartys potential overall loss resulting from our insolvency. Additionally, these agreements contain early termination provisions triggered by adverse changes in a counterpartys credit rating, thereby enabling us to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially decrease our realized loss on an open transaction. Similarly, a decrement in our credit rating could trigger a counterpartys early termination rights, thereby enabling a counterparty to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially increase our realized loss on an open transaction. The aggregate fair value of our derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position as of August 31, 2023 was $114,741.\nOur derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Fair values for derivative financial instruments are based on prices computed using third-party valuation models and are classified as Level 2 in accordance with the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements. All of the significant inputs to the third-party valuation models are observable in active markets. Inputs include current market-based parameters such as forward rates and yield curves. For additional information related to the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements, see Note 12 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash Flow Hedges\nCertain of our subsidiaries are exposed to currency risk through their use of our global delivery resources. To mitigate this risk, we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the forecasted intercompany expenses denominated in foreign currencies for up to three years in the future. We have designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges. As of August 31, 2023 and 2022, we held no derivatives that were designated as fair value or net investment hedges.\nIn order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally designated as a fair value, cash flow or net investment hedge by documenting the relationship between the derivative and the hedged item. The documentation includes a description of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the risk being hedged, our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge and the method for measuring hedge ineffectiveness. Additionally, the hedge relationship must be expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis.\nFor a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. The amounts related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services were net losses of $27,865, and net gains of $92,275 and $102,676 during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, was not material. In addition, we did not discontinue any cash flow hedges during fiscal 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nOther Derivatives\nWe also use foreign currency forward contracts, which have not been designated as hedges, to hedge balance sheet exposures, such as intercompany loans. These instruments are generally short-term in nature, with typical maturities of less than one year, and are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives were net losses of $135,586, $168,625 and $15,370 for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items.\nFair Value of Derivative Instruments\nThe notional and fair values of all derivative instruments are as follows:\nAugust 31, 2023 August 31, 2022\nAssets\nCash Flow Hedges\nOther current assets $ 52,995 $ 89,867\nOther non-current assets 44,739 69,209\nOther Derivatives\nOther current assets 6,686 8,657\nTotal assets $ 104,420 $ 167,733\nLiabilities\nCash Flow Hedges\nOther accrued liabilities $ 50,020 $ 61,156\nOther non-current liabilities 26,076 42,537\nOther Derivatives\nOther accrued liabilities 38,645 83,792\nTotal liabilities $ 114,741 $ 187,485\nTotal fair value $ (10,321) $ (19,752)\nTotal notional value $ 13,390,031 $ 11,095,604\nWe utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements is as follows:\nAugust 31, 2023 August 31, 2022\nNet derivative assets $ 50,528 $ 140,073\nNet derivative liabilities 60,849 159,825\nTotal fair value $ (10,321) $ (19,752)\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\n10. Borrowings and Indebtedness\nAs of August 31, 2023 and 2022, we had total outstanding debt of $147,903 and $55,068, respectively.\nAs of August 31, 2023, we had the following borrowing facilities:\nCredit Facilities\nSyndicated loan facility (1) $ 3,000,000\nSeparate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities (2) 1,777,938\nLocal guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit (3) 246,818\nTotal $ 5,024,756\n(1)This facility, which matures on April 24, 2026, provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general corporate capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit and short-term commercial paper. Borrowings under this facility will accrue interest at the applicable risk-free rate plus a spread. We continue to be in compliance with relevant covenant terms. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees. As of August 31, 2023, we had $100,000 of commercial paper outstanding and backed by this facility, with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 5.4%. We did not have any commercial paper outstanding as of August 31, 2022.\n(2)We maintain separate, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities. These facilities provide local currency financing for the majority of our operations. Interest rate terms on the revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets. As of August 31, 2023 and 2022, we had no borrowings under these facilities.\n(3)We also maintain local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access our global facilities. As of August 31, 2023 and 2022, we had no borrowings under these various facilities.\nUnder the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $1,080,819 and $892,340 of letters of credit outstanding as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We also had $100,000 of commercial paper outstanding as of August 31, 2023. We did not have any commercial paper outstanding as of August 31, 2022. The amount of commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding reduces the available borrowing capacity under these facilities.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\n11.

If such earnings were distributed, some countries may impose additional taxes. The unrecognized deferred tax liability (the amount payable if distributed) is approximately $170,000.\nPortions of our operations are subject to reduced tax rates or are free of tax under various tax holidays which expire in fiscal 2031. The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries were estimated to be approximately $40,000, $29,000 and $37,000 in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to enacted changes in tax laws and tax rates did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal 2023, 2022, or 2021.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nThe components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities included the following:\nAugust 31, 2023 August 31, 2022 (1)\nDeferred tax assets\nPensions $ 518,782 $ 501,475\nCompensation and benefits 909,894 930,284\nShare-based compensation 518,126 436,740\nTax credit carryforwards 1,380,841 940,640\nNet operating loss carryforwards 172,690 180,610\nDeferred amortization deductions 842,471 852,513\nIndirect effects of unrecognized tax benefits 315,145 356,841\nLicenses and other intangibles 1,089,720 1,322,464\nLeases 715,393 759,399\nCapitalized research costs 363,135 -\nOther 657,346 477,143\nTotal deferred tax assets 7,483,543 6,758,109\nValuation allowance (1,480,678) (1,056,022)\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 6,002,865 5,702,087\nDeferred tax liabilities\nPensions (205,411) (146,553)\nRevenue recognition (77,864) (106,580)\nInvestments in subsidiaries (176,539) (162,873)\nIntangibles (647,477) (581,105)\nLeases (625,190) (687,428)\nOther (510,786) (334,932)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (2,243,267) (2,019,471)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 3,759,598 $ 3,682,616\n(1)Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.\nWe recorded valuation allowances of $1,480,678 and $1,056,022 as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, against deferred tax assets principally associated with certain tax credit and tax net operating loss carryforwards, as we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized. For all other deferred tax assets, we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we recorded net increases of $424,656 and $54,777 in the valuation allowance, respectively, primarily related to valuation allowances on certain tax credit carryforwards, as we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized.\nWe had tax credit carryforwards as of August 31, 2023 of $1,380,841, of which $31,995 will expire between 2024 and 2033, $336 will expire between 2034 and 2043, and $1,348,510 has an indefinite carryforward period. We had net operating loss carryforwards as of August 31, 2023 of $809,894. Of this amount, $200,928 expires between 2024 and 2033, $13,640 expires between 2034 and 2043, and $595,326 has an indefinite carryforward period.\nAs of August 31, 2023, we had $1,744,481 of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $1,289,173, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rate. As of August 31, 2022, we had $1,469,336 of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $1,083,065, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rate. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits as of August 31, 2023 and 2022 of $455,308 and $386,271, respectively, represent items recorded as offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nFiscal\n2023 2022\nBalance, beginning of year $ 1,469,336 $ 1,344,460\nAdditions for tax positions related to the current year 446,929 356,089\nAdditions for tax positions related to prior years 99,926 29,060\nReductions for tax positions related to prior years (152,799) (69,023)\nStatute of limitations expirations (72,039) (62,393)\nSettlements with tax authorities (60,292) (2,109)\nCumulative translation adjustment 13,420 (126,748)\nBalance, end of year $ 1,744,481 $ 1,469,336\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our Income tax expense. During fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized expense of $21,137, $25,369 and $35,285 in interest and penalties, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of $172,163 ($161,753, net of tax benefits) and $177,610 ($159,814, net of tax benefits) were reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs a global company, we file tax returns in multiple tax jurisdictions including the U.S. and Ireland. We have participated in the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) program since fiscal 2016. CAP tax years are examined by the IRS on a contemporaneous basis so that most issues are resolved prior to filing the tax return. The years from fiscal 2021 forward remain open for examination by the IRS. The years from fiscal 2019 forward remain open for examination by the Irish tax authorities. We are currently under audit in U.S. state and other non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. However, with limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to examination by those taxing authorities for years before 2015. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain and could result in significant cash tax payments, we do not believe the outcome of these audits will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately $358,000 or increase by approximately $572,000 in the next 12 months as a result of settlements, lapses of statutes of limitations, tax audit activity and other adjustments. The majority of these amounts relate to transfer pricing matters in both U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\n12. Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans\nDefined Benefit Pension and Postretirement Plans\nIn the United States and certain other countries, we maintain and administer defined benefit retirement plans and postretirement medical plans for certain current, retired and resigned employees. In addition, our U.S. defined benefit pension plans include a frozen plan for former pre-incorporation partners, which is unfunded. Benefits under the employee retirement plans are primarily based on years of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding retirement or termination of participation in the plan. The defined benefit pension disclosures include our U.S. and material non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans.\nAssumptions\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to determine the defined benefit pension obligations as of August 31 and the net periodic pension expense are as follows:\nPension Plans Postretirement Plans\nAugust 31,\n2023 August 31,\n2022 August 31,\n2021 August 31, 2023 August 31, 2022 August 31, 2021\nU.S.\nPlans Non-U.S. Plans U.S.\nPlans Non-U.S. Plans U.S.\nPlans Non-U.S. Plans U.S. and Non-U.S. Plans U.S. and Non-U.S. Plans U.S. and Non-U.S. Plans\nDiscount rate for determining projected benefit obligation 5.00 % 4.68 % 4.25 % 3.99 % 2.50 % 2.41 % 5.00 % 4.28 % 2.53 %\nDiscount rate for determining net periodic pension expense 4.25 % 3.99 % 2.50 % 2.41 % 2.50 % 2.27 % 4.28 % 2.53 % 2.51 %\nLong term rate of return on plan assets 3.50 % 3.19 % 3.50 % 2.23 % 3.50 % 2.63 % 2.88 % 2.89 % 3.06 %\nRate of increase in future compensation for determining projected benefit obligation 2.07 % 5.13 % 2.07 % 5.30 % 2.09 % 4.48 % N/A N/A N/A\nRate of increase in future compensation for determining net periodic pension expense 2.07 % 5.30 % 2.09 % 4.48 % 2.21 % 4.04 % N/A N/A N/A\nInterest crediting rate for determining projected benefit obligation N/A 1.59 % N/A 1.37 % N/A 0.77 % N/A N/A N/A\nInterest crediting rate for determining net periodic pension expense N/A 1.37 % N/A 0.77 % N/A 0.68 % N/A N/A N/A\nWe utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest cost components by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. This approach provides a correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and provides a precise measurement of service and interest costs. The discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as of the annual measurement date and are subject to change each year.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long-term returns on defined benefit pension and postretirement plan assets and is based on historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the asset portfolio.\nAssumed U.S. Health Care Cost Trend\nOur U.S. postretirement plan assumed annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of health care benefits is 6.7% for the plan year ending August 31, 2024.

The plans future prospects, their current financial conditions, our current funding levels and other relevant factors suggest that the plans can tolerate some interim fluctuations in market value and rates of return in order to achieve long-term objectives without undue risk to the plans ability to meet their current benefit obligations. We recognize that asset allocation of the defined benefit pension plans assets is an important factor in determining long-term performance. Actual asset allocations at any point in time may\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nvary from the target asset allocations and will be dictated by current and anticipated market conditions, required cash flows and investment decisions of the investment committee and the pension plans investment funds and managers. Ranges are established to provide flexibility for the asset allocation to vary around the targets without the need for immediate rebalancing.\nNon-U.S. Pension Plans\nPlan assets in non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans conform to the investment policies and procedures of each plan and to relevant legislation. The pension committee or trustee of each plan regularly, but at least annually, reviews the investment policy and the performance of the investment managers. In certain countries, the trustee is also required to consult with us. Asset allocation decisions are made to provide risk adjusted returns that align with the overall investment strategy for each plan. Generally, the investment return objective of each plan is to achieve a total annualized rate of return that exceeds inflation over the long term by an amount based on the target asset allocation mix of that plan. In certain countries, plan assets are invested in funds that are required to hold a majority of assets in bonds, with a smaller proportion in equities. Also, certain plan assets are entirely invested in contracts held with the plan insurer, which determines the strategy. Defined benefit pension plans in certain countries are unfunded.\nRisk Management\nPlan investments are exposed to risks including market, interest rate and operating risk. In order to mitigate significant concentrations of these risks, the assets are invested in a diversified portfolio primarily consisting of fixed income instruments and equities. To minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, plan assets allocated to debt securities appropriately match the duration of individual plan liabilities. Equities are diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. index funds and are intended to achieve long term capital appreciation. Plan asset allocation and investment managers guidelines are reviewed on a regular basis.\nPlan Assets\nOur target allocation for fiscal 2024 and weighted-average plan assets allocations as of August 31, 2023 and 2022 by asset category for defined benefit pension plans are as follows:\n2024 Target\nAllocation 2023 2022\nU.S.\nPlans Non-U.S.\nPlans U.S.\nPlans Non-U.S.\nPlans U.S.\nPlans Non-U.S.\nPlans\nAsset Category\nEquity securities - % 27 % - % 19 % - % 21 %\nDebt securities 100 35 95 43 97 50\nCash and short-term investments - 6 5 6 3 4\nInsurance contracts - 22 - 22 - 15\nOther - 10 - 10 - 10\nTotal 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 %\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.\nThe three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements is based on whether the inputs to those measurements are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. The fair-value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available and consists of the following levels:\nLevel 1-Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;\nLevel 2-Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets; and\nLevel 3-Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nThe fair values of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan assets as of August 31, 2023 are as follows:\nNon-U.S. Plans\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nEquity\nMutual fund equity securities $ 7,430 $ 188,796 $ - $ 196,226\nNon-U.S. corporate equity securities - 18,163 - 18,163\nFixed Income\nNon-U.S. government debt securities 192,484 88,274 - 280,758\nNon-U.S. corporate debt securities 17,568 - - 17,568\nMutual fund debt securities - 189,337 - 189,337\nCash and short-term investments 65,401 - - 65,401\nInsurance contracts - 68,569 180,353 248,922\nOther - 82,455 27,557 110,012\nTotal $ 282,883 $ 635,594 $ 207,910 $ 1,126,387\nThe level 3 assets are primarily invested in an insurance buy-in contract in a Non-U.S. plan.

Shareholders Equity\nAccenture plc\nOrdinary Shares\nWe have 40,000 authorized ordinary shares, par value \u20ac1 per share. Each ordinary share of Accenture plc entitles its holder to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture plc; however a holder of an ordinary share is not entitled to vote on matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture plc or to receive dividends.\nClass A Ordinary Shares\nAn Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder to one vote per share, and holders of those shares do not have cumulative voting rights. Each Class A ordinary share entitles its holder to a pro rata part of any dividend at the times and in the amounts, if any, which Accenture plcs Board of Directors from time to time determines to declare, subject to any preferred dividend rights attaching to any preferred shares. Each Class A ordinary share is entitled on a winding-up of Accenture plc to be paid a pro rata part of the value of the assets of Accenture plc remaining after payment of its liabilities, subject to any preferred rights on liquidation attaching to any preferred shares.\nClass X Ordinary Shares\nMost of our pre-incorporation partners who received Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares in connection with our transition to a corporate structure received a corresponding number of Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares. An Accenture plc Class X ordinary share entitles its holder to one vote per share, and holders of those shares do not have cumulative voting rights. A Class X ordinary share does not entitle its holder to receive dividends, and holders of those shares are not entitled to be paid any amount upon a winding-up of Accenture plc. Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the par value of the Class X ordinary share. Accenture plc has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder, as the case may be. Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding. Class X ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc.\nEquity of Subsidiaries Redeemable or Exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares\nAccenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares\nPre-incorporation partners resident in Canada and New Zealand received Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis. We may, at our option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange. Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder.\nShare Purchases and Redemptions\nThe Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.

Commitments and Contingencies\nIndemnifications and Guarantees\nIn the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project. In addition, our consulting arrangements may include warranty provisions that our solutions will substantially operate in accordance with the applicable system requirements. Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third-party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights.\nTypically, we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments we made in connection with arrangements where third-party nonperformance has given rise to the clients claim. Payments we made under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim, which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount.\nAs of August 31, 2023 and 2022, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $1,793,000 and $1,349,000, respectively, of which all but approximately $51,000 and $49,000, respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.\nAs of August 31, 2023 and 2022, we have issued or provided guarantees in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds of $1,294,653 and $1,116,298, respectively, the majority of which support certain contracts that require us to provide them as a guarantee of our performance. These guarantees are typically renewed annually and remain in place until the contractual obligations are satisfied. In general, we would only be liable for these guarantees in the event we defaulted in performing our obligations under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote.\nTo date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations, indemnification provisions, letters of credit and surety bonds, and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole.\nLegal Contingencies\nAs of August 31, 2023, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, except as otherwise noted below, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOn July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (Marriott) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. (Starwood), which was acquired by Marriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. On October 27, 2020, the court issued an order largely denying Accentures motion to dismiss the claims against us. On May 3, 2022, the court issued an order granting in part the plaintiffs motion for class certification, which we appealed. On August 17, 2023, the appeals court vacated the class certification and remanded the case to the district court for consideration of, among other things, the class action waiver signed by Starwood customer plaintiffs. We continue to believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. At present, we do not believe any losses from this matter will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nAfter Accenture Federal Services (AFS) made a voluntary disclosure to the U.S. government, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) initiated a civil and criminal investigation concerning whether one or more employees provided inaccurate submissions to an assessor who was evaluating on behalf of the U.S. government an AFS service offering and whether the service offering fully implemented required federal security controls. AFS is responding to an administrative subpoena and cooperating with DOJs investigation. This matter could subject us to adverse consequences as described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. We cannot at this time determine when or how this matter will be resolved or estimate the cost or range of costs that are reasonably likely to be incurred in connection with this matter.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\n16. Segment Reporting\nOperating segments are components of an enterprise where separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\nOur chief operating decision makers are our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Our operating segments are managed separately because each operating segment represents a strategic business unit providing consulting and managed services to clients across different industries.\nOur three reportable segments are our geographic markets, which are North America, Europe and Growth Markets. Amounts are attributed to geographic markets based on where clients are located. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, our Middle East and Africa market units will move from Growth Markets to Europe, and the Europe market will be referred to as our Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) geographic market.\nInformation regarding our geographic markets is as follows:\nFiscal 2023 North America Europe Growth Markets Total\nRevenues $ 30,295,587 $ 21,285,122 $ 12,531,036 $ 64,111,745\nDepreciation and amortization (1) 553,840 489,547 368,686 1,412,073\nOperating income 4,473,701 2,332,678 2,003,510 8,809,889\nNet assets as of August 31 (2) 4,091,045 2,527,587 1,006,414 7,625,046\nProperty & equipment, net 541,484 451,802 536,721 1,530,007\nFiscal 2022\nRevenues $ 29,121,385 $ 20,263,550 $ 12,209,370 $ 61,594,305\nDepreciation and amortization (1) 484,894 452,825 381,467 1,319,186\nOperating income 4,976,890 2,437,313 1,952,978 9,367,181\nNet assets as of August 31 (2) 3,981,668 2,331,300 1,127,828 7,440,796\nProperty & equipment, net 598,116 430,179 630,845 1,659,140\nFiscal 2021\nRevenues $ 23,701,341 $ 16,749,484 $ 10,082,564 $ 50,533,389\nDepreciation and amortization (1) 379,105 403,802 344,656 1,127,563\nOperating income 3,907,883 2,236,462 1,477,184 7,621,529\nNet assets as of August 31 (2) 3,141,318 1,564,660 862,755 5,568,733\nProperty & equipment, net 537,392 455,862 645,851 1,639,105\n(1)Amounts include depreciation on property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets and deferred contract costs controlled by each reportable segment, as well as an allocation for amounts they do not directly control.\n(2)We do not allocate total assets by reportable segment. Reportable segment assets directly attributable to a reportable segment and provided to the chief operating decision makers include receivables and current and non-current contract assets, deferred contract costs and current and non-current deferred revenues.\nThe accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur business in the United States represented 45% of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. No other country individually comprised 10% or more of our consolidated revenues during these periods. Business in Ireland, our country of domicile, represented approximately 1% of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2023 and 2022 and 2% during fiscal 2021.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)\nACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-K\nWe conduct business in Ireland and in the following countries that hold 10% or more of our total consolidated Property and equipment, net:\nAugust 31, 2023 August 31, 2022 August 31, 2021\nUnited States 33 % 33 % 27 %\nIndia 15 17 17\nIreland 2 6 7\nRevenues by industry group and type of work are as follows:\nFiscal\n2023 2022 2021\nIndustry Groups (1)\nCommunications, Media & Technology $ 11,452,914 $ 12,199,797 $ 9,801,349\nFinancial Services 12,131,531 11,810,582 9,932,523\nHealth & Public Service 12,560,458 11,226,464 9,498,234\nProducts 19,103,892 18,275,419 14,438,537\nResources 8,862,950 8,082,043 6,862,746\nTotal $ 64,111,745 $ 61,594,305 $ 50,533,389\nType of Work\nConsulting $ 33,613,008 $ 34,075,856 $ 27,337,699\nManaged Services (2) 30,498,737 27,518,449 23,195,690\nTotal $ 64,111,745 $ 61,594,305 $ 50,533,389\n(1)Effective June 1, 2022, we revised the reporting of our industry groups for the movement of Aerospace & Defense from Communications, Media & Technology to Products.
