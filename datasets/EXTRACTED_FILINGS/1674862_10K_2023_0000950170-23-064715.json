Ashlands Environmental, Health, Safety, Quality and Regulatory Affairs (EHSQ&RA) department has the responsibility to ensure that Ashlands businesses worldwide maintain environmental compliance in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This responsibility is carried out via training; widespread communication of EHSQ&RA policies; information and regulatory updates; formulation of relevant policies, procedures and work practices; design and implementation of EHSQ&RA management systems; internal auditing; monitoring of legislative and regulatory developments that may affect Ashlands operations; assistance to the businesses in identifying compliance issues and opportunities for voluntary actions that go beyond compliance; and incident response planning and implementation.\nFederal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment have a significant impact on how Ashland conducts its businesses. In addition, Ashlands operations outside the United States are subject to the environmental laws of the countries in which they are located. These laws include regulation of air emissions and water discharges, waste handling, remediation and product inventory, registration and regulation. New laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted by various regulatory agencies globally. The costs of compliance with any new laws or regulations cannot be estimated until the manner in which they will be implemented has been more precisely defined.\nAt September 30, 2023, Ashlands reserves for environmental remediation and related environmental litigation amounted to $214 million, reflecting Ashlands estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable, without regard to any third-party recoveries. Engineering studies, historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation. Environmental remediation reserves are subject to\nuncertainties that affect Ashlands ability to estimate its share of the costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site and the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of environmental remediation, Ashland currently estimates that the upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for identified sites could be as high as approximately $465 million. No individual remediation location is significant, as the largest reserve for any site is 21% of the remediation reserve. Ashland regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues. Environmental remediation expense, net of insurance receivables, amounted to $59 million in 2023 compared to $66 million in 2022 and $51 million in 2021.\nProduct Control, Registration and Inventory - Many of Ashlands products and operations are subject to chemical control laws of the countries in which they are located. These laws include regulation of chemical substances and inventories under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) in the United States and the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) regulation in Europe as well as new cosmetic ingredients filings in China under the Cosmetics Supervision and Administration Regulation (CSAR). Under TSCA, REACH, and CSAR additional testing requirements, documentation, risk assessments and registrations are occurring and will continue to occur and may adversely affect Ashlands costs of products produced in or imported into the European Union. Examples of other product control regulations include right to know laws under the Global Harmonized System (GHS) for hazard communication, regulation of chemicals used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and personal care products and that contact food under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act in the United States, the Framework Regulation in Europe and other product control requirements for chemical weapons, drug precursors and import/export. The Green Deal in the EU, specifically Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability, will require additional information to be developed on hazard communication and risk assessment of both chemical substances and finished products. New laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted by various regulatory agencies globally. The costs of compliance with any new laws or regulations cannot be estimated until the manner in which they will be implemented has been more precisely defined.\nRemediation - Ashland currently operates, and in the past has operated, various facilities at which, during the normal course of business, releases of hazardous substances have occurred. Additionally, Ashland has known or alleged potential environmental liabilities at a number of third-party sites. Federal and state laws, including but not limited to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and various other remediation laws, require that contamination caused by hazardous substance releases be assessed and, if necessary, remediated to meet applicable standards. Some of these laws also provide for liability for related damage to natural resources, and claims for alleged property and personal injury damage which can also arise related to contaminated sites. Laws in other jurisdictions in which Ashland operates require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and, if necessary, remediated to meet applicable standards.\nAir - In the United States, the Clean Air Act (CAA) imposes stringent limits on facility air emissions, establishes a federally mandated operating permit program, allows for civil and criminal enforcement actions and sets limits on the volatile or toxic content of many types of industrial materials and consumer products. The CAA establishes national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) with attainment deadlines and control requirements based on the severity of air pollution in a given geographical area. Various state clean air acts implement, complement and, in many instances, add to the requirements of the federal CAA. The requirements of the CAA and its state counterparts have a significant impact on the daily operation of Ashlands businesses and, in many cases, on product formulation and other long-term business decisions. Other countries where Ashland operates also have laws and regulations relating to air quality. Ashlands businesses maintain numerous permits and emission control devices pursuant to these clean air laws.\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has increased its frequency in reviewing the NAAQS. The USEPA has stringent standards for particulate matter, ozone and sulfur dioxide. Throughout 2022 and 2023, state and local agencies continued to implement options for meeting the newest standards. Particulate matter strategies include dust control measures for construction sites and reductions in emission rates allowed for industrial operations. Options for ozone include emission controls for certain types of sources, reduced limits on the volatile organic compound content of industrial materials and consumer products, and requirements on the transportation sector. Most options for sulfur dioxide focus on coal and diesel fuel combustion sources. It is not possible at this time to estimate the potential financial impact that these newest standards may\nhave on Ashlands operations or products. Ashland will continue to monitor and evaluate these standards to meet these and all air quality requirements.\nSolid Waste - Ashlands businesses are subject to various laws relating to and establishing standards for the management of hazardous and solid waste. In the United States, Ashlands facilities are subject to RCRA and its regulations governing generators of hazardous waste. Ashland has implemented systems to oversee compliance with the RCRA regulations. In addition to regulating current waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the storage of regulated substances in underground tanks. Ashland has the remediation liability for certain facilities subject to these regulations. Other countries where Ashland operates also have laws and regulations relating to hazardous and solid waste, and Ashland has systems in place to oversee compliance.\nWater - Ashlands businesses maintain numerous discharge permits. In the United States, such permits may be required by the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System of the Clean Water Act and similar state programs. Other countries have similar laws and regulations requiring permits and controls relating to water discharge.\nClimate Change and Related Regulatory Developments - Ashland has been collecting energy use data and calculating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for many years. Ashland evaluates the physical and transitional risks and opportunities from both climate change and the anticipated GHG regulations to facilities, products and other business interests, as well as the strategies commonly considered by the industrial sector to reduce the potential impact of these risks. These risks are generally grouped as impacts from legislative, regulatory and international developments, impacts from business and investment trends and impacts to Company assets from the physical effects of climate change. North American, European and other regional regulatory developments (most notably the pending SEC and approved Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) climate disclosure regulations) are monitored continuously for material impacts to Ashlands operations, and some facilities and subsidiaries are subject to promulgated rules. Proposed and pending climate legislation is monitored for impact and Ashland is taking steps to strengthen climate reporting to meet anticipated disclosure requirements. Other requirements requiring additional product level climate disclosures or supply chain transparency are also approved and in draft or finalized status and could impact the requirements for disclosure and restrictions on sourcing of raw materials. Regulations such as the PFAS restrictions and Microplastics ban in the EU have potential business interruption impacts where they limit the type and availability of raw materials that may be used.\nBusiness and investment trends are expected to drive an increase in the demand for products that improve energy efficiency, reduce energy use and increase the use of renewable resources. At this time, Ashland cannot estimate the impact of this expected demand increase to its businesses. Physical effects from climate change have the potential to affect Ashlands assets in areas prone to sea level rise or extreme weather events much as they do the general public and other businesses. Due to the uncertainty of these matters, Ashland cannot estimate the impact at this time of GHG-related developments on its operations or financial condition.\nCompetition\nAshland competes in the highly fragmented additives and specialty ingredients industries. The participants in these industries offer a varied and broad array of product lines designed to meet specific customer requirements. Participants compete with service and product offerings on a global, regional and/or local level subject to the nature of the businesses and products, as well as the end-markets and customers served. Competition is based on several key criteria, including product performance and quality, product price, product availability and security of supply, responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers, customer service, industry knowledge and technical capability. Certain key competitors are significantly larger than Ashland and have greater financial resources, leading to greater operating and financial flexibility. The industry has become increasingly global as participants have focused on establishing and maintaining leadership positions outside of their home markets. Many of these segments product lines face domestic and international competition, due to industry consolidation, pricing pressures and competing technologies. To improve its competitive position, as Ashland narrows its focus, the Company is building and leveraging the Ashland corporate brand as a differentiator to create value and better communicate the capabilities, promise and scale of the Company, making it easier to introduce new product lines and applications.\nIntellectual Property\nAshland has a broad intellectual property portfolio which is an important component of its business. Ashland relies on patents, trade secrets, formulae and know-how to protect and differentiate its products and technologies. In addition, the reportable segments own valuable trademarks which identify and differentiate its products from its competitors. Ashland also uses licensed intellectual property rights from third-parties.\nRaw Materials and Energy\nAshland purchases its raw materials from multiple sources of supply in the United States and other countries. Raw material supplies were available in quantities sufficient to meet demand in fiscal 2023, which was a significant improvement over fiscal 2022 when raw and packaging materials were globally constrained. Similarly, energy costs, which are a significant component of production costs, stabilized in fiscal 2023 after significant volatility in 2022.\nResearch and Development\nAshlands program of research and development is focused on defining the needs of the marketplace and framing those needs into technology platforms. Ashland has the capability to develop and deliver the intellectual property required to grow and protect those platforms. Ashland is focused on developing new chemistries, market-changing technologies and customer driven solutions at numerous technology centers located in the Americas, Europe and the Asia Pacific regions.\nSeasonality\nAshlands business may vary due to seasonality. Ashlands business units typically experience stronger demand during warmer weather months.\nHuman Capital\nEmployee Health and Safety - Cultivating a safety culture is intentional at Ashland and is best shown by its commitment to a Zero Incident Culture (ZIC). ZIC begins with the vision, values, beliefs, and actions of Ashlands leaders demonstrating that zero incidents is possible. It means developing processes where compliance is the minimum expectation, allowing employees to proactively manage safety above compliance on the journey to zero.\nAs an indication of its commitment to Responsible Care, Ashland obtained a third-party certification to RC14001, which includes the internationally recognized ISO 14001 certification and adds additional health, safety, security, and chemical industry requirements. Currently, Ashland has 24 international sites participating on a group RC14001 certification. Also, as part of its commitment to health and safety, 16 of the Company's sites have obtained an additional ISO 45001 certification, an international health and safety management system.\nAs part of ZIC, the Company strives every day to achieve zero incidents. Ashland continues to make good progress on its journey. For the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company had a Total Preventable Recordable Rate (TPRR) of 0.39 compared to 0.58 for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nAshland has implemented several tools for communicating lessons learned from injuries, process safety incidents, and environmental releases. Immediately following an event, flash reports are developed and shared to communicate key lessons learned across the Company with a review call within 48 hours with EHS and Operations Leadership. Additionally, incidents and root causes/corrective and preventive actions are reviewed monthly with Company leadership and EHS leaders globally to discuss areas for improvement and highlight the importance of identifying and addressing management system errors.\nAshland has implemented the Good Catch Program aimed at identifying underlying unsafe conditions or behaviors that could lead to an undesirable outcome. Employees are encouraged to report good catches that fall into one of three categories - substandard conditions, near misses, and suggestions. These are tracked with the goal of continuing to increase overall reporting of identified good catches year to year.\nEnvironmental - Ashland has a conscious and proactive mindset for sustainability and has established a renewable annual trust for ongoing and future environmental remediation and related litigation cash outlays. The initiative follows Ashland's announcement in February 2021 to align its operations with the ambitious aim of the Paris Climate Accord to limit global\ntemperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C above preindustrial levels. At that time, Ashland also became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact and is making the United Nations principles part of the Company's business strategy, culture, and day-to-day operations. Ashland has targets to reduce its environmental footprint (including energy usage, GHG emissions, and hazardous waste generation). These targets and progress towards meeting them can be found on: https://www.ashland.com/esg/esg-overview, which is not incorporated by reference into the Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHuman Capital Management - Ashland is committed to continuously evaluating and strengthening the growth-minded and innovative culture by attracting and developing exceptional global talent, supporting employees physical, emotional, and financial well-being, and recognizing and rewarding performance. To achieve the highest return, Ashland is building an inclusive and high-integrity organization where everyone belongs, feels inspired to excel, and does the right thing.\nAs of September 30, 2023, Ashland had approximately 3,800 employees who thrive on developing practical, innovative, and simple solutions to complex problems for customers in more than 100 countries. The employees global demographics consist of approximately 68% male employees and approximately 31% female employees, and in the U.S., approximately 26% of its employees self-identify as ethnically diverse.\nAshland's global footprint is geographically located as follows:\nCompetitive Pay and Benefits - Ashland is committed to paying its employees in a fair and equitable manner, regardless of race or gender, and has implemented global total rewards tools to promote equitable remuneration. The Company provides a total compensation package that is designed to be competitive with the markets in which it competes for talent. Ashland believes employees should be compensated equitably based on performance, skills, and experience.\nAshland reviews pay equity annually in conjunction with its annual performance review, merit, bonus and promotion processes. The Company annually completes an in-depth analysis of its pay equity globally using a number of factors to determine if a pay gap exists based on any protected factors (gender, age, race, veteran status). Overall findings continue to be encouraging, identifying only a few employees annually that had a disparity in pay requiring further analysis and corrective action. Ashland reviews each process annually to ensure that its policies, procedures, and training continue to provide pay equity within the Company.\nThe Companys compensation programs are globally aligned, and, where possible, its total rewards plans include base salary, short and long-term incentives, benefits, financial, and special recognition programs. The Company routinely reviews its total rewards practices in the markets in which it operates to ensure its plans allow for the recruitment and retention of the talent it needs to be successful.\nAshland also offers a competitive global benefits program to support employees through all life stages. The following benefit plans are available to employees depending on local markets in which the Company operates that include plan specific features such as on-site and on-demand resources:\nHealth care benefits including medical, prescription, dental and/or vision\nWellness initiatives:\noGlobal EAP (employee assistance program)\noFlu vaccination resources\nPaid time off\nVoluntary benefits\nLife and accident coverage\nDisability coverage\nRetirement plans\nTuition reimbursement\nBusiness travel accident\nInclusion and Diversity - In 2023, Ashland progressed its global inclusion and diversity strategy focused on belonging, accountability, community engagement, recruitment, and internal mobility. These priorities serve as the basis of the global and local objectives and initiatives that advance Ashland's collective progress towards equity. The company and its leadership team are committed to creating a collaborative environment that leverages the talents of a diverse global workforce to drive sustainable growth and innovation that creates value for its shareholders, customers, employees, and the communities in which it operates.\nAshlands commitment to inclusion and diversity starts at the top with its Board and its executive leadership. The Companys board of directors is comprised of individuals with diverse experience and credentials, selected for their business acumen and ability to challenge and add value to management. These directors have held significant leadership positions and bring a depth of experience across a wide variety of industries, providing the Company with unique insights and fresh perspectives. The demographics of the Companys board of directors is 60% diverse, including females and ethnically diverse males.\nThe Companys management is led by its President and Chief Executive Officer and the other members of the Executive Committee (EC). The demographics of the EC include 20% women and 50% males who identify as ethnically diverse individuals. The chart below shows the Companys global gender diversity and US ethnic and gender diversity progress over the past three years and the Companys future global gender diversity and US ethnic and gender diversity commitments.\nTalent Management - Ashland is dedicated to creating a purpose-driven people ecosystem that enables personal and professional growth at every level while minimizing risk to the business. The Company deploys a disciplined annual talent review and succession process to identify and develop a leadership pipeline that accelerates business results, promotes internal mobility, and minimizes attrition. The talent management process includes a performance management process that seeks to provide employees with on-going feedback to enhance their performance in support of the Companys business objectives. As part of Ashland's commitment to professional development, it offers associates and bachelors undergraduate, graduate, and PhD tuition assistance to eligible employees, along with ongoing technical and professional development.\nIn 2023, the Company elevated the skillset of its leaders to support the career development of their employees and provided continued learning on inclusion and allyship. Ashland conducted its second annual global Culture Survey, with 79% response rate, which provided valuable insight to prioritize investments in the tools, resources, and processes that will make a positive impact on employees well-being, engagement, and career growth. Ashland remains committed to continuously listening and evolving its people practices to align with and drive the Companys purpose and business success.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act).

The following discussion of risks is designed to highlight what Ashland believes are important factors to consider when evaluating its expectations. These factors could cause future results to differ from those in forward-looking statements and from historical trends.\nRisks Related to the Companys Business Operations, Financial Performance and Growth\nAshland has set aggressive growth goals for its businesses, including increasing sales, cash flow and margins, in order to achieve its long-term strategic objectives and improve shareholder value. Ashlands successful execution of its growth strategies and business plans to facilitate that growth involves a number of risks.\nAshlands failure to fully achieve one or more of its aggressive growth goals or meet its long-term objectives, could negatively impact Ashlands potential value and its businesses. One of the most important risks is that Ashland might fail to adequately execute its business and growth plans, by optimizing the efficient use of its physical and intangible assets. Aspects of that risk include changes to global economic environment, changes to the competitive landscape, attraction and retention of skilled employees, the potential failure of product innovation plans, failure to comply with existing or new regulatory schemes, failure to maintain a competitive cost structure and other risks outlined in greater detail in this Item 1A. In addition, Ashland, as part of its growth goals, continuously evaluates acquisition candidates. If Ashland is unable to successfully identify and integrate acquired businesses, Ashland could fail to achieve any expected increases in sales and operating results, which could have a material adverse effect on Ashlands financial results. Ashlands ability to achieve the anticipated financial benefits from any acquisition transactions may not be realized due to any number of factors, including, but not limited to, unsuccessful integration\nefforts, unexpected or underestimated liabilities or increased costs, fees, expenses and charges related to such transactions. Such adverse events could result in a decrease in the estimated fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets established as a result of such transactions, triggering an impairment. These and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBusiness disruptions from natural, operational and other catastrophic risks could seriously harm Ashlands operations and financial performance. In addition, a catastrophic event at one of Ashlands facilities or involving its products or employees could lead to liabilities that could further impair its operations and financial performance.\nBusiness disruptions, including those related to operating hazards inherent with the production of chemicals, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, supply or logistics disruptions, increasing costs for energy, temporary plant and/or power outages, information technology systems and network disruptions, cyber-security breach, terrorist attacks, armed conflict, war, public health crisis (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), fires, floods or other catastrophic events, could seriously harm Ashlands operations, as well as the operations of its customers and suppliers, and may adversely impact Ashlands financial performance. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrence or consequences of any such events, they could result in reduced demand for Ashlands products, make it difficult or impossible for Ashland to manufacture its products or deliver products to its customers or to receive raw materials from suppliers, or create delays and inefficiencies in the supply chain. In addition to leading to a serious disruption of Ashlands businesses, a catastrophic event at one of our facilities or involving our products or employees could lead to substantial legal liability to or claims by parties allegedly harmed by the event.\nFurthermore, because catastrophic events are inherently uncertain, Ashland's business continuity plans may not address every potential scenario and may not fully protect it from all such events. In addition, insurance maintained by Ashland to protect against property damage, loss of business and other related consequences resulting from catastrophic events is subject to various deductibles and coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of Ashlands damages or damages to others in the event of a catastrophe. In addition, insurance related to these types of risks may not be available now or, if available, may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable rates.\nClimate change and resource impacts including supply chain disruptions, operational impacts, and geopolitical events may impact Ashland's business operations.\nAshland sources a large number of raw materials from third party suppliers globally. These products include both natural and synthetic materials derived from plants, animal products, organic and petroleum based raw materials. Disruptions to the global supply chain due to climate related impacts or geopolitical events are possible and exist as external risk factors that the Company can respond to but not control. These events could limit the supply of key raw materials to the Company, or could have significant impacts to pricing. Ashland works with multiple raw material suppliers to mitigate lack of availability from a single supplier, however in some cases products with limited numbers of suppliers may become difficult to obtain.\nAshland has manufacturing operations in areas vulnerable to coastal storms which may increase in magnitude and impact due to climate change. Ashland continues to implement response and resilience measures such as storm hardening and business continuity planning, however increasingly large and unprecedented weather events may pose a risk to business operations in vulnerable areas. Storms could cause business interruptions, incur additional restoration costs, and impact product availability and pricing.\nConsumer preference is increasingly impacted by awareness of and a response to climate change. Consumers are increasingly demanding responsibly sourced and manufactured products. An inability to respond to consumer demands through environmental, social and governance (ESG) innovation could lead to a loss of sales to competitors providing more sustainable product offerings.\nEnergy availability and pricing has been impacted by geopolitical events and may be impacted by climate related legislation and regulations. As climate legislation increases in many countries, the availability of conventional and nonrenewable energy may be increasingly limited and prices may continue to increase. Where demand exceeds energy capacity, energy disruptions such as brown out or black out events are possible, leading to business interruption and quality/operational impacts. Failure to respond to or mitigate this risk could lead to increased cost and business impacts.\nGlobally, the availability of fresh, potable water is a growing concern, where water withdrawal can exceed the rates of surface and groundwater replenishment in critical basins, rivers, or other bodies of water. This concern continues to increase for Ashland and for the global supply chain where fresh water is a key resource for manufacturing operations. Failure to respond to this risk could lead to business interruptions and impact the availability and pricing of product.\nAshland sources several key natural raw materials that contain processed timber, palm, soy, and other harvested or farmed raw materials. Deforestation is an increasing concern where the irresponsible harvest of these raw materials can lead to loss of critical forests and habitats. Ashland has engaged in several supply chain certifications in an effort to source sustainable raw materials; however, the availability of these raw materials may be limited in the future. Additional sourcing of these materials is under increasing scrutiny due to deforestation. Failure to source responsibly and respond to or mitigate the risk could lead to business impacts and increased cost.\nAshlands customers could change their products in a way that reduces the demand for Ashlands products.\nAshland produces and sells specialty materials that are used by its customers for a broad range of applications. Many of these Ashland materials become part of end products that are sold to consumers. Changes in consumer preferences and demands can lead to certain Ashland customers making changes to their products. In other instances, Ashlands customers may change their products or production techniques to take advantage of newer technologies, alternative chemistries, more effective formulations, or improved processes, or in response to various market, technical or regulatory changes.\nSuch changes in Ashlands customers products or production techniques may cause these customers to reduce consumption of Ashlands products or eliminate their need entirely. Ashland may not be able to supply products that meet the customers new requirements. Such lost sales opportunities may not be replaced by those offering equal revenue potential or margin. It is important for Ashland to continue developing new products, and new applications of existing products to replace such lost business. Otherwise, Ashland faces the risk of a loss of market share, margins and cash flow if it is unable to manage a potential change in the demands of its products.\nAshlands substantial global operations subject it to risks of doing business in foreign countries, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGreater than half of Ashlands net sales for fiscal 2023 were to customers outside of North America. Ashland expects sales from international markets to continue to represent an even larger portion of the Companys sales in the future. Also, a significant portion of Ashlands manufacturing capacity is located outside of the United States. Accordingly, Ashlands business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, cultural, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions.\nThe global nature of Ashlands business presents difficulties in hiring and maintaining a workforce in certain countries. Fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided in foreign countries. In addition, foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax Ashlands foreign income, or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls. The imposition of new tariffs or trade quotas, or an impairment of existing trade agreements is also a risk that could impair Ashlands financial performance.\nCertain legal and political risks are also inherent in the operation of a company with Ashlands global scope. Ashlands ability to do business and execute its growth strategies could be adversely affected by legal and political changes or other changes to trade policy and trade relationships. Ashland could also be impacted negatively if the ongoing trade disputes between the United States and China, or those between the United States and the E.U. were to worsen. In addition, it may be more difficult for Ashland to enforce its agreements or collect receivables through foreign legal systems. There is a risk that foreign governments may nationalize private enterprises in certain countries where Ashland operates. In certain countries or regions, terrorist activities and the response to such activities may threaten Ashlands operations more than those in the United States. In Europe, the effect of economic sanctions imposed on Russia and/or Russias reaction to the sanctions could adversely impact Ashlands performance and results of operations. The risks associated with localized or regional armed conflict in many parts of the world remain high and could disrupt and/or adversely impact Ashlands businesses. Social and cultural norms in certain countries may not support compliance with Ashlands corporate policies including those that require compliance with substantive laws and\nregulations. Also, changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where Ashland operates, particularly in Europe, the Middle East and emerging markets, are a risk to Ashlands financial performance.\nAs Ashland continues to operate its business globally, its success will depend, in part, on its ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to its multinational operations will not have an adverse effect on Ashlands business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdverse developments in the global economy and potential disruptions of financial markets could negatively impact Ashlands customers and suppliers, and therefore have a negative impact on Ashlands results of operations.\nA global or regional economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit Ashlands ability to produce and sell products. Ashlands business and operating results are sensitive to global and regional economic downturns, credit market tightness, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates, inflation or changes in interest rates, sovereign debt defaults and other challenges, including those related to international sanctions and acts of aggression or threatened aggression that can affect the global economy. In the event of adverse developments or stagnation in the economy or financial markets, Ashlands customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, reduced demand for their products, cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing. As a result, existing or potential customers might delay or cancel plans to purchase products, which includes customer destocking of their own inventories, and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to Ashland in a timely fashion. Further, suppliers may experience similar conditions, which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to Ashland. A weakening or reversal of the current economic conditions in the global economy or a substantial part of it could negatively impact Ashlands business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to grow.\nAshlands substantial indebtedness may adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAshland maintains a substantial amount of debt. Ashlands substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things:\nrequiring Ashland to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on its debt, which would reduce the availability of Ashlands cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, execution of its growth strategy and other general corporate purposes;\nlimiting Ashlands ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of its growth strategy and other purposes;\nmaking Ashland more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and regulatory conditions and in its business by limiting Ashlands flexibility in planning for, and making it more difficult for Ashland to react quickly to, changing conditions;\nplacing Ashland at a competitive disadvantage compared with those of its competitors that have less debt and lower debt service requirements;\nmaking Ashland more vulnerable to increases in interest rates if debt is refinanced; and\nmaking it more difficult for Ashland to satisfy its financial obligations.\nIn addition, Ashland may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations to repay its indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet its other cash needs. If Ashland is not able to pay its debts as they become due, it could be in default under its credit facility or other indebtedness. Ashland might also be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies to repay indebtedness, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring its indebtedness or selling additional debt or equity securities. Ashland may not be able to refinance its debt or sell additional debt or equity securities or its assets on favorable terms, if at all, and if Ashland must sell its assets, it may negatively affect its ability to generate revenues.\nRisks Related to Competition\nFailure to develop and market new products and production technologies could impact Ashlands competitive position and have an adverse effect on its businesses and results of operations.\nThe specialty additives and materials industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements. In order to maintain margins and remain competitive, Ashland must successfully develop and introduce new products or improvements that appeal to its customers and ultimately to global consumers. Ashland plans to grow earnings, in part, by focusing on developing markets and solutions to meet increasing demand in those markets, including demand for personal care and pharmaceutical products which are subject to lengthy regulatory approval processes. The fast change in Ashlands industry and those of its customers necessitates that Ashland continue the development of new technologies to replace older technologies whose demand or market position may be fading. Ashlands efforts to respond to changes in customer demand in a timely and cost-efficient manner to drive growth could be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, including the inability to identify viable new products, successfully complete research and development, obtain regulatory approvals, obtain intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products. Due to the lengthy development process, technological challenges and intense competition, there can be no assurance that any of the products Ashland is currently developing, or could develop in the future, will achieve substantial commercial success.\nThe competitive nature of Ashlands markets may delay or prevent Ashland from passing increases in raw materials or energy costs on to its customers. In addition, certain of Ashlands suppliers may be unable to deliver products or raw materials or fulfill contractual requirements. The occurrence of either event could adversely affect Ashlands results of operations.\nRising and volatile raw material prices, especially those of hydrocarbon derivatives, cotton linters or wood pulp, may negatively impact Ashlands costs, results of operations and the valuation of its inventory. Similarly, energy costs are a significant component of certain of Ashlands product costs. Ashland is not always able to raise prices in response to such increased costs, and its ability to pass on the costs of such price increases is dependent upon market conditions. Likewise, reductions in the valuation of Ashlands inventory due to market volatility may not be recovered and could result in losses.\nAshland purchases certain products and raw materials from suppliers, often pursuant to written supply contracts. If those suppliers are unable to meet Ashlands orders in a timely manner or choose to terminate or not fulfill contractual arrangements, Ashland may not be able to make alternative supply arrangements. Also, domestic and global government regulations related to the manufacture, transport or import of certain raw materials may impede Ashlands ability to obtain those raw materials on commercially reasonable terms. Certain Ashland businesses rely on agricultural output of clary sage, aloe, guar, and cotton linters, and the availability of these materials can be severely impacted by crop yields, weather events, and other factors. If Ashland is unable to obtain and retain qualified suppliers under commercially acceptable terms, its ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely, competitive and profitable manner or grow its business successfully could be adversely affected.\nAshland faces competition from other companies, which places downward pressure on prices and margins and may adversely affect Ashlands businesses and results of operations.\nAshland operates in highly competitive markets, competing against a number of domestic and foreign companies. Competition is based on several key criteria, including product performance and quality, product price, product availability and security of supply, responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service, as well as the ability to bring innovative products or services to the marketplace. Certain key competitors are significantly larger than Ashland and have greater financial resources, leading to greater operating and financial flexibility. As a result, these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within the relevant industry, changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and changes in general economic conditions. In addition, competitors pricing decisions could compel Ashland to decrease its prices, which could negatively affect its margins and profitability. Additional competition in markets served by Ashland could adversely affect margins and profitability and could lead to a reduction in market share. Also, Ashland competes in certain markets that are declining and has targeted other markets for growth opportunities. Competitive and pricing pressures could also impact Ashlands production volumes, which can in turn reduce cost efficiency. If Ashlands strategies for dealing with declining markets and leveraging opportunity markets are not successful, its businesses and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nRisks Related to Human Capital\nAshlands success depends upon its ability to attract and retain key employees and the identification and development of talent to succeed senior management.\nAshlands success depends on its ability to attract and retain key personnel, and Ashland relies heavily on its management team. Therefore, Ashlands future success depends, in part, on its ability to identify and develop talent to succeed its senior management and other key positions throughout the organization. If Ashland fails to identify and develop successors, the Company is at risk of being harmed by the departures of these key employees. The inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss, voluntarily or otherwise, of key personnel may adversely affect Ashlands operations. Monitoring and preventing unwanted employee turnover in positions that require certain technical expertise or those that have been identified as successors to senior management will be critical to Ashlands future success.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Cyber Threats\nAshland uses information technology (IT) systems to conduct business and these IT systems are at risk of potential disruption and cyber security threats.\nAshlands businesses rely on IT systems to operate efficiently and in some cases, to operate at all. Ashland employs third parties to manage and maintain a significant portion of its IT systems, including, but not limited to data centers, IT infrastructure, network, client support and end user services, as well as the functions of backing up and securing those systems. A partial or complete failure of Ashlands IT systems or those of our third parties managing, providing or servicing them for any amount of time more than several hours could result in significant business disruption causing harm to Ashlands reputation, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the nature of our businesses, the markets we serve, and the extensive geographic profile of our operations make Ashland a target of cyber security threats. Despite steps Ashland takes to mitigate or eliminate them, cyber security threats in general are increasing and becoming more advanced and could occur as a result of the activity of hackers, employee error or employee misconduct. A breach of our IT systems could lead to the loss and destruction of trade secrets, confidential information, proprietary data, intellectual property, customer and supplier data, and employee personal information. A breach could also expose us to customer litigation, regulatory actions and costs related to the reporting and handling of such a violation or breach, all of which could disrupt our business operations and could adversely affect Ashlands relationships with business partners, harm our brands, reputation, and financial results.\nAshland may not be able to effectively protect or enforce its intellectual property rights.\nAshland relies on the patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws of the United States and other countries to protect its intellectual property rights. The laws of some countries may not protect Ashlands intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Failure of foreign countries to have laws to protect Ashlands intellectual property rights or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could result in the loss of valuable proprietary information, which could have an adverse effect on Ashlands business and results of operations.\nEven in circumstances where Ashland has a patent on certain technologies, such patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competing technologies. In addition, any patent applications submitted by Ashland may not result in an issued patent. There can be no assurance that Ashlands intellectual property rights will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. Ashland could also face claims from third parties alleging that Ashlands products or processes infringe on their proprietary rights. If Ashland is found liable for infringement, it could be responsible for significant damages, prohibited from using certain products or processes or required to modify certain products and processes. Any such infringement liability could adversely affect Ashlands product and service offerings, profitability and results of operations.\nAshland also has substantial intellectual property associated with its know-how and trade secrets that are not protected by patent or copyright laws. Ashland protects these rights by entering into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with most of its employees and with third parties. There can be no assurance that such agreements will not be breached or that Ashland will be able to effectively enforce them. In addition, Ashlands trade secrets and know-how may be improperly obtained by other\nmeans, such as a breach of Ashlands information technologies security systems or direct theft. Any unauthorized disclosure of any of Ashlands material know-how or trade secrets could adversely affect Ashlands business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Compliance and Litigation\nAshlands business exposes it to potential product liability claims and recalls, which could adversely affect its financial condition and performance.\nThe development, manufacture and sale of specialty materials and other products by Ashland, including products produced for the food, beverage, personal care, pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement industries, involve an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, product recalls, product seizures and related adverse publicity. Ashland also produces products that are subject to rigorous specifications and quality standards, with an expectation from its customers around these strict requirements. A product liability claim, recall or judgment against Ashland, or a customer complaint on product specifications, could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, affect consumer or customer confidence in its products, and divert managements attention from other responsibilities. Although Ashland maintains product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that this type or level of coverage is adequate or that Ashland will be able to continue to maintain its existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. A product recall or a partially or completely uninsured product liability judgment against Ashland could have a material adverse effect on its reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nAshland has incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial costs as a result of environmental, health and safety, and hazardous substances liabilities and related compliance requirements. These costs could adversely impact Ashlands cash flow, and, to the extent they exceed Ashlands established reserves for these liabilities, its results of operations.\nAshland is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment and human health and safety, and the generation, storage, handling, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. Ashland has incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs and capital expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations.\nEnvironmental, health and safety regulations change over time, and such regulations and their enforcement have tended to become more stringent. Accordingly, changes in environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and the enforcement of such laws and regulations could interrupt Ashlands operations, require modifications to its facilities or cause Ashland to incur significant liabilities, costs or losses that could adversely affect its profitability. Actual or alleged violations of environmental, health or safety laws and regulations could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations as well as substantial damages, penalties, fines, civil or criminal sanctions and remediation costs. In addition, under some environmental laws, Ashland may be strictly liable and/or jointly and severally liable for environmental damages and penalties.\nAshland is also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts (collectively, environmental remediation) at multiple locations. Ashland uses engineering studies, historical experience and other factors to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation. Environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect Ashlands ability to estimate its share of the applicable costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site and the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, with varying costs of alternate cleanup methods. There may also be situations in which certain environmental liabilities are not known to Ashland or are not probable and estimable. As a result, Ashlands actual costs for environmental remediation could adversely affect Ashlands cash flow and, to the extent costs exceed established reserves for those liabilities, its results of operations.\nAshland is responsible for, and has financial exposure to, liabilities from pending and threatened claims, including those alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos, which could adversely impact Ashlands results of operations and cash flow.\nThere are various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings pending or threatened, including those alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos, against Ashland and its current and former subsidiaries. Such actions are with respect to\ncommercial matters, product liability, toxic tort liability and other matters that seek remedies or damages, some of which are for substantial amounts. While these actions are being contested, their outcome is not predictable. Ashlands results could be adversely affected by financial exposure to these liabilities. Insurance maintained by Ashland to protect against claims for damages alleged by third parties is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of Ashlands liabilities to others. In addition, insurance related to these types of risks may not be available now or, if available, may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable rates. Ashlands ability to recover from its insurers for asbestos liabilities could also have an adverse impact on its results of operations. Projecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict. In addition to the significant uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received, other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant, the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure, dismissal rates, costs of medical treatment, the impact of bankruptcies of other companies that are co-defendants in claims, uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards. Furthermore, any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. In light of these inherent uncertainties, Ashland believes that its asbestos reserves represent the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes. As a part of the process to develop these estimates of future asbestos costs, a range of long-term cost models was developed. These models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long-term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs, as well as other variables mentioned previously. Because of the inherent uncertainties in projecting future asbestos liabilities and establishing appropriate reserves, Ashlands actual asbestos costs could adversely affect its results of operations and, to the extent they exceed its reserves, could adversely affect its results of operations.\nThe impact of changing laws or regulations or the manner of interpretation or enforcement of existing rules could adversely impact Ashlands financial performance and restrict its ability to operate its business or execute its strategies.\nNew laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase Ashlands cost of doing business and restrict its ability to operate its business or execute its strategies. This includes, among other things, the possible taxation under U.S. law of certain income from foreign operations, the possible taxation under foreign laws of certain income Ashland reports in other jurisdictions, the Pillar Two initiative of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development which introduces a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis to Ashland in many jurisdictions starting October 1, 2024, tariffs or quotas levied on Ashland products, raw materials or key components by certain countries, regulations related to the protection of private information of Ashlands employees and customers, regulations issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (and analogous non-U.S. agencies) affecting Ashland and its customers, compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (and analogous non-U.S. laws) and the European Unions Registration, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation (and analogous non-EU initiatives), and potential operational impacts of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Uncertainty associated with the passage of new laws, application of executive authority beyond the legislative process, as well as changes in and enforcement of existing laws, can limit Ashlands ability to make and execute business plans effectively. In addition, compliance with laws and regulations is complicated by Ashlands substantial and growing global footprint, which will require significant and additional resources to comprehend and ensure compliance with applicable laws in the more than one hundred countries where Ashland conducts business. Compliance with current and future regulations is further complicated by uncertainty around the reevaluation of international agreements by various countries, including the United States, and the resulting impact on regulatory regimes, customs regulations, tariffs, sanctions, and other transnational protocols.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nImposition of new taxes, disagreements with tax authorities or additional tax liabilities could adversely affect Ashlands business, financial condition, reputation or results of operations.\nAshlands products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold in more than 100 countries and territories. A significant portion of Ashlands revenues are generated outside the United States. As such, Ashland is subject to taxes in the United States as well as numerous foreign countries. Ashlands future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in liabilities for uncertain\ntax positions, cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices or their interpretation. Moreover, because Ashland is subject to the regular examination of its income tax returns by various tax authorities, the economic and political pressure to increase tax revenues in these jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes even more difficult, and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation may differ from our historical provisions and accruals resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, reputation or results of operations. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), enacted in December 2017, made significant changes to US tax law; many other countries or organizations, including those where Ashland has significant operations, are actively considering or enacting changes to tax laws which could significantly impact our tax rate and cash flows. The increasingly complex global tax environment, including changes in how United States multinational corporations are taxed, could adversely affect Ashlands business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOther than the one-time transition tax enacted by the Tax Act, Ashland will continue to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign earnings. As such, Ashland has not accrued income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most non-US subsidiaries because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. If these earnings are needed for Ashlands operations in the United States, the repatriation of such earnings could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe final distribution of Valvoline shares could result in significant tax liability to Ashland and its stockholders.\nAshland believes that the final distribution of Valvoline shares should be a nontaxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Ashland has obtained a written opinion of counsel to the effect that the final distribution should qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). The opinion is based on certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters from Ashland and Valvoline, as well as certain covenants by those parties. The opinion cannot be relied upon if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or is violated in any material respect, or if there are changes in law with retroactive effect. The opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and it is possible that the IRS or a state or local taxing authority could take the position the final distribution resulted in the recognition of significant taxable gain by Ashland, in which case Ashland may be subject to material tax liabilities.\nIf the final distribution were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss, then Ashland would recognize gain as if it had sold Valvoline common stock in a taxable transaction in an amount up to the fair market value of the Valvoline common stock it distributed in the final distribution. The tax liability resulting from such gain could have a material impact on Ashlands operations. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nNot applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nAshlands corporate headquarters is located in Wilmington, Delaware. Principal offices of other major operations are located in Wilmington, Delaware (Life Sciences, Specialty Additives, Intermediates and Corporate); Bridgewater, New Jersey (Personal Care and Corporate); and Dublin, Ohio (Corporate) within the United States and Hyderabad, India; Warsaw, Poland; and Schaffhausen, Switzerland (each of which are shared service centers of Ashlands and house Corporate and direct business segment personnel). All of these locations are leased, except for the Wilmington, Delaware site which is owned. Principal manufacturing, marketing and other materially important physical properties of Ashland and its subsidiaries are described within the applicable business units under Item 1 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All of Ashlands physical properties are owned or leased. Ashland believes its physical properties are suitable and adequate for the Companys business. Additional information concerning leases may be found in Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThe following is a description of Ashlands material legal proceedings. Ashlands threshold for disclosing material environmental legal proceedings involving a governmental authority where potential monetary sanctions are involved is $1 million.\nAsbestos-Related Litigation\nAshland is subject to liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Such claims result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in 1990 in connection with the sale of Riley Stoker Corporation (Riley), a former subsidiary. Although Riley was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos, its industrial boilers contained some asbestos containing components provided by other companies.\nHercules LLC (Hercules) (formerly Hercules Incorporated), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Ashland, is also subject to liabilities from asbestos-related personal injury lawsuits involving claims which typically arise from alleged exposure to asbestos fibers from resin encapsulated pipe and tank products which were sold by one of Hercules former subsidiaries to a limited industrial market.\nAshland and Hercules are also defendants in lawsuits alleging exposure to asbestos at facilities formerly or presently owned or operated by Ashland or Hercules.\nFor additional detailed information regarding liabilities arising from asbestos-related litigation, see Managements Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies - Asbestos Litigation and Note M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEnvironmental Proceedings\n(a) CERCLA and Similar State Law Sites - Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state laws, Ashland and its subsidiaries may be subject to joint and several liability for cleanup costs in connection with alleged releases of hazardous substances at sites where it has been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP). As of September 30, 2023, Ashland and its subsidiaries have been identified as a PRP by U.S. federal and state authorities, or by private parties seeking contribution, for the cost of environmental investigation and/or cleanup at 57 sites. These sites are currently subject to ongoing investigation and remedial activities, overseen by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) or a state agency, in which Ashland or its subsidiaries are typically participating as a member of a PRP group. Generally, the types of relief sought include remediation of contaminated soil and/or groundwater, reimbursement for past costs of site cleanup and administrative oversight and/or long-term monitoring of environmental conditions at the sites. The ultimate costs are not predictable with assurance.\n(b) Lower Passaic River, New Jersey Matters - Ashland, through two formerly owned facilities, and International Specialty Products (ISP), through a now-closed facility, have been identified as PRPs, along with approximately 70 other companies (the Cooperating Parties Group or the CPG), in a May 2007 Administrative Order of Consent (AOOC) with the USEPA. The parties are required to perform a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) of the entire 17 miles of the Passaic River. In June 2007, the USEPA separately commenced a Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) as an interim measure. In accordance with the 2007 AOOC, in June 2012 the CPG voluntarily entered into another AOOC for an interim removal action focused solely at mile 10.9 of the Passaic River. The allocations for the 2007 AOOC and the 2012 removal action are based on interim allocations, are immaterial and have been accrued. In April 2014, the USEPA released the FFS. The CPG submitted the Draft RI/FS Report on April 30, 2015. The USEPA has released the FFS Record of Decision for the lower 8 miles and reached an agreement with another chemical company to conduct and pay for the remedial design. This chemical company has sued Ashland, ISP and numerous other defendants to recover past and future costs pursuant to the CERCLA. Ashlands motion to dismiss was partially granted, and the surviving claims are in the early stages of discovery. Ashland and ISP participated in an USEPA allocation process that resulted in a partial settlement with the EPA. Possible future allocation proceedings are not expected to have a significant impact to Ashland.\nFor additional information regarding environmental matters and reserves, see Note M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Pending Legal Proceedings\nIn addition to the matters described above, there are other various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings pending or threatened against Ashland and its current and former subsidiaries. Such actions are with respect to commercial matters, product liability, toxic tort liability, employment matters and other environmental matters which seek remedies or damages, some of which are for substantial amounts. While Ashland cannot predict with certainty the outcome of such actions, it believes that adequate reserves have been recorded as of September 30, 2023. There is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized may be incurred related to these actions; however, Ashland believes that such potential losses would not be material as of September 30, 2023.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nAshland profile\nAshland is a global additives and specialty ingredients company with a conscious and proactive mindset for environmental, social and governance (ESG). The company serves customers in a wide range of consumer and industrial markets, including architectural coatings, construction, energy, food and beverage, nutraceuticals, personal care and pharmaceutical. With approximately 3,800 employees worldwide, Ashland serves customers in more than 100 countries.\nAshlands sales generated outside of North America were 69% in 2023, and 68% in 2022 and 2021. respectively. Sales by region expressed as a percentage of total consolidated sales were as follows:\nSales by Geography\nNorth America (a)\n%\n%\n%\nEurope (a)\n%\n%\n%\nAsia Pacific\n%\n%\n%\nLatin America & other\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n(a)Ashland includes only U.S. and Canada in its North American designation and includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa in its Europe designation.\nReportable segments\nAshlands reportable segments include Life Sciences, Personal Care, Specialty Additives and Intermediates. Unallocated and Other includes corporate governance activities and certain legacy matters. The contribution to sales by each reportable segment expressed as a percentage of total consolidated sales for the year ended September 30 were as follows:\nSales by Reportable Segment\nLife Sciences\n%\n%\n%\nPersonal Care\n%\n%\n%\nSpecialty Additives\n%\n%\n%\nIntermediates\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\nM-1\nKEY DEVELOPMENTS\nUncertainty relating to the Ukraine/Russia conflict and Israel/Hamas conflict\nBusiness disruptions, including those related to the ongoing conflicts between Ukraine/Russia or Israel/Hamas continue to impact businesses around the globe. While it is impossible to predict the effects of the conflicts such as possible escalating geopolitical tensions (including the imposition of existing and additional sanctions by the U.S. and the European Union on Russia), worsening macroeconomic and general business conditions, supply chain interruptions and unfavorable energy markets, the impact could be material. Ashland is closely monitoring these situations and maintains business continuity plans that are intended to continue operations or mitigate the effects of events that could disrupt its business.\nAshland does not have manufacturing operations in Russia, Ukraine, or Belarus. Ashland sells (or previously sold) additives and specialty ingredients to manufacturers in these countries for their use in pharmaceuticals, personal care, and coatings applications. Sales to Russia and Belarus were previously limited and our products were primarily used in products and applications that are essential to the population's wellbeing and currently support our customers' humanitarian efforts. We have sales controls in place to ensure that future potential sales into the region are only to support critical pharmaceutical or personal hygiene products which are essential for the general population and in accordance with any applicable sanctions. Sales to Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus represent less than 1% of total consolidated sales and less than 1% of total consolidated assets (related to accounts receivable).\nAshland does not have manufacturing operations in Israel. Sales to Israel represent approximately 1% of total consolidated sales and less than 1% of total consolidated assets (related to accounts receivable).\nUncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic\nThrough fiscal 2023, Ashland did not experience any material adverse events related to the COVID-19 pandemic and has continued to maintain supply chains. The COVID-19 impact related to the China re-opening did negatively impact demand during the first half of fiscal 2023 for both the Specialty Additives and Personal Care business segments. Additionally, Specialty Additives was also impacted by extended unplanned plant shutdowns at its Nanjing, China, facility as a result of these same dynamics during the first half of fiscal 2023. Ashlands overall liquidity remains strong and Ashland is more than able to meet its operating cash needs and other investing and financing cash requirements at this time, including those necessary to grow the business as economic conditions improve.\nOther significant items\n2023 Stock repurchase program\nOn June 28, 2023, Ashland's board of directors authorized a new evergreen $1 billion common share repurchase program (2023 stock repurchase program). The new authorization terminates and replaces the company's 2022 stock repurchase program, which had $200 million outstanding at the date of termination. As of September 30, 2023, $1 billion remained available for repurchase under the 2023 stock repurchase program.\n2022 Stock repurchase program\nDuring May 2023, under the 2022 stock repurchase program, Ashland initiated a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan agreement to repurchase up to $100 million of its outstanding shares. The program was completed during June 2023, when Ashland paid a total of $100 million and received a delivery of 1.1 million shares of common stock.\nDuring March 2023, under the 2022 stock repurchase program, Ashland initiated a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan agreement to repurchase up to $100 million of its outstanding shares. The program was completed during April 2023, when Ashland paid a total of $100 million and received a delivery of 1.0 million shares of common stock.\nDuring February 2023, under the existing 2022 stock repurchase program, Ashland initiated a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan agreement to repurchase up to $100 million of its outstanding shares. The program was completed in February 2023, when Ashland paid a total of $100 million and received a delivery of 1.0 million shares of common stock.\nM-2\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONSOLIDATED REVIEW\nConsolidated review\nOverview\nKey financial results for 2023, 2022 and 2021 included the following:\n(In millions except per share data)\nchange\nchange\nNet income (a)\n$\n$\n$\n$\n(749\n)\n$\nDiluted earnings per share net income\n3.31\n16.41\n3.59\n(13.10\n)\n12.82\nIncome from continuing operations\n(13\n)\nDiluted earnings per share income from continuing operations\n3.13\n3.20\n2.82\n(0.07\n)\n0.38\nOperating income\n(161\n)\nEBITDA (b)\n1,342\n(923\n)\nAdjusted EBITDA (b)\n(131\n)\nAdjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations\nexcluding intangibles amortization expense (b)\n4.07\n5.70\n3.75\n(1.63\n)\n1.95\n(a)Fiscal 2022 includes a $726 million gain associated with the sale of the Performance Adhesives business.\n(b)These are non-GAAP measures. See \"Use of non-GAAP measures\" section below for reconciliations to U.S. GAAP.\nAshlands net income of $178 million ($3.31 diluted earnings per share) in 2023, $927 million ($16.41 diluted earnings per share) in 2022 and $220 million ($3.59 diluted earnings per share) in 2021 included income from discontinued operations of $10 million, ($0.18 diluted earnings per share) in 2023, $746 million ($13.21 diluted earnings per share) in 2022, and $47 million ($0.77 diluted earnings per share) in 2021. Fiscal 2022 included a $726 million gain recorded in discontinued operations associated with the sale of the Performance Adhesives business in February of 2022 and was the largest impact on net income between periods.\nResults for Ashlands continuing operations, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and operating income for 2023, 2022 and 2021 included certain key items that were excluded to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA and are quantified in the Use of non-GAAP measures section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These pre-tax key items totaled expense of $21 million in 2023, expense of $96 million in 2022 and expense of $56 million in 2021 impacting continuing operations. Continuing operations was also impacted by favorable discrete tax items totaling $44 million in 2023, $9 million in 2022 and $60 million in 2021 for various tax specific key items for uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances, restructuring and separation activity and tax reform related activity. The pre-tax key items impacting operating income totaled expense of $52 million in 2023, expense of $16 million in 2022 and $59 million in 2021. Excluding these key items, the decrease in continuing operations, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and operating income was primarily driven by lower sales volumes from customer de-stocking, partially offset by improved pricing associated with cost inflation pricing actions and favorable selling, general and administrative expense primarily driven by lower incentive compensation. The increase in continuing operations, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and operating income from fiscal 2021 to 2022 was primarily driven by higher product pricing and favorable mix, partially offset by higher costs from inflation and higher selling general and administrative expense primarily driven by higher incentive compensation. In addition, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was also impacted by common share reductions from repurchases of Ashland common stock in the amount of $300 million in 2023, $200 million in 2022 and $450 million in 2021. These common stock repurchases reduced the number of weighted average shares from 61 million diluted shares in 2021 to 56 million diluted shares in 2022 and 54 million diluted shares in 2023.\nAshlands Adjusted EBITDA was $459 million for 2023 compared to $590 million in 2022 (see U.S. GAAP reconciliation under Use of non-GAAP measures below). The $131 million decrease in Adjusted EBITDA from fiscal 2022 to 2023 was primarily driven by lower sales volumes from customer de-stocking, partially offset by improved pricing associated with cost inflation pricing actions and favorable selling, general and administrative expense primarily driven by lower incentive compensation. The $95 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA from fiscal 2021 to 2022 was primarily driven by higher product pricing and favorable mix, partially offset by higher costs from inflation and higher selling general and administrative expense primarily driven by higher incentive compensation. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (non-GAAP) excluding\nM-3\nintangibles amortization expense was also impacted by these key factors along with the impact of common share repurchases noted above.\nFor further information on the items reported above, see the discussion in the comparative Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) caption review analysis.\nStatements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) - caption review\nA comparative analysis of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) by caption is provided as follows for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n(In millions)\nchange\nchange\nSales\n$\n2,191\n$\n2,391\n$\n2,111\n$\n(200\n)\n$\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the change in sales between fiscal years 2023 and 2022 and between fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\n(In millions)\n2023 change\n2022 change\nVolume\n$\n(354\n)\n$\nCurrency exchange\n(21\n)\n(77\n)\nAcquisition (Divestiture)\n(3\n)\nPrice/mix\nChange in sales\n$\n(200\n)\n$\nSales for 2023 decreased $200 million, or 8%, compared to 2022. Lower sales volume of $354 million, primarily from customer de-stocking and the COVID-19 impact related to the China re-opening in the first half of fiscal 2023, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange of $21 million, were the main drivers of the decline. These declines were partially offset by favorable mix and favorable product pricing associated with cost inflation pricing actions, which increased sales by $178 million.\nSales for 2022 increased $280 million, or 13%, compared to 2021. Favorable volume, including the acquisition of Sch\u00fclke within the Personal Care reportable segment, and product pricing/mix associated with cost inflation pricing actions increased sales by $68 million and $289 million, respectively, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange of $77 million.\n(In millions)\nchange\nchange\nCost of sales\n$\n1,523\n$\n1,561\n$\n1,441\n$\n(38\n)\n$\nGross profit as a percent of sales\n30.5\n%\n34.7\n%\n31.7\n%\nFluctuations in cost of sales are driven primarily by the effects of challenges in shipping and logistics in the current year, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, raw material prices and energy, volume and changes in product mix, currency exchange, acquisitions and divestitures and other certain charges incurred as a result of changes or events within the businesses or restructuring activities.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in cost of sales between fiscal years 2023 and 2022 and between fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\n(In millions)\n2023 change\n2022 change\nVolume\n$\n(241\n)\n$\nCurrency exchange\n(9\n)\n(39\n)\nAcquisition (Divestiture)\n(1\n)\nOperating costs (plant)\nPrice/mix\nChange in cost of sales\n$\n(38\n)\n$\nCost of sales for 2023 decreased $38 million compared to 2022. Lower volume primarily from customer de-stocking, including the divestiture in Specialty Additives, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased cost of sales by $242 million and $9 million, respectively. This decrease was partially offset by higher operating costs, which includes costs associated with inventory control actions and inflation associated with plant manufacturing and shipping costs (as well as planned and\nM-4\nunplanned plant shutdowns and maintenance), and higher price/mix associated with other cost inflation increased cost of sales by $183 million and $30 million, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased 4.2 percentage points primarily as a result of lower sales volume and higher operating costs.\nCost of sales for 2022 increased $120 million compared to 2021. Price/mix, which includes cost inflation associated with plant manufacturing and shipping costs, and higher volume, including the Sch\u00fclke acquisition, and higher operating costs increased cost of sales by $91 million, $39 million, and $29 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by foreign currency exchange, which decreased cost of sales by $39 million. Disciplined pricing and mix actions by Ashland's commercial teams improved operating margins as gross profit as a percentage of sales expanded 3.0 percentage points during 2022.\n(In millions)\nchange\nchange\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n$\n$\n$\n$\n(28\n)\n$\nAs a percent of sales\n16.7\n%\n16.4\n%\n17.0\n%\nSelling, general and administrative expense for 2023 decreased $28 million compared to 2022, while expenses as a percent of sales increased 0.3 percentage points.

Tax specific key items are defined as the financial effects from tax specific financial transactions, tax law changes or other matters that fall within the definition of key items as previously described. The effective tax rate, excluding key items, which is a non-GAAP measure, has been prepared to illustrate the ongoing tax effects of Ashlands operations. Management believes investors and analysts use this financial measure in assessing Ashland's business performance and that presenting this non-GAAP measure on a consolidated basis assists investors in better understanding Ashlands ongoing business performance and enhancing their ability to compare period-to-period financial results.\nThe effective tax rates during 2023, 2022 and 2021 were significantly impacted by the following tax specific key items:\nUncertain tax position - Includes the impact from the settlement of uncertain tax positions with various tax authorities;\nValuation allowances - Includes the impact from the release of certain foreign tax credit valuation allowances;\nRestructuring and separation activity - Includes the impact from company-wide cost reduction programs, and the impact of the sale of a Specialty Additives facility; and\nOther and tax reform related activity - Includes miscellaneous state and foreign statute adjustments.\nM-7\nThe following table is a calculation of the effective tax rate, excluding the impact of these key items:\n(In millions)\nIncome from continuing operations\nbefore income taxes\n$\n$\n$\nKey items (pre-tax) (a)\nAdjusted income from continuing operations\nbefore income taxes\n$\n$\n$\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n(8\n)\n(38\n)\nIncome tax rate adjustments:\nTax effect of key items (b)\nTax specific key items: (c)\nUncertain tax positions\nValuation allowance\n-\nRestructuring and separation activity\n-\n(3\n)\nOther and tax reform related activity\n-\n(6\n)\nTotal income tax rate adjustments\nAdjusted income tax expense (benefit)\n$\n$\n$\nEffective tax rate\n(5\n)%\n%\n(28\n)%\nEffective tax rate, excluding key items (Non-GAAP) (d)\n%\n%\n%\n(a)See Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table disclosed below in this Management, Discussion and Analysis for a summary of the key items, before tax.\n(b)The tax rate specific to the jurisdiction in which the key item originates is used to calculate the tax effect of key items.\n(c)For additional information on the effect that these tax specific key items had on EPS, see the Adjusted Diluted EPS table disclosed below in this Management Discussion and Analysis.\n(d)Due to rounding conventions, the effective tax rate presented may not recalculate precisely based on the numbers disclosed within this table.\nM-8\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of tax specific key items within the statutory federal income tax with the provision for income taxes summary disclosed in Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(In millions)\nTax effect of key items computed at applicable statutory rate (a)\n$\n$\n$\nUncertain tax positions\nValuation allowance changes\n(8\n)\nOther and tax reform related activity\n(3\n)\n$\n$\n$\n(a)The tax rate specific to the jurisdiction in which the key item originates is used to calculate the tax effect of key items.\n(In millions)\nchange\nchange\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\nPerformance Adhesives\n$\n$\n$\n$\n(36\n)\n$\n(23\n)\nComposites and Marl Facility\n(1\n)\n-\n(3\n)\nAsbestos-related litigation\n(5\n)\n(14\n)\n(9\n)\n(5\n)\nWater Technologies\n-\n(3\n)\n(4\n)\nDistribution\n(4\n)\n(7\n)\n(5\n)\n(2\n)\nValvoline\n(6\n)\n(9\n)\nGain (loss) on disposal of discontinued operations\nPerformance Adhesives\n-\n-\n(726\n)\nComposites/Marl facility\n-\n-\n(4\n)\n-\nWater Technologies\n-\n-\n-\n(1\n)\n$\n$\n$\n$\n(736\n)\n$\nAs a result of the divestiture of the Performance Adhesives segment the related operating results have been reflected as discontinued operations (net of tax) within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).

See Note E for more information.\nIn 2022, a $1 million pension and postretirement obligation adjustment was recorded. See Note L for more information.\nUse of non-GAAP measures\nAshland has included within this document the following non-GAAP measures, on both a consolidated and reportable segment basis, which are not defined within U.S. GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of operating performance or cash flows:\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss), plus income tax expense (benefit), net interest and other expenses, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for discontinued operations and key items (including remeasurement gains and losses related to pension and other postretirement plans). Adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted EBITDA divided by sales.\nManagement believes the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures on a consolidated and reportable segment basis assists investors in understanding the ongoing operating performance by presenting comparable financial results between periods. Ashland believes that by removing the impact of depreciation and amortization and excluding certain non-cash charges, amounts spent on interest and taxes and certain other charges that are highly variable from year to year, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide Ashlands investors with performance measures that reflect the impact to operations from trends in changes in sales, margin and operating expenses, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income and operating income. The adjustments Ashland makes to derive the non-GAAP measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude items which may cause short-term fluctuations in net income and operating income and which Ashland does not consider to be the fundamental attributes or primary drivers of its business. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide disclosure on the same basis as that used\nM-10\nby Ashlands management to evaluate financial performance on a consolidated and reportable segment basis and provide consistency in our financial reporting, facilitate internal and external comparisons of Ashlands historical operating performance and its segments and provide continuity to investors for comparability purposes.\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS)\nAdjusted diluted EPS is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted for key items, net of tax, divided by the average outstanding diluted shares for the applicable period. The Adjusted diluted EPS metric enables Ashland to demonstrate what effect key items have on an earnings per diluted share basis by taking income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted for key items after tax that have been identified in the Adjusted EBITDA table, and dividing by the average outstanding diluted shares for the applicable period. Ashlands management believes this presentation is helpful to illustrate how the key items have impacted this metric during the applicable period.\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) Excluding Intangibles Amortization Expense\nThe Adjusted diluted EPS excluding intangible amortization expense is adjusted earnings per share adjusted for intangibles amortization expense net of tax, divided by the average outstanding diluted shares for the applicable period. The Adjusted diluted EPS, excluding intangibles amortization expense metric enables Ashland to demonstrate the impact of non-cash intangibles amortization expense on EPS, in addition to the key items previously mentioned. Ashlands management believes this presentation is helpful to illustrate how previous acquisitions impact applicable period results.\nFree Cash Flow, Ongoing Free Cash Flow and Ongoing Free Cash Flow Conversion\nFree cash flow is defined as operating cash flows less capital expenditures while ongoing free cash flow is operating cash flows less capital expenditures and certain other adjustments as applicable. Ongoing free cash flow conversion is ongoing free cash flow divided by adjusted EBITDA. These free cash flow metrics enable Ashland to provide a better indication of the ongoing cash being generated that is ultimately available for both debt and equity holders as well as other investment opportunities. Unlike cash flow provided by operating activities, free cash flow and ongoing free cash flow includes the impact of capital expenditures from continuing operations and other significant items impacting cash flow, providing a more complete picture of current and future cash generation. Free cash flow, ongoing free cash flow, and free cash flow conversion are non-GAAP liquidity measures that Ashland believes provide useful information to management and investors about Ashland's ability to convert Adjusted EBITDA to ongoing free cash flow. These liquidity measures are used regularly by Ashland's stakeholders and industry peers to measure the efficiency at providing cash from regular business activity. Free cash flow, ongoing free cash flow, and free cash flow conversion have certain limitations, including that they do not reflect adjustments for certain non-discretionary cash flows such as mandatory debt repayments. The amount of mandatory versus discretionary expenditures can vary significantly between periods.\nOther disclosures on non-GAAP measures\nAlthough Ashland may provide forward-looking guidance for Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted EPS and ongoing free cash flow, Ashland is not reaffirming or providing forward-looking guidance for U.S. GAAP-reported financial measures or a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items that affect these metrics such as domestic and international economic, political, legislative, regulatory and legal actions. In addition, certain economic conditions, such as recessionary trends, inflation, interest and monetary exchange rates, government fiscal policies and changes in the prices of certain key raw materials, can have a significant effect on operations and are difficult to predict with certainty.\nThese non-GAAP measures should be considered supplemental in nature and should not be construed as more significant than comparable measures defined by U.S. GAAP. Limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP measures include that these measures do not present all of the amounts associated with our results as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP measures provided are used by Ashland management and may not be determined in a manner consistent with the methodologies used by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide a supplemental presentation of Ashlands operating performance on a consolidated and reportable segment basis. Adjusted EBITDA generally includes adjustments for\nM-11\nitems that impact comparability between periods. In addition, certain financial covenants related to Ashlands 2022 Credit Agreement are based on similar non-GAAP measures and are defined further in the sections that reference this metric.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, Ashland recognizes actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year. Actuarial gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from the estimates used to allocate the change in value of pension and other postretirement benefit plans to expense throughout the year or when assumptions change, as they may each year. Significant factors that can contribute to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses include changes in discount rates used to remeasure pension and other postretirement obligations on an annual basis or upon a qualifying remeasurement, differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets and other changes in actuarial assumptions, for example, the life expectancy of plan participants. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA, which includes the expected return on pension plan assets yet excludes both the actual return on pension plan assets and the impact of actuarial gains and losses, provides investors with a meaningful supplemental presentation of Ashlands operating performance (see the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table for additional details on exact amounts included within this non-GAAP measure related to pension and other postretirement plans). Management believes these actuarial gains and losses are primarily financing activities that are more reflective of changes in current conditions in global financial markets (and in particular interest rates) that are not directly related to the underlying business. For further information on the actuarial assumptions and plan assets referenced above, see Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA totaled income of $419 million, $1,342 million and $482 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA results in the following table have been prepared to illustrate the ongoing effects of Ashlands operations, which exclude certain key items previously described. Management believes the use of such non-GAAP measures on a consolidated and reportable segment basis assists investors in understanding the ongoing operating performance by presenting the financial results between periods on a more comparable basis.\nThese operating key items for the applicable periods are summarized as follows:\nRestructuring, separation and other costs - Ashland periodically implements company-wide and targeted cost reduction programs related to acquisitions, divestitures and other cost reduction programs in order to enhance profitability through streamlined operations and an improved overall cost structure. Ashland often incurs severance, facility and integration costs associated with these programs. See Note D in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the restructuring activities.\nEnvironmental reserve adjustments - Ashland is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts (collectively environmental remediation) at multiple locations. As a result of these activities, Ashland recorded adjustments during each year to its environmental liabilities and receivables primarily related to previously divested businesses or non-operational sites. See Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nIncome on acquisitions and divestitures, net - Ashland recorded income of $6 million, $42 million and $11 million during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For 2023 and 2022, the income was related to the pre-tax gains in connection with the sale of excess corporate property. The income in 2021 includes $3 million of expense relating to the Sch\u00fclke acquisition and a $14 million gain related to the sale of a Specialty Additives facility.\nInventory adjustments - During 2021, Ashland recorded non-cash charges related to the fair value adjustment of inventory acquired from Sch\u00fclke at the date of acquisition during 2021.\nAsset impairments - Ashland recognized impairment charges to certain assets during 2023 and 2021. See Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nICMS Brazil tax credit - In 2017, the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil ruled in a leading case that a Brazil value-added tax (ICMS) should not be included in the base used to calculate a taxpayer's federal contribution on total revenue known as PIS/COFINS (2017 Decision). Following favorable court rulings from lawsuits previously filed by two of Ashland's\nM-12\nBrazilian subsidiaries challenging the inclusion of ICMS in Ashland's calculation of PIS/COFINS, Ashland received acknowledgment from the Brazilian tax authorities that allows Ashland to begin the process to recover the taxes. See Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nNon-operating key items affecting EBITDA\nDuring the current and prior years, there were certain key items that were not included in operating income but were excluded to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA. These non-operating key items for the applicable periods are summarized as follows:\nGain/loss on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements - Ashland recognized actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year. See Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\n(In millions)\nNet income\n$\n$\n$\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n(8\n)\n(38\n)\nNet interest and other financing expense\nDepreciation and amortization\nEBITDA\n1,342\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\n(10\n)\n(746\n)\n(47\n)\nKey items included in EBITDA:\nRestructuring, separation and other costs\nEnvironmental reserve adjustments\nIncome on acquisitions and divestitures, net\n(6\n)\n(42\n)\n(11\n)\nInventory adjustments\n-\n-\nAsset impairments\n-\nICMS Brazil tax credit\n(12\n)\n-\n-\nLoss (gain) on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements\n(2\n)\n(22\n)\nTotal key items included in EBITDA\n(6\n)\nAdjusted EBITDA (a)\n$\n$\n$\nTotal key items included in EBITDA\n$\n$\n(6\n)\n$\nAccelerated amortization of debt issuance costs\n-\n-\nDebt refinancing costs (b)\n-\n-\nUnrealized (gain) loss on securities\n(29\n)\n(21\n)\nTotal key items, before tax\n$\n$\n$\n(a)Includes $12 million, $7 million and $6 million during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of net periodic pension and other postretirement expense recognized ratably through the fiscal year. These expenses are comprised of service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of prior service credit and are disclosed in further detail in Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(b)Debt refinancing costs during 2021 included a $16 million loss on early retirement of debt and a $1 million charge for accelerated debt issuance costs. All debt refinancing costs were recorded within the net interest and other financing expense caption on the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). See Note H of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nM-13\nDiluted EPS and Adjusted Diluted EPS\nThe following table reflects the U.S. GAAP calculation for the income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for the cumulative diluted EPS effect for key items after tax that have been identified in the Adjusted EBITDA table in the previous section. Key items are defined as the financial effects from significant transactions that may have caused short-term fluctuations in net income and/or operating income which Ashland believes do not accurately reflect Ashlands underlying business performance and trends. The Adjusted Diluted EPS for the income (loss) from continuing operations and Adjusted Diluted EPS from continuing operations excluding intangibles amortization expense in the following table have been prepared to illustrate these ongoing effects on Ashlands operations. Management believes investors and analysts use this financial measure in assessing Ashland's business performance and that presenting this non-GAAP measure on a consolidated basis assists investors in better understanding Ashlands ongoing business performance and enhancing their ability to compare period-to-period financial results.\nDiluted EPS from continuing operations (as reported)\n$\n3.13\n$\n3.20\n$\n2.82\nKey items, before tax:\nRestructuring, separation and other costs (including accelerated depreciation)\n0.19\n0.09\n0.16\nEnvironmental reserve adjustments\n1.04\n0.95\n0.70\nIncome on acquisitions and divestitures, net\n(0.11\n)\n(0.75\n)\n(0.18\n)\nInventory adjustments\n-\n-\n0.07\nAsset impairments\n0.08\n-\n0.21\nICMS Brazil tax credit\n(0.22\n)\n-\n-\nLoss (gain) on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements\n(0.04\n)\n(0.40\n)\n0.02\nUnrealized (gain) loss on securities\n(0.54\n)\n1.82\n(0.34\n)\nAccelerated amortization of debt issuance costs\n-\n-\n0.02\nDebt refinancing costs\n-\n-\n0.26\nKey items, before tax\n0.40\n1.71\n0.92\nTax effect of key items (a)\n(0.02\n)\n(0.38\n)\n(0.18\n)\nKey items, after tax\n0.38\n1.33\n0.74\nTax specific key items:\nUncertain tax positions\n(0.60\n)\n(0.15\n)\n(0.87\n)\nRestructuring and separation activity\n-\n0.06\n(0.21\n)\nValuation allowance\n(0.12\n)\n(0.07\n)\n-\nOther tax reform related activity\n(0.11\n)\n-\n0.10\nTax specific key items (b)\n(0.83\n)\n(0.16\n)\n(0.98\n)\nTotal key items\n(0.45\n)\n1.17\n(0.24\n)\nAdjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (non-GAAP)\n$\n2.68\n$\n4.37\n$\n2.58\nAmortization expense adjustment (net of tax) (c)\n1.39\n1.33\n1.17\nAdjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (non-GAAP)\nexcluding intangibles amortization expense\n$\n4.07\n$\n5.70\n$\n3.75\n(a)Represents the diluted EPS impact from the tax effect of the key items that are previously identified above.\n(b)Represents the diluted EPS impact from tax specific financial transactions, tax law changes or other matters that fall within the definition of tax specific key items.

Unallocated and Other includes corporate governance activities and certain legacy matters.\nResults of Ashlands reportable segments are presented based on its management and internal accounting structure. The structure is specific to Ashland; therefore, the financial results of Ashlands reportable segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other companies. Ashland allocates all significant costs to its reportable segments except for certain significant company-wide restructuring activities, certain corporate governance costs and other costs or activities that relate to former businesses that Ashland no longer operates. The service cost component of pension and other postretirement benefits costs is allocated to each reportable segment on a ratable basis; while the remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits costs are recorded within the other net periodic benefit loss (income) caption on the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). Ashland refines its expense allocation methodologies to the reportable segments from time to time as internal accounting practices are improved, more refined information becomes available and the industry or market changes. Significant revisions to Ashlands methodologies are adjusted for all segments on a retrospective basis. This includes charges in prior years for indirect corporate costs previously allocated to Performance Adhesives. These costs are reflected in Unallocated and Other for all periods presented.\nM-15\nThe following table shows sales, operating income, depreciation and amortization and EBITDA by reportable segment for each of the last three years ended September 30.\n(In millions)\nchange\nchange\nSales\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nPersonal Care\n(80\n)\nSpecialty Additives\n(119\n)\nIntermediates\n(71\n)\nIntersegment sales (a)\n(61\n)\n(77\n)\n(51\n)\n(26\n)\n$\n2,191\n$\n2,391\n$\n2,111\n$\n(200\n)\n$\nOperating income (loss)\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nPersonal Care (b)\n(50\n)\nSpecialty Additives (b)\n(93\n)\nIntermediates\n(37\n)\nUnallocated and Other (b)\n(112\n)\n(114\n)\n(107\n)\n(7\n)\n$\n$\n$\n$\n(161\n)\n$\nDepreciation expense\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n(1\n)\nPersonal Care\n(2\n)\nSpecialty Additives\n(5\n)\n(3\n)\nIntermediates\n-\nUnallocated and Other\n-\n-\n-\n(1\n)\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n(7\n)\nAmortization expense\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\nPersonal Care\n-\nSpecialty Additives\n-\n(1\n)\nIntermediates\n-\n(1\n)\n-\nUnallocated and Other\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n$\n$\n$\n$\n(1\n)\n$\nEBITDA (c)\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nPersonal Care\n(49\n)\nSpecialty Additives\n(98\n)\nIntermediates\n(37\n)\nUnallocated and Other\n(112\n)\n(114\n)\n(106\n)\n(8\n)\n$\n$\n$\n$\n(159\n)\n$\n(a)Intersegment sales from Intermediates are accounted for at prices that approximate fair value.

Each of these non-GAAP measures is defined as follows: EBITDA (operating income plus depreciation and amortization), Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA adjusted for key items as applicable), and Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by sales). Ashland does not allocate items to each reportable segment below operating income, such as interest expense and income taxes. As a result, reportable segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are reconciled directly to operating income since it is the most directly comparable Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) caption.\nThe following EBITDA presentation for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, is provided as a means to enhance the understanding of financial measurements that Ashland has internally determined to be relevant measures of comparison for the results of Life Sciences. The key items during the year ended September 30, 2023 related to charges of $4 million for restructuring actions and $2 million for environmental reserve adjustments. The key items during the year ended September 30, 2021 related to environmental reserve adjustments of $1 million.\nM-17\n(In millions)\nchange\nchange\nOperating income\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nDepreciation and amortization\n(1\n)\nEBITDA\nRestructuring and other costs\n-\n-\n-\nEnvironmental reserve adjustments\n-\n(1\n)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nAs a percent of sales\n28.4\n%\n26.7\n%\n26.5\n%\n170 bps\n20 bps\n2023 compared to 2022\nLife Sciences' sales, operating income and Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2023 due to favorable price/mix actions, partially offset by higher costs associated with inflation, lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency exchange.

In certain circumstances, if such amounts were repatriated to the United States, additional withholding taxes might need to be accrued and paid depending on the source of the earnings remitted. Ashland currently has no plans to repatriate any amounts for which additional taxes would need to be accrued.\nAshland has taken actions and may continue to take actions intended to increase its cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of current uncertainty in global markets. At September 30, 2023, Ashland has total remaining borrowing capacity of $698 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility and foreign Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility. Ashland had no available liquidity under the U.S. Accounts Receivable Sales Program as of September 30, 2023. Ashland has no maturities related to revolving credit facilities or bonds until fiscal 2027. On October 19, 2023, Ashland established a new three-year \u20ac125 million foreign accounts receivable sales program in Europe which will enhance Ashland's liquidity profile. See Notes H and R for more information.\nAshland believes that cash flow from operations, availability under existing credit facilities and arrangements, current cash and investment balances and the ability to obtain other financing, if necessary, will provide adequate cash funds for Ashlands foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures at existing facilities, dividend payments and debt service obligations. Ashlands cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that the Company may complete may also impact its cash requirements.\nAshlands cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows, are summarized as follows.\n(In millions)\nCash provided (used) by:\nOperating activities from continuing operations\n$\n$\n$\nInvesting activities from continuing operations\n(109\n)\n(102\n)\n(367\n)\nFinancing activities from continuing operations\n(371\n)\n(896\n)\n(426\n)\nDiscontinued operations\n(51\n)\n1,252\nEffect of currency exchange rate changes on cash and\ncash equivalents\n(11\n)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n(229\n)\n$\n$\n(244\n)\nAshland paid income taxes of $63 million (of which $16 million related to discontinued operations) during 2023 compared to $406 million in 2022 (of which $339 million related to discontinued operations) and $1 million in 2021. Cash receipts for interest income were $12 million in 2023, $4 million in 2022, and $1 million 2021, respectively, while cash payments for interest expense amounted to $53 million in 2023, $56 million in 2022 and $62 million in 2021.\nM-23\nOperating activities\nThe following discloses the cash flows associated with Ashlands operating activities for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(In millions)\nCash flows provided (used) by operating activities from\ncontinuing operations\nNet income\n$\n$\n$\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\n(10\n)\n(746\n)\n(47\n)\nAdjustments to reconcile income from continuing operations to\ncash flows from operating activities\nDepreciation and amortization\nOriginal issue discount and debt issuance cost amortization\nDeferred income taxes\n(32\n)\n(35\n)\n(26\n)\nDistributions from equity affiliates\n-\n-\nGain from sales of property and equipment\n(1\n)\n-\n(4\n)\nStock based compensation expense - Note O\nExcess tax benefits on stock based compensation\nLoss on early retirement of debt\n-\n-\nLoss (income) from restricted investments\n(43\n)\n(33\n)\nIncome on acquisitions and divestitures, net - Notes B\n(7\n)\n(42\n)\n(15\n)\nAsset impairments\n-\nPension contributions\n(8\n)\n(5\n)\n(8\n)\nLoss (gain) on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements\n(2\n)\n(22\n)\nChange in operating assets and liabilities (a)\n(58\n)\n(237\n)\nTotal cash flows provided by operating activities from\ncontinuing operations\n$\n$\n$\n(a)Excludes changes resulting from operations acquired or sold.\nCash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations, a major source of Ashlands liquidity, amounted to $294 million in 2023, $193 million in 2022 and $466 million in 2021.\nOperating Activities - Operating Assets and Liabilities\nThe cash results during each year were primarily driven by net income, excluding discontinued operation results, adjusted for certain non-cash items including depreciation and amortization (including debt issuance cost amortization), income on acquisitions and divestitures, net as well as changes in working capital, which are fluctuations within accounts receivable, inventory, trade payables and accrued expenses.\nThe following details certain changes in key operating assets and liabilities for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(In millions)\nCash flows from assets and liabilities (a)\nAccounts receivable\n$\n$\n(23\n)\n$\nInventories\n(7\n)\n(141\n)\nTrade and other payables\n(112\n)\nOther assets and liabilities\n(107\n)\n(36\n)\nChange in operating assets and liabilities\n$\n(58\n)\n$\n(237\n)\n$\n(a)Excludes changes resulting from operations acquired or sold.\nM-24\nChanges in net working capital accounted for outflows of $61 million in 2023, outflows of $130 million in 2022 and inflows of $116 million in 2021, and were driven by the following:\nAccounts receivable - Changes in accounts receivable resulted in inflows of $58 million, outflows of $23 million, and inflows of $72 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The U.S. Accounts Receivable Sales Program contributed to outflows of $40 million, and inflows of $17 million and $92 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales volumes in each period and activity from the U.S. Accounts Receivable Sales Program were the main drivers of changes between periods.\nInventory - Changes in inventory resulted in cash outflows of $7 million in 2023, outflows of $141 million in 2022 and inflows of $41 million in 2021 and were primarily driven by inventory production levels and volumes. Additionally, 2022 was impacted by cost inflation and management efforts to rebuild inventory levels globally in response to global supply-chain challenges.\nTrade and other payables - Changes in trade and other payables resulted in cash outflows of $112 million in 2023, and cash inflows of $34 million in 2022 and $3 million in 2021, respectively, and primarily related to the timing of certain payments, most notably incentive plan payments in 2023 for fiscal year 2022.\nThe remaining cash inflow of $3 million, and outflows of $107 million and $36 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were primarily due to income taxes paid or income tax refunds, interest paid, and adjustments to certain accruals and other long-term assets and liabilities such as payments associated with environmental remediation.\nOperating Activities - Other\nOperating cash flows for 2023 included income from continuing operations of $168 million and significant non-cash adjustments of $243 million for depreciation and amortization, $22 million for stock-based compensation expense, $43 million of gains from restricted investments, $2 million gain on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements, $32 million for deferred taxes, and $7 million of income on acquisitions and divestitures, net.\nOperating cash flows for 2022 included income from continuing operations of $181 million and significant non-cash adjustments of $241 million for depreciation and amortization, $18 million for stock-based compensation expense, $86 million of losses from restricted investments, a $22 million gain on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements, $35 million for deferred taxes, and $42 million of income on acquisitions and divestitures, net.\nOperating cash flows for 2021 included income from continuing operations of $173 million and significant non-cash adjustments of $244 million for depreciation and amortization, $15 million for stock-based compensation expense, $16 million for losses on early retirement of debt, $33 million of income from restricted investments, $26 million for deferred taxes, $15 million of income on acquisitions and divestitures, net and $13 million for impairment charges.\nM-25\nInvesting activities\nThe following discloses the cash flows associated with Ashlands investing activities for 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n(In millions)\nCash flows provided (used) by investing activities from\ncontinuing operations\nAdditions to property, plant and equipment\n$\n(170\n)\n$\n(113\n)\n$\n(105\n)\nProceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment\nPurchase of operations - net of cash acquired\n-\n-\n(309\n)\nProceeds from sale or restructuring of operations\n-\n-\nProceeds from settlement of company-owned life insurance contracts\nCompany-owned life insurance payments\n(5\n)\n(4\n)\n(6\n)\nFunds restricted for specific transactions\n(9\n)\n(74\n)\n(91\n)\nReimbursement from restricted investments\nProceeds from sale of securities\nPurchase of securities\n(47\n)\n(87\n)\n(149\n)\nProceeds from the settlement of derivative instruments\n-\n-\nTotal cash flows used by investing activities from continuing operations\n$\n(109\n)\n$\n(102\n)\n$\n(367\n)\nCash used by investing activities was $109 million in 2023 compared to $102 million and $367 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The $165 million decrease in working capital was driven by a reduction in cash and cash equivalents, primarily associated with repurchases of common stock, offset by higher trade working capital (accounts receivable and inventories minus trade and other payables and accrued expenses and other liabilities). The $90 million increase in ongoing free cash flows between periods was primarily a result of reduced trade working capital additions compared to the prior year offset by $57 million in higher additions to property, plant and equipment. Liquid assets (cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable) amounted to 166% and 190% of current liabilities (excluding current liabilities held for sale) as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively.\nThe following summary reflects Ashlands cash, investment securities and unused borrowing capacity as of September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nSeptember 30\n(In millions)\nCash and investment securities\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n$\n$\nRestricted investments (a)\nUnused borrowing capacity\nRevolving credit facility\n$\n$\n$\n2018 accounts receivable securitization (foreign)\n-\nAccounts receivable sales program (U.S.)\n-\n-\n(a)Includes $243 million, $245 million and $333 million related to the Asbestos trust and $124 million, $129 million and $88 million related to the Environmental trust as of September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 respectively.\nThe borrowing capacity remaining under the $600 million revolving credit facility was $594 million due to a reduction of $6 million for letters of credit outstanding at September 30, 2023. In total, Ashlands available liquidity position, which includes cash, the revolving credit facilities, and accounts receivable securitization facilities, was $1,115 million at September 30, 2023 as compared to $1,326 million at September 30, 2022 and $566 million at September 30, 2021. Ashland had zero liquidity available under the U.S. Accounts Receivable Sales Program as of September 30, 2023 and 2022. Ashland also maintained $367 million of restricted investments to pay for future asbestos claims and environmental remediation and litigation.

Proceeds of borrowings under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility provide ongoing working capital and are used for other general corporate purposes.\nDebt as a percent of capital employed was 30% at September 30, 2023 and 28% at September 30, 2022. At September 30, 2023, Ashlands total debt had an outstanding principal balance of $1,376 million, discounts of $33 million and debt issuance costs of $13 million. Ashland had no long-term debt (excluding debt issuance costs) maturing within the next 3 years, $4 million due in fiscal 2027 and $528 million due in fiscal 2028.\nM-28\nCredit Agreements and Refinancing\nNote Issuances\nDuring August 2021, Ashland, through one of its subsidiaries, completed the issuance of 3.375% senior unsecured notes due 2031 with an aggregate principal amount of $450 million (the 2031 Notes). The notes are guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Ashland. Ashland used the net proceeds of the offering (after deducting initial purchasers' discounts and other fees and expenses) to redeem its obligations under the existing 4.750% senior notes due 2022 described below in debt repayments, and to pay fees and expenses associated therewith.\nAshland incurred $6 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the 2031 Notes, which is amortized using the effective interest method over the 2031 Notes' term and was included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) during 2021.\n2020 Credit Agreement\nDuring July 2022, Ashland, through two of its subsidiaries, enacted an amendment to the 2020 credit agreement. The amended credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement) provides for a $600 million five-year revolving credit facility (the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility). The 2022 Credit Agreement and the obligations of Ashland Services B.V. under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by Ashland.\nAt Ashlands option, loans issued under the 2022 Credit Agreement will bear interest at (a) in the case of loans denominated in U.S. dollars, either Term SOFR or an alternate base rate and (b) in the case of loans denominated in Euros, EURIBOR, in each case plus the applicable interest rate margin. Loans will initially bear interest at Term SOFR or EURIBOR plus 1.250% per annum, in the case of Term SOFR borrowings or EURIBOR borrowings, respectively, or at the alternate base rate plus 0.250% per annum, in the case of alternate base rate borrowings, through and including the date of delivery of a quarterly compliance certificate and thereafter the interest rate will fluctuate between Term SOFR or EURIBOR plus 1.250% per annum and Term SOFR or EURIBOR plus 1.750% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 0.250% per annum and the alternate base rate plus 0.750% per annum), based upon the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) at such time. Term SOFR borrowings are subject to a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% per annum. In addition, the Company will initially be required to pay fees of 0.125% per annum on the daily unused amount of the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility through and including the date of delivery of a quarterly compliance certificate, and thereafter the fee rate will fluctuate between 0.125% and 0.275% per annum, based upon the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio. Borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement may be prepaid at any time without premiums.\nAs a result of the amendment of the 2020 Credit Agreement, Ashland recognized a $1 million charge for accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2022, which is included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). Ashland also incurred $2 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the 2022 Credit Agreement, of which $1 million was expensed immediately during 2022 within the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). The remaining balance is amortized using the straight-line method.\nThe 2022 Credit Agreement contains financial covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios akin to those in effect under the 2020 Credit Agreement. The 2022 Credit Agreement contains usual and customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios, limitations on liens, additional indebtedness, further negative pledges, investments, mergers, sale of assets and restricted payments, and other customary limitations.\nDebt repayments and repurchases\nCash repatriation\nDuring 2023 and 2022, Ashland repatriated approximately $92 million and $250 million, respectively, in cash. In 2022 the repatriation was primarily used to repay existing debt, principally the repayment of the Term loan A.\n2022 Debt repayments and repurchases\nM-29\n2020 Credit Agreement\nDuring 2022, Ashland prepaid its Term loan A principal balance of $250 million.\nOther Debt\nDuring 2022, Ashland repaid the outstanding balance on its European short-term loan facility for $23 million.\n2021 Debt repayments and repurchases\nRedemption of 4.750% senior notes due 2022\nDuring 2021, Ashland redeemed all of its outstanding 4.750% senior notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes), of which approximately $411 million were outstanding. Ashland recognized a $1 million charge related to accelerated accretion on debt discounts and accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs, which is included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nTotal premiums paid for all the tender offers in 2021 noted above were $16 million, which is included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nAccounts receivable facilities and off-balance sheet arrangements\nU.S. accounts receivable sales program\nOn March 17, 2021, a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity and consolidated Ashland subsidiary (SPE) entered into an agreement with a group of entities (buyers) to sell certain trade receivables, without recourse beyond the pledged receivables, of two other U.S. based Ashland subsidiaries. Under the agreement, Ashland can transfer whole receivables up to a limit established by the buyer, which is currently set at $125 million between February and October of each year and up to $100 million all other times. Ashlands continuing involvement is limited to servicing the receivables, including billing, collections and remittance of payments to the buyers as well as a limited guarantee on over-collateralization. The arrangement was set to terminate on May 31, 2023.\nOn April 14, 2023, Ashland entered into Second and Third Amendments associated with this current program. As part of these amendments the buyer's limit was reduced to $115 million between April and October of each year, and up to $100 million at all other times. Additionally, the scheduled termination date was extended from May 31, 2023 to April 14, 2025.\nAshland determined that any receivables transferred under this agreement are put presumptively beyond the reach of Ashland and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. Ashland received a true sale at law and non-consolidation opinions to support the legal isolation of these receivables. Ashland accounts for the receivables transferred to buyers as sales. Ashland recognizes any gains or losses based on the excess of proceeds received net of buyers discounts and fees compared to the carrying value of the assets. Proceeds received, net of buyers discounts and fees, are recorded within the operating activities of the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. Losses on sale of assets, including related transaction expenses are recorded within the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). Ashland regularly assesses its servicing obligations and records them as assets or liabilities when appropriate. Ashland also monitors its obligation with regards to the limited guarantee and records the resulting guarantee liability when warranted. When applicable, Ashland discloses the amount of the receivable that serves as over-collateralization as a restricted asset.\nAshland recognized a $3 million and a $1 million loss within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for 2023 and 2022, respectively, within the net interest and other expense caption associated with sales under the program. Ashland has recorded $86 million of sales against the buyers limit, which was $115 million at September 30, 2023, compared to $110 million of sales against the buyer's limit, which was $125 million at September 30, 2022. Ashland transferred $106 million and $136 million in receivables to the SPE as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Ashland recorded liabilities related to its service obligations and limited guarantee as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 of less than $1 million. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the year-to-date gross cash proceeds received for receivables transferred and derecognized were $217 million and $312 million, respectively, of which $241 million and $315 million were collected by Ashland in our capacity as a servicer of the receivables and remitted to the buyer. The difference between receivables transferred and derecognized versus\nM-30\ncollected of $24 million and $3 million for the periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, represents the impact of a net reduction in account receivable sales volume during each year. The prior year period included the impact of a $21 million net reduction in accounts receivables sales volume attributable to the Adhesives business sold in 2022.\n2018 foreign accounts receivable securitization\nDuring July 2018, Ashland entered into a \u20ac115 million accounts receivable securitization facility (the Program) for the transfer by certain subsidiaries of Ashland (the Sellers) directly or indirectly to Ester Finance Titrisation (the Purchaser), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (the Arranger), of certain receivables and/or collections originated by the Sellers towards certain corporate debtors located in multiple European jurisdictions and denominated in multiple currencies. The Program originally had a term of two years, but was extended to August 2021 in September 2019. During July 2021, the termination date of the Program was extended to July 2023. During July 2020, the available funding for qualified receivables under the accounts receivable securitization facility decreased from \u20ac115 million to \u20ac100 million. During July 2023, the program was extended to September 30, 2023.\nUnder the Program, each Seller assigns, on an ongoing basis, certain of its accounts receivable and the right to the collections on those accounts receivable to the Purchaser. Under the terms of the Program, the Sellers could, from time to time, obtain up to \u20ac100 million from the Purchaser through the sale of an undivided interest in such accounts receivable and collections. Ashland accounts for the securitization facility as secured borrowings, and the receivables sold pursuant to the facility are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts receivable. Fundings under the Program will be repaid as accounts receivable are collected, with new fundings being advanced (through daily advanced purchase price) as new accounts receivable are originated by the Sellers and assigned to the Purchaser, with settlement occurring monthly. Ashland classifies any borrowings under this facility as a short-term debt instrument within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Once sold to the Purchaser, the accounts receivable and rights to collection described above are separate and distinct from each Sellers own assets and are not available to its creditors should such Sellers become insolvent.\nAt September 30, 2023 and 2022 the outstanding amount of accounts receivable transferred by Ashland to the Purchaser was $124 million and $162 million, respectively, and there were no borrowings (denominated in multiple currencies) under the facility for either period. The weighted-average interest rate for this instrument was 0.5% for 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOther debt\nAt September 30, 2023 and 2022, Ashland held other debt totaling $83 million and $63 million, respectively, comprised primarily of the 6.50% notes due 2029 and other notes.\nAvailable borrowing capacity and liquidity\nThe borrowing capacity remaining under the $600 million 2022 Revolving Credit Facility was $594 million due to a reduction of $6 million for letters of credit outstanding at September 30, 2023. Ashland's total borrowing capacity at September 30, 2023 was $698 million, which included $104 million of available capacity from the foreign 2018 Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility.\nAdditionally, Ashland has no available liquidity under its current U.S. Accounts Receivable Sales Program.\nCovenants related to current Ashland debt agreements\nAshlands debt contains usual and customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios, limitations on liens, additional subsidiary indebtedness, restrictions on subsidiary distributions, investments, mergers, sale of assets and restricted payments and other customary limitations. As of September 30, 2023, Ashland was in compliance with all debt agreement covenant restrictions.\nThe maximum consolidated net leverage ratio permitted under the 2022 Credit Agreement is 4.0. The 2022 Credit Agreement defines the consolidated net leverage ratio as the ratio of consolidated indebtedness minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to consolidated EBITDA (Covenant Adjusted EBITDA) for any measurement period. In general, the 2022 Credit Agreement defines Covenant Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus consolidated interest charges, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, fees and expenses related to capital market transactions and proposed or actual acquisitions and divestitures,\nM-31\nrestructuring and integration charges, certain environmental charges, non-cash stock and equity compensation expense, and any other nonrecurring expenses or losses that do not represent a cash item in such period or any future period; less any non-cash gains or other items increasing net income. The computation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA differs from the calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which have been reconciled in the \"Use of non-GAAP measures\" section. In general, consolidated indebtedness includes debt plus all purchase money indebtedness, bankers acceptances and bank guaranties, deferred purchase price of property or services, attributable indebtedness and guarantees. At September 30, 2023, Ashlands calculation of the consolidated net leverage ratio was 1.9.\nThe minimum required consolidated interest coverage ratio under the 2022 Credit Agreement is 3.0. The 2022 Credit Agreement defines the consolidated interest coverage ratio as the ratio of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest charges for any measurement period. At September 30, 2023, Ashlands calculation of the consolidated interest coverage ratio was 8.6.\nAny change in Covenant Adjusted EBITDA of $100 million would have an approximate 0.3x effect on the consolidated net leverage ratio and a 1.8x effect on the consolidated interest coverage ratio. Any change in consolidated indebtedness of $100 million would affect the consolidated net leverage ratio by approximately 0.2x.\nAshland credit ratings\nAshlands corporate credit ratings remained unchanged at BB+ by Standard & Poors and Ba1 by Moodys Investor Services. As of September 30, 2023, both Moodys Investor Services and Standard & Poors outlook remained at stable. Subsequent changes to these ratings or outlook may have an effect on Ashlands borrowing rate or ability to access capital markets in the future.\nAdditional capital resources\nAshland cash projection\nAshland believes that cash flow from operations, availability under existing credit facilities and arrangements, current cash and investment balances and the ability to obtain other financing, if necessary, will provide adequate cash funds for the Companys foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures at existing facilities, pending acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations. The Companys cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that the Company may complete may also impact its cash requirements.\nM-32\nAshland expects the following material cash funding requirements from known contractual obligations at September 30, 2023:\nLess than\nMore than\n(In millions)\nTotal\n1 year\n1 year\nMaterial Cash Funding Requirements Contractual obligations\nRaw material and service contract purchase obligations (a)\n$\n$\n$\nEmployee benefit obligations (b)\nOperating lease obligations (c)\nInterest payments (d)\nUnrecognized tax benefits (e)\nOne-time transition tax (f)\nTotal contractual obligations\n$\n1,181\n$\n$\n1,027\nOther commitments\nLetters of credit (g)\n$\n$\n$\n-\n(a)Includes raw material and service contracts where minimal committed quantities and prices are fixed.\n(b)Includes estimated funding of Ashlands qualified U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans for 2023 as well as projected benefit payments through 2030 under Ashlands unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Excludes the benefit payments from the pension plan trust funds. See Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n(c)Includes leases for office buildings, transportation equipment, warehouses and storage facilities and other equipment. For further information, see Note J of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(d)Includes interest expense on both variable and fixed rate debt assuming no prepayments. Variable interest rates have been assumed to remain constant through the end of the term at rates that existed as of September 30, 2023.\n(e)Due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with respect to taxing authorities, Ashland is unable to determine the timing of payments related to noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties. Therefore, these amounts were included in the More than 1 year column.\n(f)As a result of the Tax Act enacted during fiscal year 2017, Ashland has currently recorded a $39 million liability for the one-time transition tax. This liability will be payable over five years.\n(g)Ashland issues various types of letters of credit as part of its normal course of business.\nTotal Equity\nTotal equity was $3,097 million and $3,220 million at September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. During 2023, there were increases of $178 million for net income, $72 million for deferred translation gains, and $12 million for common shares issued under stock incentive plans. The increases were more than offset by decreases of $6 million for unrealized losses on commodity hedges, $76 million for dividends paid during 2023, and $303 million for repurchases of common stock (which includes $3 million in excise tax on stock repurchases).\n2023 Stock repurchase program\nOn June 28, 2023, Ashland's board of directors authorized a new evergreen $1 billion common share repurchase program (2023 stock repurchase program). The new authorization terminates and replaces the company's 2022 stock repurchase program, which had $200 million outstanding at the date of termination. As of September 30, 2023, $1 billion remained available for repurchase under the 2023 stock repurchase program.\n2022 Stock repurchase program\nOn May 25, 2022, Ashland's board of directors authorized a new, evergreen $500 million common share repurchase program (2022 stock repurchase program). The new authorization terminates and replaces the company's 2018 $1 billion share repurchase program, which had $150 million outstanding at the date of termination. As of September 30, 2022, $500 million remained available for repurchase under the 2022 stock repurchase program.\nStock repurchase program agreements\nDuring May 2023, under the 2022 stock repurchase program, Ashland initiated a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan agreement to repurchase up to $100 million of its outstanding shares. The program was completed during June 2023, when Ashland paid a total of $100 million and received a delivery of 1.1 million shares of common stock.\nM-33\nDuring March 2023, under the 2022 stock repurchase program, Ashland initiated a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan agreement to repurchase up to $100 million of its outstanding shares. The program was completed during April 2023, when Ashland paid a total of $100 million and received a delivery of 1.0 million shares of common stock.\nDuring February 2023, under the 2022 stock repurchase program, Ashland initiated a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan agreement to repurchase up to $100 million of its outstanding shares. The program was completed during February 2023, when Ashland paid a total of $100 million and received a delivery of 1.0 million shares of common stock.\nOn March 1, 2022, under the 2018 stock repurchase program, Ashland entered into an agreement to repurchase an aggregate amount of $200 million of Ashland common stock using open-market purchases under rule 10b-18. On April 8, 2022, Ashland completed repurchases under this agreement repurchasing a total of 2.15 million shares for a total amount of $200 million.\nIn September 2021, under the 2018 stock repurchase program, Ashland announced that it entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (2021 ASR Agreement). Under the 2021 ASR Agreement, Ashland paid an initial purchase price of $450 million and received an initial delivery of 3.9 million shares of common stock during September 2021. The bank exercised its early termination option under the 2021 ASR Agreement in February 2022, and an additional 0.7 million shares were repurchased, bringing the total shares repurchased upon settlement to 4.6 million.\nStockholder dividends\nAshland paid dividends per common share of $1.44, $1.27 and $1.15 during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIn May 2023, the Board of Directors of Ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend of 38.5 cents per share to eligible stockholders at record, which represented an increase from the previous quarterly cash dividend of 33.5 cents per share. The dividend was paid in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\nIn May 2022, the Board of Directors of Ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend of 33.5 cents per share to eligible stockholders at record, which represented an increase from the previous quarterly cash dividend of 30.0 cents per share. This dividend was paid in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022 and the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023.\nIn May 2021, the Board of Directors of Ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend of 30.0 cents per share to eligible stockholders at record, which represented an increase from the previous quarterly cash dividend of 27.5 cents per share. This dividend was paid in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021 and the first and second quarters of fiscal 2022.\nIn May 2019, the Board of Directors of Ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend of 27.5 cents per share to eligible stockholders at record, which represented an increase from the previous quarterly cash dividend of 25.0 cents per share. This dividend was paid in first and second quarters of fiscal 2021.\nCapital expenditures\nCapital expenditures were $170 million for 2023 and averaged $129 million during the last three years. Ashland expects capital expenditures over the next three years to average approximately $165 million per year. A summary of capital expenditures by reportable segment during 2023, 2022 and 2021 follow.\n(In millions)\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\n$\nPersonal Care\nSpecialty Additives\nIntermediates\nUnallocated and Other\nTotal capital expenditures\n$\n$\n$\nM-34\nA summary of the capital employed in Ashlands current operations, which is calculated by adding equity to capital investment, as of the end of the last two years is as follows.\n(In millions)\nCapital employed (a)\nLife Sciences\n$\n1,807\n$\n1,801\nPersonal Care\nSpecialty Additives\n1,421\n1,379\nIntermediates\n(a)Excludes the assets and liabilities classified within unallocated and other which primarily includes debt and other long-term liabilities such as asbestos and pension. The net liability in unallocated and other was $1,190 million and $1,092 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs part of its normal course of business, Ashland is a party to various financial guarantees and other commitments. These arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk that are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility that Ashland would have to make actual cash expenditures in connection with these obligations is largely dependent on the performance of the guaranteed party, or the occurrence of future events that Ashland is unable to predict. The fair value of these guarantees is not significant.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor a discussion and analysis of recently issued accounting pronouncements and its impact on Ashland, see Note A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of Ashlands Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, environmental remediation, asbestos litigation, the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management has reviewed the estimates affecting these items with the Audit Committee of Ashlands Board of Directors.\nEnvironmental remediation and asset retirement obligations\nAshland is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts (collectively environmental remediation) at multiple locations. At September 30, 2023, such locations included 57 sites where Ashland has been identified as a potentially responsible party under Superfund or similar state laws, 108 current and former operating facilities and about 1,225 service station properties, of which 14 are being actively remediated. See Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAshlands reserves for environmental remediation and related environmental litigation amounted to $214 million at September 30, 2023 compared to $211 million at September 30, 2022 of which $165 million at September 30, 2023 and $157 million at September 30, 2022 were classified in other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining reserves were classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe total reserves for environmental remediation reflect Ashlands estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable, without regard to any third-party recoveries. Engineering studies, historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation. Ashland regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues.\nM-35\nDuring 2023, 2022 and 2021, Ashland recognized $56 million, $66 million and $50 million of expense, respectively, for certain environmental liabilities related to normal ongoing remediation cost estimate updates for sites, which is consistent with Ashlands historical environmental accounting policy.\nEnvironmental remediation reserves are subject to uncertainties that affect Ashlands ability to estimate its share of the costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site and the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, with varying costs of alternate cleanup methods. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of environmental remediation, Ashland currently estimates that the upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for identified sites could be as high as approximately $465 million. The largest reserve for any site is 21% of the remediation reserve.\nAsbestos litigation\nAshland and Hercules have liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. To assist in developing and annually updating independent reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs, Ashland has retained third party actuarial experts Gnarus Advisors, LLC (Gnarus). The methodology used by Gnarus to project future asbestos costs is based largely on recent experience, including claim-filing and settlement rates, disease mix, open claims and litigation defense. The claim experience of Ashland and Hercules are separately compared to the results of previously conducted third party epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases. Those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population expected to have been exposed to asbestos. Using that information, Gnarus estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed, as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims. Changes in asbestos-related liabilities and receivables are recorded on an after-tax basis within the discontinued operations caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). See Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAshland asbestos-related litigation\nThe claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos asserted against Ashland result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in 1990 in connection with the sale of Riley, a former subsidiary. The amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate from period to period.\nAshland asbestos-related liability\nFrom the range of estimates, Ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs. Ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non-inflated, non-discounted approximate 40-year model developed with the assistance of Gnarus.\nDuring the most recent update completed during 2023, it was determined that the liability for Ashland asbestos-related claims should be increased by $9 million. Total reserves for asbestos claims were $281 million at September 30, 2023 compared to $305 million at September 30, 2022.\nAshland asbestos-related receivables\nAshland has insurance coverage for certain litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in connection with its asbestos claims, and coverage-in-place agreements exist with the insurance companies that provide substantially all of the coverage that will be accessed.\nFor the Ashland asbestos-related obligations, Ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on managements interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage, including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent. Substantially all of the estimated receivables from insurance companies are expected to be due from domestic insurers, all of which are solvent.\nAt September 30, 2023, Ashlands receivable for recoveries of litigation defense and claim settlement costs from insurers amounted to $95 million (excluding the Hercules receivable for asbestos claims). Receivables from insurers amounted to $101 million at September 30, 2022. During 2023, the annual update of the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve\nM-36\nand its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers, was completed. This model update resulted in a $3 million increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries.\nHercules asbestos-related litigation\nHercules has liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Such claims typically arise from alleged exposure to asbestos fibers from resin encapsulated pipe and tank products which were sold by one of Hercules former subsidiaries to a limited industrial market. The amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate from period to period.\nHercules asbestos-related liability\nFrom the range of estimates, Ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs. Ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non-inflated, non-discounted approximate 40-year model developed with the assistance of Gnarus. As a result of the most recent annual update of this estimate, completed during 2023, it was determined that the liability for Hercules asbestos-related claims should be decreased by $2 million. Total reserves for asbestos claims were $191 million at September 30, 2023 compared to $213 million at September 30, 2022.\nHercules asbestos-related receivables\nFor the Hercules asbestos-related obligations, certain reimbursement obligations pursuant to coverage-in-place agreements with insurance carriers exist. As a result, any increases in the asbestos reserve have been partially offset by probable insurance recoveries. Ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on managements interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage, including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent. The estimated receivable consists exclusively of solvent domestic insurers.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the receivables from insurers amounted to $47 million and $52 million, respectively. During 2023, the annual update of the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers was completed. This model update resulted in a $3 million decrease in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries.\nAsbestos litigation cost projection\nProjecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are difficult to predict. In addition to the uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received, other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant and the related costs incurred in resolving those claims, mortality rates, dismissal rates, uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case. Furthermore, any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. In light of these inherent uncertainties, Ashland believes that the asbestos reserves for Ashland and Hercules represent the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes. As a part of the process to develop these estimates of future asbestos costs, a range of long-term cost models was developed. These models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long-term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs, as well as other variables mentioned previously. Ashland has currently estimated in various models ranging from approximately 40 year periods that it is reasonably possible that total future litigation defense and claim settlement costs on an inflated and undiscounted basis could range as high as approximately $422 million for the Ashland asbestos-related litigation (current reserve of $281 million) and approximately $288 million for the Hercules asbestos-related litigation (current reserve of $191 million), depending on the combination of assumptions selected in the various models. While the timeframe used in Ashland's models for projecting asbestos liabilities generally decreases over time based on the expected lifetime of the liabilities, these models have been consistently applied within all periods presented. If actual experience is worse than projected, relative to the number of claims filed, the severity of alleged disease associated with those claims or costs incurred to resolve those claims, or actuarial refinement or improvements to the assumptions used within these models are initiated, Ashland may need to further increase the estimates of the costs associated with asbestos claims and these increases could be material over time.\nM-37\nAccounting for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets\nGoodwill\nAshland accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance which does not allow for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets to be amortized.\nAshland reviews goodwill for impairment annually as of July 1 or when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. Ashland tests goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting units to the related carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. However, the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Reporting units are defined as either operating segments or one level below the operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by the business management. Ashland determined that its reporting units are Life Sciences, Personal Care, Specialty Additives and Intermediates.\nAshland makes various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow models and valuations based on earnings multiples for guideline public companies in each reporting units industry peer group, when externally quoted market prices are not readily available. Discounted cash flow models are reliant on various assumptions, including projected business results, long-term growth factors and weighted-average cost of capital. Management judgment is involved in estimating these variables, and they include uncertainties since they are forecasting future events. Ashland performs sensitivity analyses by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of the long-term growth rate and weighted average cost of capital estimates. Additionally, Ashland compares the indicated equity value to Ashlands market capitalization and evaluates the resulting implied control premium/discount to determine if the estimated enterprise value is reasonable.\nAshland performed its annual goodwill impairment using the quantitative approach as of July 1, 2023, and concluded that all reporting units had fair values in excess of its respective carrying amounts. The fair values of Life Sciences, Personal Care, and Specialty Additives exceeded their carrying values by 11%, 48%, and 28%, respectively. The Intermediates reporting unit has no associated goodwill. Ashland concluded there was no impairment as of July 1, 2023. Ashland compared the total fair values of the reporting units to Ashlands market capitalization at July 1, 2023, to determine if the fair values are reasonable. Ashland's market capitalization exceeded the aggregate fair value of each reporting unit at the annual assessment date by approximately 10%. A discount of 10% implies a high level of conservatism in Ashland's impairment assessment as recent comparable market transactions would imply control premiums of approximately 20% at the median (i.e., the premium of an offer price over the closing stock price immediately preceding an announced transaction).\nAssumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies include estimates of future projected business results (principally revenue and EBITDA), long-term growth rates, and the weighted-average cost of capital. Ashland performed sensitivity analyses by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of long-term growth rate and weighted average cost of capital estimates. Significant assumptions utilized in the impairment analysis included the weighted-average cost of capital, ranging between 10.75% and 11.25%, and terminal growth rate, ranging between 2.0% and 4.0% depending on the reporting unit. Based on sensitivity analysis performed on two key assumptions in the discounted cash flow model at July 1, 2023, a 1% decrease in the long-term growth factor assumption or a 1% increase in the weighted average cost of capital assumption across each of Ashlands reporting units would not have resulted in a fair value below the respective reporting units carrying value. For further information, see Note G of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther indefinite-lived intangible assets\nOther indefinite-lived intangible assets include certain trademarks and trade names. Ashland reviews these intangible assets for possible impairment annually as of July 1 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an individual indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the asset is written down to its fair value and the amount of the write down is the impairment charge. Similar to its annual assessment for goodwill, Ashland performs a quantitative test for impairment.\nM-38\nAshland tested these assets using a relief-from-royalty valuation method to determine the fair value. Assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, future projected business results, growth rates, the weighted-average cost of capital for a market participant, and royalty rates. In conjunction with the July 1 annual assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, Ashlands quantitative approach models did not indicate any impairment, as each indefinite-lived intangible assets fair value exceeded its carrying values.\nAshlands assessment of an impairment on any of these assets classified currently as having indefinite lives, including goodwill, could change in future periods if significant events happen and/or circumstances change that affect the previously mentioned assumptions. Assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, such estimates as future projected business results, growth rates, the weighted average cost of capital for a market participant, and royalty rates. For further information, see Note G of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome taxes\nAshland is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Judgment in the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results is required in determining Ashlands provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid, currently payable or receivable, and deferred taxes. Under U.S. GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax loss and credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the enactment date occurs. Valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested. In the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from Ashlands estimates and assumptions due to changes or future events such as tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material effect on the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and judgment by Ashland. If actual results differ from the estimates made by Ashland in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset. Additionally, the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities, which may result in future taxes, interest and penalties. Positive and negative evidence is considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which includes such evidence as historical earnings, projected future earnings, tax planning strategies and expected timing of reversal of existing temporary differences.\nIn determining the recoverability of deferred tax assets Ashland gives consideration to all available positive and negative evidence including reversals of deferred tax liabilities (other than those with an indefinite reversal period), projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. Ashland attaches the most weight to historical earnings due to their verifiable nature. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, Ashland considers three years of cumulative income or loss. In addition, Ashland has reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.\nM-39\nEFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES\nAshlands financial statements are prepared on the historical cost method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP and, as a result, do not reflect changes in the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar. Monetary assets (such as cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable) lose purchasing power as a result of inflation, while monetary liabilities (such as accounts payable and indebtedness) result in a gain, because they can be settled with dollars of diminished purchasing power. As of September 30, 2023, Ashlands monetary assets exceed its monetary liabilities, leaving it currently more exposed to the effects of future inflation. While inflation rose significantly during 2022, it began to decrease in fiscal 2023, and is expected to stabilize beyond fiscal 2023 according to forward economic outlooks. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for additional information.\nCertain of the industries in which Ashland operates are capital-intensive, and replacement costs for its plant and equipment generally would substantially exceed their historical costs. Accordingly, depreciation and amortization expense would be greater if it were based on current replacement costs. However, because replacement facilities would reflect technological improvements and changes in business strategies, such facilities would be expected to be more productive than existing facilities, mitigating at least part of the increased expense.\nM-40\nOUTLOOK\nPortfolio-optimization actions\nAs previously disclosed on November 1, 2023, Ashland is taking the following portfolio-optimization actions to further strengthen the Companys resilience and improve margins and returns in this uncertain environment:\nCommencing a divestiture process for the Companys nutraceuticals business;\nOptimizing and consolidating the Company's carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and methyl cellulose (MC) industrial businesses and related capacity to improve productivity and mix;\nDeveloping plans to repurpose the impacted CMC and MC assets to support other longer-term growth initiatives;\nOptimizing the Companys global hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) manufacturing network for greater efficiency; and\nIncreasing resources and investments to drive the Company's higher-value globalize and innovate strategy.\nWhen completed, these portfolio actions are expected to result in improved Adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 200 basis-points and returns on net assets of 150 to 200 basis-points. These actions are expected to reduce volatility, improve focus and decrease working capital and maintenance capital expenditures. The impact of these portfolio actions is expected to reduce annual sales by approximately $200 million to $225 million. Ashland plans to take actions to fully offset the approximately $100 million of stranded costs and lost gross profit that is expected to result from these actions.\nAt the same time, the Company plans to increase its investments and resources for the core growth businesses consistent with the globalize and innovate strategy that was outlined at the Companys recent Innovation Day. During fiscal year 2024 the Company plans to deploy an incremental $4-6 million in commercial and technical resources to support this growth.\nFinancial Outlook\nAs part of Ashland's regular financial planning process and in concert with extensive customer discussions, the Company has analyzed numerous demand-recovery scenarios for fiscal year 2024. While there is evidence that customer destocking across many end markets is slowing, a great deal of uncertainty remains. The Companys view is that recovery is likely to be back-end loaded into the second half of the fiscal year. In addition, consideration for the impact in fiscal 2024 of the announced portfolio-optimization actions is being layered into forecast models as the commercial teams engage with customers. Given the overall uncertainty, at this time the Company is not issuing an outlook for fiscal year 2024 but will provide an update regarding its financial outlook during its fiscal-first quarter earnings call.\nFor the fiscal-first quarter of 2024, demand in October has demonstrated some sequential improvement, though customer destocking continues across many end markets. First-quarter 2024 financial results will include carryover impacts from internal inventory-control actions that will negatively impact results compared to prior year. Customer order lead times have returned to more normalized levels and November orders are consistent with expectations. At this time, visibility into December demand is limited and uncertainty remains as to whether some customers decide to take year-end inventory control actions. Taking these factors into account, for the fiscal-first quarter of 2024 the company expects sales in the range of $470 million to $490 million and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $55 million to $65 million.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements made under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation (MD&A), within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Ashland has identified some of these forward-looking statements with words such as anticipates, believes, expects, estimates, is likely, predicts, projects, forecasts, objectives, may, will, should, plans and intends and the negative of these words or other comparable terminology. Ashland may from time to time make forward-looking statements in its Annual Report to Stockholders, quarterly reports and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), news releases and other written and oral communications. These forward-looking statements are based on Ashlands expectations and assumptions, as of the date such statements are made, regarding Ashlands future operating performance and financial condition, as well as the economy and other future events or circumstances. Ashlands expectations\nM-41\nand assumptions include, without limitation, those mentioned within the MD&A, internal forecasts and analyses of current and future market conditions and trends, management plans and strategies, operating efficiencies, cost savings and economic conditions (such as prices, supply and demand, cost of raw materials, and the ability to recover raw-material cost increases through price increases), and risks and uncertainties associated with the following: the impact of acquisitions and/or divestitures Ashland has made or may make (including the possibility that Ashland may not realize the anticipated benefits from such transactions); Ashlands substantial indebtedness (including the possibility that such indebtedness and related restrictive covenants may adversely affect Ashlands future cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and its ability to repay debt); execution risks associated with our growth strategies; the competitive nature of our business; severe weather, natural disasters, public health crises (including the COVID-19 pandemic), cyber events and legal proceedings and claims (including product recalls, environmental and asbestos matters); the ongoing Ukraine/Russia and Israel/Hamas conflict on the geographies in which Ashland operates, the end markets Ashland serves and on Ashlands supply chain and customers; and without limitation, risks and uncertainties affecting Ashland that are contained in Use of estimates, risks and uncertainties in Note A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in Item 1A of this Annual Report Form 10-K. Various risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, projected or implied by any forward-looking statements. Ashland believes its expectations and assumptions are reasonable, but there can be no assurance that the expectations reflected herein will be achieved. Unless legally required, Ashland undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Information on Ashlands website is not incorporated into or a part of this Form 10-K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAshland conducts business in a variety of foreign currencies. Accordingly, Ashland regularly uses foreign currency derivative instruments to manage exposure on certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies to curtail potential earnings volatility effects of certain assets and liabilities, including short-term intercompany loans, denominated in currencies other than Ashlands functional currency of an entity. These derivative contracts generally require exchange of one foreign currency for another at a fixed rate at a future date and generally have maturities of less than twelve months. All contracts are valued at fair value with net changes in fair value recorded within the selling, general and administrative expense caption. The impacts of these contracts were largely offset by gains and losses resulting from the impact of changes in exchange rates on transactions denominated in non-functional currencies.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, Ashland had not identified any significant credit risk on open derivative contracts. The potential loss from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates on Ashlands open foreign currency derivative instruments would be largely offset by gains resulting from the impact of changes in exchange rates on transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. Ashland did not have any significant open hedging contracts with respect to commodities or any related raw material requirements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nM-42 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nManagement's report on internal control over financial reporting\nReports of independent registered public accounting firm (Ernst & Young LLP; PCAOB ID: 42)\nConsolidated Financial Statements:\nStatements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nStatements of Consolidated Equity\nStatements of Consolidated Cash Flows\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nMANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Accounting principles are selected, and information is reported which, using managements best judgment and estimates, present fairly Ashlands consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The other financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is consistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAshlands management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Ashlands internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Ashlands Consolidated Financial Statements. Ashlands internal control over financial reporting is supported by a code of business conduct which summarizes our guiding values such as obeying the law, adhering to high ethical standards and acting as responsible members of the communities where we operate. Compliance with that Code forms the foundation of our internal control systems, which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that Ashlands assets are safeguarded, and its records reflect, in all material respects, transactions in accordance with managements authorization. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition that the cost of a system of internal control should not exceed the related benefits. Management believes that adequate internal controls are maintained by the selection and training of qualified personnel, by an appropriate division of responsibility in all organizational arrangements, by the establishment and communication of accounting and business policies, and by internal audits.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Board, subject to stockholder ratification, selects and engages the independent auditors based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee, composed of directors who are not members of management, reviews the adequacy of Ashlands policies, procedures, controls and risk management strategies, the scope of auditing and other services performed by the independent auditors, and the scope of the internal audit function. The Audit Committee holds meetings with Ashlands internal auditor and independent auditors, with and without management present, to discuss the findings of their audits, the overall quality of Ashlands financial reporting and their evaluation of Ashlands internal controls. The report of Ashlands Audit Committee can be found in Ashlands Proxy for its 2024 Annual Meeting.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of Ashlands internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. Management conducted its assessment utilizing the framework described in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management believes that Ashland maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023.\nErnst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited and reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Ashland Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023, and the effectiveness of Ashlands internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. The reports of the independent registered public accounting firm are contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n/s/ Guillermo Novo\nGuillermo Novo\nChair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n/s/ J. Kevin Willis\nJ. Kevin Willis\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nNovember 17, 2023\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Ashland Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Ashland Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Ashland Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated November 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nGrandview Heights, Ohio\nNovember 17, 2023\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Ashland Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ashland Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated November 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nValuation of Environmental Remediation Reserves\nDescription of the Matter\nAt September 30, 2023, the reserves for environmental remediation amounted to $214 million. As discussed within Note M of the consolidated financial statements, the reserves for environmental remediation reflect Ashlands estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable and probable of being incurred, without regard to any third-party recoveries. The Company uses engineering studies, historical experience and other factors to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation. Ashland regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues.\nAuditing the environmental remediation reserve was complex due to inherent uncertainties that affect Ashlands ability to estimate probable costs. Such uncertainties include the nature and extent of contamination at each site, and the nature and extent of required cleanup efforts.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant controls over Ashlands environmental remediation process. For example, we tested controls over the Companys annual reserve setting training process, managements identification and monitoring of new and existing sites, and managements development of the environmental reserve estimates. We also tested managements controls over the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the reserve estimates.\nTo test the environmental reserves, we performed audit procedures that included, among others: assessing the appropriateness of Ashlands policies and procedures and testing managements development of the environmental reserve estimates. We obtained an understanding of the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the nature and extent of required cleanup efforts, and the corresponding environmental remediation reserves through discussions with Ashlands remediation project managers. We also involved our environmental reserve subject matter specialists to evaluate the reasonableness of managements reserve estimates, including consideration of information available on regulatory databases in the public domain that was assessed for possible contrary evidence. With the support of our environmental reserve subject matter specialists, we evaluated whether the environmental reserve estimates were appropriate based on engineering studies and historical experience.\nValuation of Asbestos Litigation Reserves\nDescription of the Matter\nAt September 30, 2023, the reserves for asbestos litigation amounted to $472 million. As discussed within Note M of the consolidated financial statements, Ashland has liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Ashland retained third party actuarial experts to assist in developing and annually updating independent reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs given various assumptions. The methodology used by the actuarial experts to project future asbestos costs is based largely on recent experience, including claim-filing and settlement rates, disease mix, open claims and litigation defense. Further, the claim experience identified is compared to the results of previously conducted third party epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases. Using that information, the Company estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed, as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims. Ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs using the results of a non-inflated, non-discounted approximate 40-year model developed with the assistance of the Companys third party actuarial experts.\nAuditing the Companys asbestos litigation reserve was complex due to uncertainty associated with the estimate of projected future asbestos costs. The methodology employed by management to develop the estimate of projected future asbestos costs is subject to assumptions such as the number of claims that may be received in the future, the type and severity of disease alleged by claimant, the related costs incurred in resolving those claims, and the dismissal rates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the asbestos litigation reserve.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the asbestos litigation reserves process. These include controls over management's assessment of the assumptions utilized within the estimate, managements oversight of asbestos trends including claims movement and costs incurred, and the completeness and accuracy of the underlying claims data utilized to project future costs.\nTo evaluate the reasonableness of the reserve for asbestos litigation, our audit procedures included testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying claims data provided to management's actuarial experts utilized to project future costs. Additionally, we evaluated the claims and spend activity from legal letters obtained from internal and external legal counsel. Furthermore, we involved our actuarial subject matter specialists to assist in the evaluation of the methodologies and assumptions applied by management's experts as described above to determine the appropriateness of the asbestos litigation reserve, and to independently prepare an estimated range of the liability. We then assessed the reasonableness of the Company's recorded reserve against our independently calculated range.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2014.\nGrandview Heights, Ohio\nNovember 17, 2023\nAshland Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries\nStatements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nYears Ended September 30\n(In millions except per share data)\nSales\n$\n2,191\n$\n2,391\n$\n2,111\nCost of sales\n1,523\n1,561\n1,441\nGross profit\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nResearch and development expense\nIntangibles amortization expense -

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Ashland Inc. (Ashland) and its majority owned subsidiaries and, when applicable, entities for which Ashland has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. Investments in joint ventures and 20% to 50% owned affiliates where Ashland has the ability to exert significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Ashland has no significant equity method investments as of September 30, 2023. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nAshland is comprised of the following reportable segments: Life Sciences, Personal Care, Specialty Additives and Intermediates. Unallocated and Other includes corporate governance activities and certain legacy matters. See Note Q for more information.\nUse of estimates, risks and uncertainties\nThe preparation of Ashlands Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, environmental remediation, asbestos litigation, the accounting for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and income taxes. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAshlands results are affected by domestic and international economic, political, legislative, regulatory and legal actions. Economic conditions, such as recessionary trends, inflation, interest and monetary exchange rates, government fiscal policies and changes in the prices of certain key raw materials, can have a significant effect on operations. While Ashland maintains reserves for anticipated liabilities and carries various levels of insurance, Ashland could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings relating to asbestos, environmental remediation, income taxes or other matters.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments maturing within three months after purchase.\nAllowance for credit losses on accounts receivable\nAshland records an allowance for credit losses using the expected credit loss model. Ashland estimates expected credit losses based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. When measuring expected credit losses, Ashland pools assets with similar country risk and credit risk characteristics. Each period the allowance for credit losses is adjusted through earnings to reflect expected credit losses over the remaining lives of the assets. No significant credit losses were incurred in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nA progression of activity in the allowance for credit losses is presented in the following table.\n(In millions)\nAllowance for credit losses - beginning of year\n$\n$\n$\nAdjustments to allowances for credit losses\nReserves utilized\n(2\n)\n(1\n)\n(1\n)\nAllowance for credit losses - end of year\n$\n$\n$\nInventories\nInventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories are stated at cost using the weighted-average cost method. This method values inventories using average costs for raw materials and most recent production costs for labor and overhead.\nThe following summarizes Ashlands inventories as of the Consolidated Balance Sheet dates.\n(In millions)\nFinished products\n$\n$\nRaw materials, supplies and work in process\n$\n$\nA progression of activity in the inventory reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventories, which reduce the amounts of finished products and raw materials, supplies and work in process reported, is presented in the following table.\n(In millions)\nInventory reserves - beginning of year\n$\n$\n$\nAdjustments to inventory reserves\nReserves utilized\n(3\n)\n(3\n)\n(5\n)\nInventory reserves - end of year\n$\n$\n$\nProperty, plant and equipment\nThe cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings are depreciated principally over 12 to 35 years and machinery and equipment principally over 2 to 25 years. Such costs are periodically reviewed for recoverability when impairment indicators are present. Such indicators include, among other factors, operating losses, unused capacity, market value declines and technological obsolescence. Recorded values of asset groups of property, plant and equipment that are not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows are written down to current fair value, which generally is determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows (assets held for use) or net realizable value (assets held for sale). See Note F for additional information related to property, plant and equipment.\nLeasing arrangements\nAshland determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception based on whether or not it has the right to control the asset during the contract period and other facts and circumstances.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets represent Ashlands right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent Ashlands obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease, both of which are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception are not recorded within the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). The lease term is determined by assuming the exercise of renewal options that are reasonably certain. As most leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, Ashland used its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. When contracts contain lease and non-lease components, Ashland generally accounts for both components as a single lease component. For additional information on leasing arrangements, see Note J.\nGoodwill and other intangibles\nAshland tests goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of July 1 and when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. Ashland reviews goodwill for impairment based on its identified reporting units. Ashland determined that its reporting units are Life Sciences, Personal Care, Specialty Additives and Intermediates. Ashland tests goodwill for impairment by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value of its reporting units. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. However, the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\nUsing the quantitative approach, Ashland makes various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow models and valuations based on earnings multiples for guideline public companies in each reporting units industry peer group, when externally quoted market prices are not readily available. Discounted cash flow models are\nreliant on various assumptions, including projected business results, long-term growth factors and weighted-average cost of capital. Management judgment is involved in estimating these variables, and they include uncertainties since they are forecasting future events. Ashland performs sensitivity analyses by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of the long-term growth rate and weighted average cost of capital. Additionally, Ashland compares the indicated equity value to Ashlands market capitalization and evaluates the resulting implied control premium/discount to determine if the estimated enterprise value is reasonable.\nAshland tests at least annually its indefinite-lived intangible assets, principally trademarks and trade names. If the carrying value of an individual indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, such individual indefinite-lived intangible asset is written down by an amount equal to such excess. Ashland performs a quantitative impairment test for the trademarks and trade names during which, trademarks and trade names are valued using a relief-from-royalty valuation method compared to the carrying value. Assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, such estimates as future projected business results, growth rates, the weighted-average cost of capital for a market participant, and royalty rates.\nFinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of certain trademarks and trade names, intellectual property, and customer lists. These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The cost of trademarks and trade names is amortized principally over 3 to 20 years, intellectual property over 3 to 20 years and customer and supplier relationships over 10 to 24 years. Ashland reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Ashland monitors these changes and events on at least a quarterly basis. The intangibles amortization expense caption within the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) includes amortization expense related to trademarks and trade names, intellectual property and customer and supplier relationships. Intangible assets classified as finite are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. For further information on goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note G.\nDerivative instruments\nAshland regularly uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies and certain commodities. All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and are measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Gains and losses related to an instrument that qualifies for hedge accounting are either recognized in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) immediately to offset the gain or loss on the hedged item, or deferred and recorded in the stockholders equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) when the hedged item affects net income. For additional information on derivative instruments, see Note E.\nRestricted investments\nDuring 2015, Ashland placed $335 million of insurance proceeds into a renewable annual trust for asbestos (Asbestos trust) that Ashland determined is restricted for the purpose of paying ongoing and future litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in conjunction with asbestos claims. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the funds within the Asbestos trust had a balance of $243 million and $245 million, respectively, and were primarily invested in public equity, U.S. government bonds and investment grade corporate bond investments with a portion maintained in demand deposits. These funds are presented primarily as noncurrent assets within the restricted investments caption of the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with $37 million and $27 million classified within other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDuring 2021, Ashland established a renewable annual trust for environmental remediation (Environmental trust) that Ashland determined is restricted for ongoing and future environmental remediation and related litigation costs. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the funds within the Environmental trust had a balance of $124 million and $129 million, respectively, and were primarily invested in public equity, U.S. government bonds and investment grade corporate bond investments with a portion maintained in demand deposits. These funds are presented primarily as noncurrent assets within the restricted investments caption of the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with $40 million and $34 million classified within other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe funds within these trusts are classified as investment securities reported at fair value. Interest income and gains and losses (realized and unrealized) on the investment securities are reported in the net interest and other expense caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). See Note E for additional information regarding the fair value of these investments within the trusts.\nRevenue recognition\nAshlands revenue is measured as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods and is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied under the terms of contracts or purchase orders with customers. Ashland generally utilizes standardized language for the terms of contracts or purchase orders.\nA performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied by Ashland when control of the product or service is transferred to the customer. The transaction price of a contract or purchase order, or the amount Ashland expects to receive upon satisfaction of all performance obligations, is determined by reference to the applicable terms. Ashland generally collects the cash from its customers within 60 days of the product delivery date. Sales and other similar taxes collected from customers on behalf of third parties are excluded from the contract price.\nAll of Ashlands revenue is derived from contracts or purchase orders with customers, and nearly all contracts or purchase orders with customers contain a single performance obligation for the transfer of goods where such performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. Control of a product is deemed to be transferred to the customer generally upon shipment or delivery. Costs for shipping and handling activities, whether performed before or after the customer obtains control of the goods, are accounted for as fulfillment costs when not reimbursed.\nCosts incurred to obtain contracts with customers are not significant and are expensed immediately as the period of performance is generally one year or less. Ashland records credit losses in specific situations when it is determined that the customer is unable to meet its financial obligation.\nExpense recognition\nCost of sales include material and production costs, as well as the costs of inbound and outbound freight, purchasing and receiving, inspection, warehousing, internal transfers and all other distribution network costs. Selling, general and administrative expense includes sales and marketing costs, advertising, customer support, environmental remediation, corporate and divisional administrative and other costs. Advertising costs ($2 million in 2023, $2 million in 2022 and $1 million in 2021) and research and development costs ($51 million in 2023, $55 million in 2022 and $50 million in 2021) are expensed as incurred.\nIncome taxes\nAshland is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid, currently payable or receivable, and deferred taxes. Ashland recognizes the income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Ashland evaluates and adjusts these accruals based on changing facts and circumstances. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax loss and credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the enactment date occurs. Taxes due on future Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) inclusions in U.S. are recognized as a current period expense when incurred. Valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. In the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from Ashlands estimates and assumptions due to changes or future events such as tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material effect on the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information on income taxes, see Note K.\nA progression of activity in the tax valuation allowances is presented in the following table.\n(In millions)\nTax valuation allowances - beginning of year\n$\n$\n$\nAdjustments to valuation allowances\n(1\n)\n(19\n)\nReserves utilized\n(10\n)\nTax valuation allowances - end of year\n$\n$\n$\nAsbestos-related litigation\nAshland is subject to liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Such claims result from indemnification obligations undertaken in 1990 in connection with the sale of Riley Stoker Corporation (Riley) and the acquisition of Hercules in November 2008. Although Riley, a former subsidiary, was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos, its industrial boilers contained some asbestos-containing components provided by other companies. Hercules, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Ashland, has liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Such claims typically arise from alleged exposure to asbestos fibers from resin encapsulated pipe and tank products sold by one of Hercules former subsidiaries to a limited industrial market.\nAshland retained Gnarus Advisors LLC (Gnarus) to assist in developing and annually updating independent reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs given various assumptions. The methodology used to project future asbestos costs is based largely on Ashlands recent experience, including claim-filing and settlement rates, disease mix, open claims, and litigation defense. Ashlands claim experience is compared to the results of previously conducted epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases. Those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population expected to have been exposed to asbestos. Using that information, Gnarus estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed, as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims. Ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs using the results of a non-inflated, non-discounted approximate 40-year model. For additional information on asbestos-related litigation, see Note M.\nEnvironmental remediation\nAccruals for environmental remediation are recognized when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of that liability can be reasonably estimated. Such costs are charged to expense if they relate to the remediation of conditions caused by past operations or are not expected to mitigate or prevent contamination from future operations. Accruals for environmental remediation reflect Ashland's estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period of time to remediate identified conditions for which costs are reasonably estimatible and probable of being incurred, without regard to any third-party recoveries, and are regularly adjusted as environmental assessments and remediation efforts continue. For additional information on environmental remediation, see Note M.\nPension and other postretirement benefits\nThe funded status of Ashlands pension and other postretirement benefit plans is recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at September 30, the measurement date. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and for the other postretirement benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO). The PBO represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement based on estimated future compensation levels. The APBO represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already rendered. The measurement of the benefit obligation is based on Ashlands estimates and actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect the terms of the plans and use participant-specific information such as compensation, age and years of service, as well as certain assumptions that require judgment, including, but not limited to, estimates of discount rates, rate of compensation increases, interest rates and mortality rates. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of assets held by an irrevocable trust fund for the sole benefit of participants. For additional information regarding plan assumptions and the current financial position of the pension and other postretirement plans, see Note L.\nAshland recognizes the change in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement. The remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense are recorded ratably on a quarterly basis. Pension and other postretirement benefits adjustments charged directly to cost of sales that are applicable to inactive participants are excluded from inventoriable costs. The service cost component of pension and other postretirement benefits costs is allocated to each reportable segment; while the remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits costs are recorded within the other net periodic benefit loss (income) caption on the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nForeign currency translation\nSubsidiaries outside the United States primarily use the local currency as the functional currency. Upon consolidation, the results of operations of the subsidiaries and affiliates whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates for the year while assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Adjustments to translate assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are recorded in the stockholders equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are included in net earnings only upon sale or substantial liquidation of the underlying foreign subsidiary or affiliated company.\nStock incentive plans\nAshland recognizes compensation expense for stock incentive plans awarded to key employees and directors over the requisite service period based upon the grant-date fair value. Stock incentive awards are primarily in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance shares and other non-vested stock awards. Ashland utilizes several industry accepted valuation models to determine grant-date fair value. For further information concerning stock incentive plans, see Note O.\nEarnings per share\nThe following is the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations attributable to Ashland. Earnings per share are reported under the treasury stock method. SARs and warrants for each reported year whose grant price was greater than the market price of Ashland Common Stock at the end of each fiscal year were not included in the computation of earnings per share from continuing operations per diluted share because the effect of these instruments would be antidilutive. The total number of these shares outstanding was 1.2 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021. The majority of these shares are for warrants with a strike price of $128.66.\n(In millions except per share data)\nNumerator\nNumerator for basic and diluted EPS - Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax\n$\n$\n$\nDenominator\nDenominator for basic EPS - Weighted-average common shares outstanding\nShare based awards convertible to common shares\nDenominator for diluted EPS - Adjusted weighted - average shares and assumed conversions\nEPS from continuing operations\nBasic\n$\n3.18\n$\n3.26\n$\n2.85\nDiluted\n$\n3.13\n$\n3.20\n$\n2.82\nOther accounting pronouncements\nIn December 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2022-06 \"Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848.\" The ASU was issued to provide an update on ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 that were issued in March 2020 and January 2021, respectively, which provided practical expedients simplifying the U.S. GAAP treatment of certain reference rate related contract modifications including hedging relationships and other agreements. Specifically, the guidance eased the accounting burden of the modification of the reference rate of contracts where the underlying reference rate was the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). With the issuance of ASU 2022-06, the sunset date of Topic 848 has been deferred from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848. This guidance did not have a material impact on Ashland's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\" The ASU amended accounting guidance related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. The amended accounting guidance changes the impairment model for most financial assets to require measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. This guidance became effective for Ashland on October 1, 2020. As a result, Ashland recorded a $3 million increase in its allowance for credit losses, primarily related to asbestos receivables, and a $2 million decrease to retained earnings, net of tax, reflecting the cumulative effect on retained earnings.\nNOTE B - DIVESTITURES\nPerformance Adhesives\nOn February 28, 2022, Ashland completed the sale of its Performance Adhesives business to Arkema, a French soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme. Proceeds from the sale were approximately $1.7 billion, net of transaction costs. Ashland recognized a $726 million after-tax gain on sale within the Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022.\nThe transaction represented a strategic shift in Ashlands business and had a major effect on Ashlands operations and financial results. Accordingly, the operating results and cash flows related to Performance Adhesives have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows, while the assets and liabilities that were sold have been classified within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as held for sale in periods preceding the sale. See Note C for the results of operations for Performance Adhesives for all periods presented.\nCertain indirect corporate costs included within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) that were previously allocated to the Performance Adhesives segment do not qualify for classification within discontinued operations and are now reported as selling, general and administrative expense within continuing operations on a consolidated basis and within the Unallocated and other segment. These costs were zero, $9 million and $15 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 respectively.\nOther manufacturing facility sales\nDuring 2023, Ashland entered into and completed a definitive sale agreement to sell a Specialty Additives manufacturing facility for less than $1 million. The net asset value related to this site was $4 million at September 30, 2022. Ashland recorded a $4 million impairment charge within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) during the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 related to this site.\nDuring 2020, Ashland entered into a definitive sale agreement to sell a Specialty Additives facility, the assets and liabilities of which were classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2020. During 2021, Ashland completed the sale of the Specialty Additives facility. Net proceeds received from the sale were approximately $20 million ($14 million of which was received during the twelve months September 30, 2021). The company recognized a pre-tax gain of $14 million recorded within the income on acquisition and divestitures, net caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021.\nAshland determined that these transactions did not qualify for discontinued operations treatment since neither represented a strategic shift that had or will have a major effect on Ashlands operations and financial results.\nOther corporate assets\nDuring 2023, Ashland completed the sale of two excess land properties with a net book value of $2 million. Ashland received net proceeds of approximately $9 million and recorded a pre-tax gain of $7 million within the income on acquisitions and divestitures caption within the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for 2023.\nDuring 2022, Ashland completed the sale of two excess land properties with a net book value of $8 million as of September 30, 2021. Ashland received net proceeds of approximately $50 million and recorded pre-tax gain of $42 million within the income on acquisitions and divestitures caption within the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for 2022.\nNOTE C - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nAshland has divested certain businesses that have qualified as discontinued operations. The operating results from these divested businesses and subsequent adjustments related to ongoing assessments and activities of certain retained liabilities and tax items have been recorded within the discontinued operations caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for all periods presented and are discussed further within this note.\nDue to the ongoing assessment of certain matters associated with previous divestitures, subsequent adjustments to these divestitures may continue in future periods in the discontinued operations caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nThe following divested businesses represent disposal groups that qualified as discontinued operations in previous periods and impacted discontinued operations:\nThe Performance Adhesives business divested in 2022;\nThe Composites business and Marl facility (Composites/Marl facility) divested in 2019;\nThe separation of Valvoline Inc. (Valvoline) business divested in 2017;\nThe sale of Ashland Water Technologies (Water Technologies) business divested in 2014; and\nThe sale of the Ashland Distribution (Distribution) business divested in 2011.\nAdditionally, Ashland is subject to liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Such claims result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in 1990 in connection with the sale of Riley Stoker Corporation (Riley), a former subsidiary, which qualified as a discontinued operation and from the acquisition during 2009 of Hercules LLC (formerly Hercules Incorporated), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Ashland. Adjustments to the recorded litigation reserves and related insurance receivables are recorded within the discontinued operations caption. See Note M for more information related to the adjustments on asbestos liabilities and receivables.\nComponents of amounts reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) related to discontinued operations are presented in the following table for each of the years ended September 30.\n(In millions)\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations\nPerformance Adhesives\n$\n(1\n)\n$\n$\nComposites/Marl facility\n(1\n)\n-\n(1\n)\nValvoline\n(7\n)\n(33\n)\nWater Technologies\n-\n(4\n)\nDistribution\n(5\n)\n(9\n)\n(6\n)\nAsbestos-related litigation\n(6\n)\n(17\n)\n(11\n)\nGain on disposal of discontinued operations\nPerformance Adhesives\n-\n1,063\n-\nComposites/Marl facility\n-\n-\n(4\n)\nWater Technologies\n-\n-\nIncome before taxes\n1,068\nIncome tax benefit (expense)\nBenefit (expense) related to income (loss) from discontinued operations\nPerformance Adhesives\n(19\n)\nComposites/Marl facility\n-\nValvoline\n-\nWater Technologies\n-\n(1\n)\nDistribution\nAsbestos-related litigation\nExpense related to gain on disposal of discontinued operations\nPerformance Adhesives\n-\n(337\n)\n-\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\n$\n$\n$\nPerformance Adhesives divestiture\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the captions within Ashlands Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss) for the income from discontinued operations attributable to the Performance Adhesives segment for each of the years ended September 30.\n(In millions)\nIncome(loss) from discontinued operations attributable to Performance Adhesives\nSales\n$\n$\nCost of sales\n(122\n)\n(256\n)\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n(12\n)\n(25\n)\nResearch and development expense\n(4\n)\n(8\n)\nIntangible amortization expense\n-\n(1\n)\nPretax operating income of discontinued operations\nOther net periodic benefit loss (income)\n-\n(1\n)\nPretax income of discontinued operations\nIncome tax expense\n(19\n)\nIncome from discontinued operations\n$\n$\nNOTE D - RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES\nRestructuring activities\nAshland periodically implements company-wide and targeted restructuring programs related to acquisitions, divestitures and other cost reduction programs in order to enhance profitability through streamlined operations and an improved overall cost structure.\nFiscal 2023 restructuring costs\nDuring fiscal 2023, Ashland implemented targeted organizational restructuring actions to reduce costs. Ashland recorded severance expense of $5 million during 2023 within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). As of September 30, 2023, the severance reserve associated with this program was $3 million within accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFiscal 2023 Life Sciences restructuring program\nDuring 2023, Ashland implemented a restructuring program within the Nutraceuticals business of the Life Sciences segment. Ashland recorded severance expense of $1 million during 2023 within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). As of September 30, 2023, the severance reserve associated with this program was zero.\nFiscal 2020 restructuring costs\nDuring 2022 and 2021, Ashland realized severance income of $2 million and $1 million, respectively, attributable to executive management changes and business management changes within the organization initiated in fiscal 2020 within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). As of September 30, 2023 and 2022 the severance reserve associated with this transition was zero and $1 million, respectively.\nThe following table details at September 30, 2023, the amount of restructuring severance reserves related to this program. The severance reserves were primarily recorded within accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2022.\n(In millions)\nSeverance costs\nBalance as of September 30, 2021\n$\nRestructuring reserve\n(2\n)\nUtilization (cash paid)\n(3\n)\nBalance as of September 30, 2022\n$\nRestructuring reserve\n(1\n)\nUtilization (cash paid)\n-\nBalance as of September 30, 2023\n$\n-\nImpairments\nDuring 2021, Ashland incurred $3 million of asset impairment charges related to restructuring activities at a plant originating from the shutdown of a product line recorded within the cost of sales caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). In addition, Ashland incurred a $10 million capital project impairment recorded within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nNOTE E - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, Ashland uses applicable guidance for defining fair value, the initial recording and periodic remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value and related disclosures for instruments measured at fair value. Fair value accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). An instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instruments fair value measurement. The three levels within the fair value hierarchy are described as follows.\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for which there is little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs reflect Ashlands own assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might include Ashlands own financial data such as internally developed pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, as well as instruments for which the fair value determination requires significant management judgment.\nFor assets that are measured using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1), the total fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs. Assets and liabilities that are measured using significant other observable inputs (Level 2) are primarily valued by reference to quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets, adjusted for any terms specific to that asset or liability. For all other assets and liabilities for which unobservable inputs are used (Level 3), fair value is derived through the use of fair value models, such as a discounted cash flow model or other standard pricing models that Ashland deems reasonable.\nThe following table summarizes financial instruments subject to recurring fair value measurements as of September 30, 2023. For additional information on fair value hierarchy measurements of pension plan asset holdings, see Note L.\nQuoted prices\nin active\nSignificant\nmarkets for\nother\nSignificant\nidentical\nobservable\nunobservable\nCarrying\nTotal fair\nassets\ninputs\ninputs\n(In millions)\nvalue\nvalue\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\nRestricted investments (a) (b)\n-\n-\nInvestments of captive insurance company (c)\n-\n-\nForeign currency derivatives (d)\n-\n-\nTotal assets at fair value\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n-\nLiabilities\nForeign currency derivatives (e)\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n$\n-\nCommodity derivatives (e)\n-\n-\nTotal liabilities at fair value\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n$\n-\n(a)\tIncluded in restricted investments and $77 million within other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(b)\tIncludes $243 million related to the Asbestos trust and $124 million related to the Environmental trust.

The financial instruments are designated as investment securities, primarily classified as Level 1 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. These securities were\nclassified primarily as noncurrent restricted investment assets, with $77 million and $61 million classified within other current assets, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the periods ended in September 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table presents gross unrealized gains and losses for the restricted securities as of September 30, 2023 and 2022:\nGross\nGross\n(In millions)\nAdjusted Cost\nUnrealized Gain\nUnrealized Loss\nFair Value\nAs of September 30, 2023\nDemand deposit\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\nEquity mutual fund\n(2\n)\nFixed income mutual fund\n-\n(48\n)\nFair value\n$\n$\n$\n(50\n)\n$\nAs of September 30, 2022\nDemand deposit\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\nEquity mutual fund\n(25\n)\nFixed income mutual fund\n-\n(47\n)\nFair value\n$\n$\n$\n(72\n)\n$\nThe following table presents the investment income, net gains and losses realized, funds restricted for specific transactions, and disbursements related to the investments within the restricted investments portfolio during 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n(In millions)\nInvestment income (a)\n$\n$\n$\nNet gains (losses) (a)\n(102\n)\nFunds restricted for specific transactions\nDisbursements\n(58\n)\n(35\n)\n(33\n)\n(a)\tIncluded in the net interest and other expense caption within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nForeign currency derivatives\nAshland conducts business in a variety of foreign currencies. Accordingly, Ashland regularly uses foreign currency derivative instruments to manage exposure on certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies to curtail potential earnings volatility effects of certain assets and liabilities, including short-term intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than Ashlands functional currency of an entity. These derivative contracts generally require exchange of one foreign currency for another at a fixed rate at a future date and generally have maturities of less than twelve months. All contracts are valued at fair value with net changes in fair value recorded within the selling, general and administrative expense caption. The impacts of these contracts were largely offset by gains and losses resulting from the impact of changes in exchange rates on transactions denominated in non-functional currencies.\nThe following table summarizes the gains and losses recognized during 2023, 2022 and 2021 within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n(In millions)\nForeign currency derivative gains (losses) (a)\n$\n$\n(40\n)\n$\n(a)\tIncludes a $1 million gain reported within the income on acquisitions and divestitures, net caption for fiscal 2021.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivatives as of September 30, 2023, and 2022 included in accounts receivable and accrued expenses and other liabilities of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(In millions)\nForeign currency derivative assets\n$\n$\nNotional contract values\nForeign currency derivative liabilities\n$\n$\nNotional contract values\nCommodity derivatives\nTo manage its exposure to the market price volatility of natural gas consumed by its U.S. plants during the manufacturing process, Ashland regularly enters into forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges. See Note A for more information.\nThe following table summarizes the gains and losses recognized during 2023, 2022, 2021 within the cost of sales caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n(In millions)\nCommodity derivative gains (losses)\n$\n(3\n)\n$\n$\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the outstanding commodity derivatives as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 included in accounts receivable and accrued expenses and other liabilities of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(In millions)\nCommodity derivative assets\n$\n-\n$\nNotional contract values\nCommodity derivative liabilities\n$\n$\nNotional contract values\nOther financial instruments\nAt September 30, 2023 and 2022, Ashlands long-term debt (including the current portion and excluding debt issuance cost discounts) had carrying values of $1,327 million and $1,284 million, respectively, compared to a fair value of $1,160 million and $1,102 million, respectively. The fair values of long-term debt are based on quoted market prices.\nNOTE F - PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nThe following table describes the various components of property, plant and equipment within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022.\n(In millions)\nLand\n$\n$\nBuildings\nMachinery and equipment\n2,371\n2,324\nConstruction in progress\nTotal property, plant and equipment (gross)\n3,211\n3,050\nAccumulated depreciation\n(1,838\n)\n(1,712\n)\nTotal property, plant and equipment (net)\n$\n1,373\n$\n1,338\nThe following table summarizes various property, plant and equipment charges recognized during 2023, 2022, 2021 within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\n(In millions)\nDepreciation\n$\n$\n$\nCapitalized interest\nNOTE G - GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES\nGoodwill\nAshland performed its annual goodwill impairment test using the quantitative approach as of July 1, 2023, and concluded that the reporting unit fair values for all reporting units exceeded their carrying values. No impairment existed as of that date and no subsequent impairment indicators have been identified.\nThe following is a progression of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.\n(In millions)\nLife\nSciences\nPersonal Care (a)\nSpecialty\nAdditives (a)\nIntermediates (a)\nTotal\nBalance at September 30, 2021\n$\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n1,430\nCurrency translation and other\n(69\n)\n(11\n)\n(38\n)\n-\n(118\n)\nBalance at September 30, 2022\n-\n1,312\nCurrency translation and other\n-\nBalance at September 30, 2023\n$\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n1,362\n(a)As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, there were accumulated impairments of $356 million, $174 million, and $90 million related to the Personal Care, Specialty Additives, and Intermediates reportable segments, respectively.\nOther intangible assets\nIntangible assets principally consist of trademarks and trade names, intellectual property and customer and supplier relationships. Intangible assets classified as finite are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The cost of trademarks and trade names is amortized principally over 3 to 20 years, intellectual property over 3 to 20 years, and customer and supplier relationships over 10 to 24 years.\nAshland performed its annual impairment test for other indefinite lived intangible assets using the quantitative approach as of July 1, 2023 and concluded that the assets fair values exceeded their carrying values. No impairment existed as of that date.\nOther intangible assets were comprised of the following as of September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nGross\nNet\nGross\nNet\ncarrying\nAccumulated\ncarrying\ncarrying\nAccumulated\ncarrying\n(In millions)\namount\namortization\namount\namount\namortization\namount\nDefinite-lived intangible assets\nTrademarks and trade names\n$\n$\n(43\n)\n$\n$\n$\n(37\n)\n$\nIntellectual property\n(581\n)\n(523\n)\nCustomer and supplier relationships\n(417\n)\n(369\n)\nTotal definite-lived intangible assets\n1,649\n(1,041\n)\n1,614\n(929\n)\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets\nTrademarks and trade names\n-\n-\nTotal intangible assets\n$\n1,927\n$\n(1,041\n)\n$\n$\n1,892\n$\n(929\n)\n$\nAmortization expense recognized on intangible assets was $93 million for 2023, $94 million for 2022 and $90 million for 2021, and is included in the intangibles amortization expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). As of September 30, 2023, all of Ashlands intangible assets that had a carrying value were being amortized except for certain trademarks and trade names that have been determined to have indefinite lives. Estimated amortization expense for future periods is $80 million in 2024, $76 million in 2025, $74 million in 2026, $52 million in 2027 and $50 million in 2028. The amortization expense for future periods is an estimate. Actual amounts may change from such estimated amounts due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, additional intangible asset acquisitions and divestitures, potential impairment, accelerated amortization, or other events.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible assets\nAshlands assessment of an impairment on any of these assets classified currently as having indefinite lives, including goodwill, could change in future periods if significant events happen and/or circumstances change that effect the previously mentioned assumptions such as: a significant change in projected business results, a divestiture decision, increase in Ashlands weighted-average cost of capital rates, decrease in growth rates or assumptions, economic deterioration that is more severe or of a longer duration than anticipated, or another significant economic event.\nNOTE H - DEBT\nThe following table summarizes Ashlands current and long-term debt at September 30, 2023 and 2022.\n(In millions)\n3.375% Senior Notes, due 2031\n$\n$\n2.00% Senior Notes, due 2028 (Euro 500 million principal)\n6.875% notes, due 2043\n6.50% junior subordinated notes, due 2029\nOther (a)\n(11\n)\nTotal debt\n1,330\n1,270\nShort-term debt\n-\nLong-term debt (less debt issuance costs)\n$\n1,314\n$\n1,270\n(a)Other includes $13 million and $14 million of debt issuance costs as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The current portion of the long-term debt was zero for both September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nAt September 30, 2023, Ashlands total debt had an outstanding principal balance of $1,376 million, discounts of $33 million and debt issuance costs of $13 million. As of September 30, 2023, Ashland had no long-term debt (excluding debt issuance costs) maturing within the next 3 years, $4 million due in fiscal 2027 and $528 million in 2028.\nCredit Agreements and Refinancing\nNote Issuances\nDuring August 2021, Ashland, through one of its subsidiaries, completed the issuance of 3.375% senior unsecured notes due 2031 with an aggregate principal amount of $450 million (the 2031 Notes). The notes are guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Ashland. Ashland used the net proceeds of the offering (after deducting initial purchasers' discounts and other fees and expenses) to redeem its obligations under the existing 4.750% senior notes due 2022 described below in debt repayments, and to pay fees and expenses associated therewith.\nAshland incurred $6 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the 2031 Notes, which is amortized using the effective interest method over the 2031 Notes' term and was included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) during 2021.\n2022 Credit Agreement\nDuring July 2022, Ashland, through two of its subsidiaries, enacted an amendment to the 2020 credit agreement. The amended credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement) provides for a $600 million five-year revolving credit facility (the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility). The 2022 Credit Agreement and the obligations of Ashland Services B.V. under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by Ashland.\nAt Ashlands option, loans issued under the 2022 Credit Agreement will bear interest at (a) in the case of loans denominated in U.S. dollars, either Term SOFR or an alternate base rate and (b) in the case of loans denominated in Euros, EURIBOR, in each case plus the applicable interest rate margin. Loans will initially bear interest at Term SOFR or EURIBOR plus 1.250% per annum, in the case of Term SOFR borrowings or EURIBOR borrowings, respectively, or at the alternate base rate plus 0.250% per annum, in the case of alternate base rate borrowings, through and including the date of delivery of a quarterly compliance certificate and thereafter the interest rate will fluctuate between Term SOFR or EURIBOR plus 1.250% per annum and Term SOFR or EURIBOR plus 1.750% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 0.250% per annum and the alternate base rate plus 0.750% per annum), based upon the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) at such time. Term SOFR borrowings are subject to a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% per annum. In addition, the Company will initially be required to pay fees of 0.125% per annum on the daily unused amount of the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility through and including the date of delivery of a quarterly compliance certificate, and thereafter the fee rate will fluctuate between 0.125% and\n0.275% per annum, based upon the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio. Borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement may be prepaid at any time without premiums.\nAs a result of the amendment of the 2020 Credit Agreement, Ashland recognized a $1 million charge for accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2022, which is included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). Ashland also incurred $2 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the 2022 Credit Agreement, of which $1 million was expensed immediately during 2022 within the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). The remaining balance is amortized using the straight-line method.\nThe 2022 Credit Agreement contains financial covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios akin to those in effect under the 2020 Credit Agreement. The 2022 Credit Agreement contains usual and customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios, limitations on liens, additional indebtedness, further negative pledges, investments, mergers, sale of assets and restricted payments, and other customary limitations.\nDebt repayments and repurchases\nCash repatriation\nDuring 2023 and 2022, Ashland repatriated approximately $92 million and $250 million, respectively, in cash. In 2022 the repatriation was primarily used to repay existing debt, principally the prepayment of the Term loan A in 2022.\n2022 Debt repayments and repurchases\n2020 Credit Agreement\nDuring 2022, Ashland prepaid its Term loan A principal balance of $250 million.\nOther Debt\nDuring 2022, Ashland repaid the outstanding balance on its European short-term loan facility for $23 million.\n2021 Debt repayments and repurchases\nRedemption of 4.750% senior notes due 2022\nDuring 2021, Ashland redeemed all of its outstanding 4.750% senior notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes), of which approximately $411 million were outstanding. Ashland recognized a $1 million charge related to accelerated accretion on debt discounts and accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs, which is included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nTotal premiums paid for all the tender offers in 2021 noted above were $16 million, which is included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nAccounts receivable facilities and off-balance sheet arrangements\nU.S. accounts receivable sales program\nOn March 17, 2021, a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity and consolidated Ashland subsidiary (SPE) entered into an agreement with a group of entities (buyers) to sell certain trade receivables, without recourse beyond the pledged receivables, of two other U.S. based Ashland subsidiaries. Under the agreement, Ashland can transfer whole receivables up to a limit established by the buyer, which was set at $125 million between February and October of each year and up to $100 million all other times. Ashlands continuing involvement is limited to servicing the receivables, including billing, collections and remittance of payments to the buyers as well as a limited guarantee on over-collateralization. The arrangement was set to terminate on May 31, 2023.\nOn April 14, 2023, Ashland entered into Second and Third Amendments associated with this current program. As part of this amendment the buyer's limit was reduced to $115 million between April and October of each year, and up to $100 million at all other times. Additionally, the scheduled termination date was extended from May 31, 2023 to April 14, 2025.\nAshland determined that any receivables transferred under this agreement are put presumptively beyond the reach of Ashland and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. Ashland received a true sale at law and non-consolidation opinions to support the legal\nisolation of these receivables. Ashland accounts for the receivables transferred to buyers as sales. Ashland recognizes any gains or losses based on the excess of proceeds received net of buyers discounts and fees compared to the carrying value of the assets. Proceeds received, net of buyers discounts and fees, are recorded within the operating activities of the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. Losses on sale of assets, including related transaction expenses are recorded within the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). Ashland regularly assesses its servicing obligations and records them as assets or liabilities when appropriate. Ashland also monitors its obligation with regards to the limited guarantee and records the resulting guarantee liability when warranted. When applicable, Ashland discloses the amount of the receivable that serves as over-collateralization as a restricted asset.\nAshland recognized a $3 million and $1 million loss within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for 2023 and 2022, respectively, within the net interest and other expense caption associated with sales under the program. Ashland has recorded $86 million of sales against the buyers limit, which was $115 million at September 30, 2023, compared to $110 million of sales against the buyer's limit, which was $125 million at September 30, 2022. Ashland transferred $106 million and $136 million in receivables to the SPE as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Ashland recorded liabilities related to its service obligations and limited guarantee as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 of less than $1 million. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the year-to-date gross cash proceeds received for receivables transferred and derecognized were $217 million and $312 million, respectively, of which $241 million and $315 million were collected by Ashland in our capacity as a servicer of the receivables and remitted to the buyer. The difference between receivables transferred and derecognized versus collected of $24 million and $3 million for the periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, represents the impact of a net reduction in account receivable sales volume during each year. The prior year period included the impact of a $21 million net reduction in accounts receivables sales volume attributable to the Adhesives business sold in 2022.\n2018 foreign accounts receivable securitization\nDuring July 2018, Ashland entered into a \u20ac115 million accounts receivable securitization facility (the Program) for the transfer by certain subsidiaries of Ashland (the Sellers) directly or indirectly to Ester Finance Titrisation (the Purchaser), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (the Arranger), of certain receivables and/or collections originated by the Sellers towards certain corporate debtors located in multiple European jurisdictions and denominated in multiple currencies. The Program originally had a term of two years, but was extended to August 2021 in September 2019. During July 2021, the termination date of the Program was extended to July 2023. During July 2020, the available funding for qualified receivables under the accounts receivable securitization facility decreased from \u20ac115 million to \u20ac100 million. The program was extended on July 12, 2023 to September 30, 2023.\nUnder the Program, each Seller assigns, on an ongoing basis, certain of its accounts receivable and the right to the collections on those accounts receivable to the Purchaser. Under the terms of the Program, the Sellers could, from time to time, obtain up to \u20ac100 million from the Purchaser through the sale of an undivided interest in such accounts receivable and collections. Ashland accounts for the securitization facility as secured borrowings, and the receivables sold pursuant to the facility are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts receivable. Fundings under the Program will be repaid as accounts receivable are collected, with new fundings being advanced (through daily advanced purchase price) as new accounts receivable are originated by the Sellers and assigned to the Purchaser, with settlement occurring monthly. Ashland classifies any borrowings under this facility as a short-term debt instrument within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Once sold to the Purchaser, the accounts receivable and rights to collection described above are separate and distinct from each Sellers own assets and are not available to its creditors should such Sellers become insolvent.\nAt September 30, 2023 and 2022, the outstanding amounts of accounts receivable transferred by Ashland to the Purchaser were $124 million and $162 million, respectively and there were no borrowings (denominated in multiple currencies) under the facility for either period. The weighted-average interest rate for this instrument was 0.5% for 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOther debt\nAt September 30, 2023 and 2022, Ashland held other debt totaling $83 million and $63 million, respectively, comprised primarily of the 6.50% notes due 2029 and other notes.\nCovenants related to current Ashland debt agreements\nAshlands debt contains usual and customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios, limitations on liens, additional subsidiary indebtedness, restrictions on subsidiary\ndistributions, investments, mergers, sale of assets and restricted payments and other customary limitations. As of September 30, 2023, Ashland was in compliance with all debt agreement covenant restrictions.\nThe maximum consolidated net leverage ratio permitted under Ashlands most recent credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement) is 4.0. The 2022 Credit Agreement defines the consolidated net leverage ratio as the ratio of consolidated indebtedness minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to consolidated EBITDA (Covenant Adjusted EBITDA) for any measurement period. In general, the 2022 Credit Agreement defines Covenant Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus consolidated interest charges, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, fees and expenses related to capital market transactions and proposed or actual acquisitions and divestitures, restructuring and integration charges, certain environmental charges, non-cash stock and equity compensation expense, and any other nonrecurring expenses or losses that do not represent a cash item in such period or any future period; less any non-cash gains or other items increasing net income. In general, consolidated indebtedness includes debt plus all purchase money indebtedness, bankers acceptances and bank guaranties, deferred purchase price of property or services, attributable indebtedness and guarantees. At September 30, 2023, Ashlands calculation of the consolidated net leverage ratio was 1.9.\nThe minimum required consolidated interest coverage ratio under the 2022 Credit Agreement is 3.0. The 2022 Credit Agreement defines the consolidated interest coverage ratio as the ratio of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest charges for any measurement period. At September 30, 2023, Ashlands calculation of the consolidated interest coverage ratio was 8.6.\nNet interest and other expense (income)\n(In millions)\nInterest expense (a)\n$\n$\n$\nInterest income\n(12\n)\n(4\n)\n(1\n)\nLoss on the accounts receivables sale program\nInvestment securities loss (income) (b)\n(42\n)\n(33\n)\nOther financing costs (c)\n$\n$\n$\n(a)Includes $1 million and $1 million of accelerated accretion and/or amortization for original issue discounts and debt issuance costs during 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(b)Represents investment loss (income) related to the restricted investments discussed in Note E.\n(c)Includes costs of $16 million related to early redemption premium payments for the 2022 notes during 2021.\nThe following table details the debt issuance cost and original issue discount amortization included in interest expense during 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n(In millions)\nNormal amortization\n$\n$\n$\nAccelerated amortization (a)\n-\nTotal\n$\n$\n$\n(a)Fiscal year 2022 includes $1 million of accelerated debt issuance costs for the 2020 credit agreement. 2021 includes $1 million of accelerated debt issuance cost for the 2022 Notes.\nNOTE I - OTHER NONCURRENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nThe following table provides the components of other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30.\n(In millions)\nDeferred compensation investments\n$\n$\nTax and tax indemnity receivables\nLife insurance policies\nManufacturing catalyst supplies\nDefined benefit plan assets\nEquity and other unconsolidated investments\nLand use rights\nEnvironmental insurance receivables\nDebt issuance costs\nOther\n$\n$\nDeferred compensation investments\nDeferred compensation investments consist of insurance policies valued at cash surrender value. Gains and losses related to deferred compensation investments are immediately recognized within the selling, general and administrative expense caption on the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). These investments had gains of $5 million during 2023, losses of $2 million during 2022, and gains of $10 million during 2021. During 2021, Ashland liquidated $90 million of deferred compensation investments to fund the Environmental trust. These cash inflows exclude company-owned life insurance death benefits of $6 million, $3 million and $1 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note A for additional details.\nThe following table provides the components of other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30.\n(In millions)\nTax liabilities\n$\n$\nEnvironmental remediation reserves\nDeferred compensation\nOther\n$\n$\nNOTE J - LEASING ARRANGEMENTS\nAshland leases certain office buildings, transportation equipment, warehouses and storage facilities, and equipment. Substantially all of Ashlands leases are operating leases or short-term leases. Real estate leases represented over 85% of the total lease liability at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note A for additional information related to Ashlands leasing policies.\nThe components of lease cost recognized within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) were as follows:\n(In millions)\nLocation\nLease cost:\nOperating lease cost\nSelling, General & Administrative\n$\n$\n$\nOperating lease cost\nCost of Sales\nVariable lease cost\nSelling, General & Administrative\nVariable lease cost\nCost of Sales\nShort-term leases\nCost of Sales\nTotal lease cost (a)\n$\n$\n$\n(a)Includes $2 million lease termination fee in fiscal 2022.\nThe following table summarizes Ashlands lease assets and liabilities as presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30:\n(In millions)\nAssets\nOperating lease assets, net\n$\n$\nTotal lease assets\n$\n$\nLiabilities\nCurrent operating lease obligations\n$\n$\nNon-current operating lease obligations\nTotal lease liabilities\n$\n$\nAshland often has options to renew lease terms for buildings and other assets. The exercise of lease renewal options are generally at Ashland's sole discretion. In addition, certain lease arrangements may be terminated prior to their original expiration date at Ashland's discretion. Ashland evaluates renewal and termination options at the lease commencement date to determine if it is reasonably certain to exercise the option on the basis of economic factors. The weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 was approximately 17 years in both periods.\nResidual value guarantees are not common within Ashland's lease agreements nor are restrictions or covenants imposed by leases. Ashland has elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components. The discount rate implicit within the leases is generally not determinable. Therefore, Ashland determines the discount rate based on its incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using a buildup method resulting in an estimated range of secured borrowing rates matching the lease term and the currency of the jurisdiction in which lease payments are made, adjusted for impacts of collateral. Consideration was given to Ashlands own relevant debt issuances as well as debt instruments of comparable companies with similar credit characteristics. The weighted average discount rate used to measure operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 was 3.5% and 2.6%, respectively. There are no leases that have not yet commenced but that create significant rights and obligations for Ashland.\nRight-of-use assets exchanged for new operating lease obligations was $32 million and $14 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table provides cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities for during 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n(In millions)\nOperating cash flows from operating leases\n$\n$\n$\nThe following table summarizes Ashland's maturities of lease liabilities as of September 30, 2023:\n(In millions)\n$\nThereafter\nTotal lease payments\nLess amount of lease payment representing interest\n(39\n)\nTotal present value of lease payments\n$\nNOTE K - INCOME TAXES\nIncome Tax Provision\nA summary of the provision for income taxes related to continuing operations follows.\n(In millions)\nCurrent\nFederal\n$\n(17\n)\n$\n$\n(35\n)\nState\n(5\n)\n(2\n)\nForeign\n(12\n)\nDeferred\n(32\n)\n(35\n)\n(26\n)\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n$\n(8\n)\n$\n$\n(38\n)\nTemporary differences that give rise to significant deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30 are presented in the following table.\n(In millions)\nDeferred tax assets\nForeign net operating loss carryforwards (a)\n$\n$\nEmployee benefit obligations\nEnvironmental, self-insurance and litigation reserves (net of receivables)\nState net operating loss carryforwards (net of unrecognized tax benefits) (b)\nCompensation accruals\nCredit carryforwards (net of unrecognized tax benefits) (c)\nOther items\nOther lease liability\nValuation allowances (d)\n(56\n)\n(56\n)\nTotal deferred tax assets\nDeferred tax liabilities\nGoodwill and other intangibles (e)\nProperty, plant and equipment\nRight of use assets\nOther\n-\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\nNet deferred tax liability\n$\n(126\n)\n$\n(156\n)\n(a)Gross net operating loss carryforwards of $99 million will expire in future years beyond 2024 or have no expiration, and primarily relate to European and Asian subsidiaries.\n(b)Apportioned net operating loss carryforwards generated of $462 million will expire in future years as follows: $78 million in 2024, $56 million in 2025 and the remaining balance in other future years.\n(c)Credit carryforwards consist primarily of foreign tax credits of $17 million expiring in future years, and state tax credits of $1 million that will expire in 2026 and other future years.\n(d)Valuation allowances primarily relate to certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and certain federal credit carryforwards.\n(e)The total gross amount of goodwill as of September 30, 2023 expected to be deductible for tax purposes is $42 million.\nThe U.S. and foreign components of income from continuing operations before income taxes and a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax with the provision for income taxes follow.

The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step requires Ashland to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. The second step requires Ashland to recognize in the financial statements each tax position that meets the more likely than not criteria, measured at the amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. Ashland had $59 million and $84 million of unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, recorded within other noncurrent liabilities. As of September 30, 2023, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the tax rate for continuing and discontinued operations was $48 million. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions for which ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty as to the timing of such deductibility. Recognition of these tax benefits would not have an impact on the effective tax rate.\nAshland recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense (benefit) in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). Such interest and penalties totaled a $1 million benefit in 2023, $3 million expense in 2022 and $15 million benefit in 2021. Ashland had $10 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nChanges in unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:\n(In millions)\nBalance at September 30, 2021\n$\nDecreases related to positions taken on items from prior years\n(5\n)\nIncreases related to positions taken in the current year\nLapse of statute of limitations\n(12\n)\nBalance at September 30, 2022\n$\nDecreases related to positions taken on items from prior years\n(30\n)\nIncreases related to positions taken in the current year\nIncreases related to positions taken in the prior year\nLapse of statute of limitations\n(4\n)\nBalance at September 30, 2023\n$\nFrom a combination of statute expirations and audit settlements in the next twelve months, Ashland expects a decrease in the amount of accrual for uncertain tax positions of between $3 million and $5 million for continuing operations. For the remaining balance as of September 30, 2023, it is reasonably possible that there could be material changes to the amount of uncertain tax positions due to activities of the taxing authorities, settlement of audit issues, reassessment of existing uncertain tax positions or the expiration of applicable statute of limitations; however, Ashland is not able to estimate the impact of these items at this time.\nAshland or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Foreign taxing jurisdictions significant to Ashland include Belgium, Brazil, China, Germany, Mexico, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Ashland is subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for periods after September 30, 2019 and U.S. state income tax examinations by tax authorities for periods after September 30, 2017. With respect to countries outside of the United States, with certain exceptions, Ashlands foreign subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits for years after 2017.\nNOTE L - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nPension plans\nAshland and its subsidiaries have several contributory and noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plans that generally cover international employees and a small portion of certain U.S. manufacturing union employees. Pension obligations for applicable employees of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries are provided for in accordance with local practices and regulations of the respective countries. The majority of these foreign pension plans are closed to new participants while those that remain open relate to areas where jurisdictions require plans to operate within the applicable country.\nBenefits for those eligible for Ashlands U.S. pension plans generally are based on employees years of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding their retirement. The remaining U.S. plans are still open for enrollment for qualifying union employees within certain manufacturing sites.\nOther postretirement benefit plans\nAshland and its subsidiaries maintain limited health care for certain eligible employees in the U.S. who are retired or disabled. Ashland shares the costs of providing health care coverage with certain eligible retired employees through premiums, deductibles and coinsurance provisions. Ashland funds its share of the costs of the postretirement benefit plans as the benefits are paid.\nPostretirement health care plans include a limit on Ashlands share of costs for recent and future retirees. The assumed pre-65 health care cost increase trend rate as of September 30, 2023 was 6.6% and continues to be reduced to 4.5% in 2040 and thereafter. The assumptions used to project the liability anticipate future cost-sharing changes to the written plans that are consistent with the increase in health care costs.\nPlan Amendments and Remeasurements\nFollowing the completion of the sale of its Performance Adhesives business segment on February 28, 2022, the post-retirement benefits for approximately 40 employees transferred to Arkema, all of whom participated in a non-contributory defined benefit plan in the U.S., were frozen. This resulted in a decrease in total expected future years of service within the plan and required Ashland to remeasure the plan as February 28, 2022. As a result, Ashland recorded a $1 million actuarial gain within the other net periodic benefit loss (income) caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for fiscal 2022.\nNet periodic benefit loss (income) allocation\nConsistent with Ashlands historical accounting policies, service cost for continuing operations is allocated to each reportable segment, excluding the Unallocated and other segment, while all other costs for continuing operations are recorded within the Unallocated and other segment.\nThe following table summarizes the components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs for continuing operations and the assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit loss (income) for the plans.\nPension benefits\nOther postretirement benefits\n(In millions)\nNet periodic benefit loss (income)\nService cost (a)\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nInterest cost (b)\nCurtailment, settlement and other (b)\n-\n(1\n)\n-\n-\n-\n-\nExpected return on plan assets (b)\n(7\n)\n(7\n)\n(8\n)\n-\n-\n-\nActuarial (gain) loss (b)\n-\n(16\n)\n(2\n)\n(8\n)\n(2\n)\n$\n$\n(12\n)\n$\n$\n$\n(5\n)\n$\nWeighted-average plan assumptions (c)\nDiscount rate for service cost\n4.56\n%\n2.99\n%\n1.81\n%\n5.80\n%\n3.19\n%\n3.15\n%\nDiscount rate for interest cost\n5.44\n%\n3.33\n%\n1.69\n%\n5.54\n%\n2.10\n%\n1.93\n%\nRate of compensation increase\n3.07\n%\n2.50\n%\n2.53\n%\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets\n4.25\n%\n2.89\n%\n2.43\n%\n(a)Service cost is classified within the selling, general and administrative expense and cost of sales captions on the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n(b)These components are classified within the other net periodic benefit loss (income) caption on the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n(c)The plan assumptions discussed are a blended weighted-average rate for Ashlands U.S. and non-U.S. plans.\nThe changes in prior service credit recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income during both 2023 and 2022 were less than $1 million each. At September 30, 2023, Ashland expects to recognize less than $1 million of the prior service credit in accumulated other comprehensive income as net periodic benefit loss (income) during the next fiscal year.\nAt September 30, 2023 and 2022, the amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income are shown in the following table.\nPension\nPostretirement\n(In millions)\nPrior service cost\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\nObligations and funded status\nActuarial valuations are performed for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans to determine Ashlands obligation for each plan.

Information for pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets follows:\n(In millions)\nProjected benefit obligation\n$\n$\nAccumulated benefit obligation\nFair value of plan assets\nPlan assets\nThe expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was 4.25% and 2.89% for September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The basis for determining the expected long-term rate of return is a combination of future return assumptions for various asset classes in Ashlands investment portfolio, historical analysis of previous returns, market indices and a projection of inflation.\nThe following table summarizes the various investment categories that the pension plan assets are invested in and the applicable fair value hierarchy that the financial instruments are classified within these investment categories as of September 30, 2023.

Investments classified as a Level 1 fair value measure principally represent marketable securities priced in active markets. Cash and cash equivalents and public equity and debt securities are well diversified and invested in U.S. and international small-to-large companies across various asset managers and styles. Investments classified as a Level 2 fair value measure principally represents fixed-income securities and other investment grade corporate bonds and debt obligations.\nInvestments and Strategy\nIn developing an investment strategy for its defined benefit plans, Ashland has considered the following factors: the nature of the plans liabilities, the allocation of liabilities between active, deferred and retired members, the funded status of the plans, the applicable investment horizon, the respective size of the plans and historical and expected capital market returns. Ashlands U.S. pension plan assets are managed by outside investment managers, which are monitored against investment return benchmarks and Ashlands established investment strategy. Investment managers are selected based on an analysis of, among other things, their investment process, historical investment results, frequency of management turnover, cost structure and assets under management. Assets are periodically reallocated between investment managers to maintain an appropriate asset mix and diversification of investments and to optimize returns.\nThe current asset allocation for the U.S. plans is 47.6% fixed income securities, 38.8% equity securities and 13.6% other securities. Fixed income securities primarily include cash and cash equivalents, long duration corporate debt obligations and U.S. government debt obligations. In addition, Ashlands non-U.S. plan fixed income securities include insurance contracts. Equity securities are comprised solely of traditional public equity investments. Investment managers may employ a limited use of derivatives to gain efficient exposure to markets.\nAshlands investment strategy and management practices relative to plan assets of non-U.S. plans generally are consistent with those for U.S. plans, except in those countries where investment of plan assets is dictated by applicable regulations. Although the investment allocation may vary based on funding percentages and whether plans are still accruing additional liabilities, the weighted-average asset allocations for Ashlands U.S. and non-U.S. plans at September 30, 2023 and 2022 by asset category follow.\nActual at September 30\n(In millions)\nTarget\nPlan assets allocation\nEquity securities\n5 - 45%\n%\n%\nFixed income securities\n55 - 95%\n%\n%\nOther\n0 - 5%\n%\n%\n%\n%\nCash flows\nDuring 2023 and 2022, Ashland contributed $3 million and less than $1 million to its U.S. pension plans, respectively, and $5 million in each year to its non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. Ashland expects to contribute approximately $6 million to its U.S. pension plans and expects to contribute approximately $5 million to its non-U.S. pension plans during 2024.\nThe following benefit payments, which reflect future service expectations, are projected to be paid from plan assets in each of the next five years and in aggregate for five years thereafter.\nOther\nPension\npostretirement\n(In millions)\nbenefits\nbenefits\n$\n$\n2029 - 2033\nOther plans\nAshland sponsors savings plans to assist eligible employees in providing for retirement or other future needs. Under such plans, company contributions amounted to $23 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $21 million in 2021. Ashland also sponsors various other employee benefit plans, some of which are required by different countries. The total noncurrent liabilities associated with these plans was $4 million for September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNOTE M - LITIGATION, CLAIMS AND CONTINGENCIES\nAsbestos litigation\nAshland and Hercules have liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. To assist in developing and annually updating independent reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs, Ashland has retained third party actuarial experts Gnarus. The methodology used by Gnarus to project future asbestos costs is based largely on recent experience, including claim-filing and settlement rates, disease mix, open claims and litigation defense. The claim experience of Ashland and Hercules are separately compared to the results of previously conducted third party epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases. Those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population expected to have been exposed to asbestos. Using that information, Gnarus estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed, as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims. Changes in asbestos-related liabilities and receivables are recorded on an after-tax basis within the discontinued operations caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nAshland asbestos-related litigation\nThe claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos asserted against Ashland result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in 1990 in connection with the sale of Riley, a former subsidiary. The amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate from period to period. A summary of Ashland asbestos claims activity, excluding Hercules claims, follows.\n(In thousands)\nOpen claims - beginning of year\nNew claims filed\nClaims settled\n(1\n)\n(1\n)\n(1\n)\nClaims dismissed\n(3\n)\n(3\n)\n(4\n)\nOpen claims - end of year\nAshland asbestos-related liability\nFrom the range of estimates, Ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs. Ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non-inflated, non-discounted approximate 40-year model developed with the assistance of Gnarus.\nDuring the most recent update completed during 2023, it was determined that the liability for Ashland asbestos-related claims should be increased by $9 million. Total reserves for asbestos claims were $281 million at September 30, 2023 compared to $305 million at September 30, 2022.\nA progression of activity in the asbestos reserve is presented in the following table.\n(In millions)\nAsbestos reserve - beginning of year\n$\n$\n$\nReserve adjustment\nAmounts paid\n(33\n)\n(31\n)\n(27\n)\nAsbestos reserve - end of year (a)\n$\n$\n$\n(a)Included $28 million and $29 million classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAshland asbestos-related receivables\nAshland has insurance coverage for certain litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in connection with its asbestos claims, and coverage-in-place agreements exist with the insurance companies that provide substantially all of the coverage that will be accessed.\nFor the Ashland asbestos-related obligations, Ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on managements interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage, including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent. Substantially all of the estimated receivables from insurance companies are expected to be due from domestic insurers, all of which are solvent.\nAt September 30, 2023, Ashlands receivable for recoveries of litigation defense and claim settlement costs from insurers amounted to $95 million (excluding the Hercules receivable for asbestos claims discussed below). Receivables from insurers amounted to $101 million at\nSeptember 30, 2022. During 2023, the annual update of the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers, was completed. This model update resulted in a $3 million increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries.\nA progression of activity in the Ashland insurance receivable is presented in the following table.\n(In millions)\nInsurance receivable - beginning of year\n$\n$\n$\nReceivable adjustment (a)\nInsurance settlement\n-\n-\n-\nAmounts collected\n(9\n)\n(6\n)\n(9\n)\nInsurance receivable - end of year (b)\n$\n$\n$\n(a)2021 includes a $2 million reserve adjustment related to allowances for credit losses as a result of Ashland's adoption of the new credit measurement standard described in Note A.

Such claims typically arise from alleged exposure to asbestos fibers from resin encapsulated pipe and tank products which were sold by one of Hercules former subsidiaries to a limited industrial market. The amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate from period to period. A summary of Hercules asbestos claims activity follows.\n(In thousands)\nOpen claims - beginning of year\nNew claims filed\nClaims dismissed\n-\n(2\n)\n(1\n)\nOpen claims - end of year\nHercules asbestos-related liability\nFrom the range of estimates, Ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs. Ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non-inflated, non-discounted approximate 40-year model developed with the assistance of Gnarus. As a result of the most recent annual update of this estimate, completed during 2023, it was determined that the liability for Hercules asbestos-related claims should be decreased by $2 million. Total reserves for asbestos claims were $191 million at September 30, 2023 compared to $213 million at September 30, 2022.\nA progression of activity in the asbestos reserve is presented in the following table.\n(In millions)\nAsbestos reserve - beginning of year\n$\n$\n$\nReserve adjustments\n(2\n)\nAmounts paid\n(20\n)\n(19\n)\n(20\n)\nAsbestos reserve - end of year (a)\n$\n$\n$\n(a)Included $17 million and $18 million classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nHercules asbestos-related receivables\nFor the Hercules asbestos-related obligations, certain reimbursement obligations pursuant to coverage-in-place agreements with insurance carriers exist. As a result, any increases in the asbestos reserve have been partially offset by probable insurance recoveries. Ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on managements interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage, including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent. The estimated receivable consists exclusively of solvent domestic insurers.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the receivables from insurers amounted to $47 million and $52 million, respectively. During 2023, the annual update of the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers was completed. This model update resulted in a $3 million decrease in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries.\nA progression of activity in the Hercules insurance receivable is presented in the following table.\n(In millions)\nInsurance receivable - beginning of year\n$\n$\n$\nReceivable adjustment (a)\n(3\n)\nAmounts collected\n(2\n)\n(2\n)\n(1\n)\nInsurance receivable - end of year (b)\n$\n$\n$\n(a)2021 includes a $1 million reserve adjustment related to allowances for credit losses as a result of Ashland's adoption of the new credit measurement standard described in Note A. The total allowance for credit losses was $1 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(b)Included $4 million and $3 million classified in accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAsbestos litigation cost projection\nProjecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are difficult to predict. In addition to the uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received, other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant and the related costs incurred in resolving those claims, mortality rates, dismissal rates, uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case. Furthermore, any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. In light of these inherent uncertainties, Ashland believes that the asbestos reserves for Ashland and Hercules represent the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes. As a part of the process to develop these estimates of future asbestos costs, a range of long-term cost models was developed. These models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long-term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs, as well as other variables mentioned previously. Ashland has currently estimated in various models ranging from approximately 40 year periods that it is reasonably possible that total future litigation defense and claim settlement costs on an inflated and undiscounted basis could range as high as approximately $422 million for the Ashland asbestos-related litigation (current reserve of $281 million) and approximately $288 million for the Hercules asbestos-related litigation (current reserve of $191 million), depending on the combination of assumptions selected in the various models. While the timeframe used in Ashland's models for projecting asbestos liabilities generally decreases over time based on the expected lifetime of the liabilities, these models have been consistently applied within all periods presented. If actual experience is worse than projected, relative to the number of claims filed, the severity of alleged disease associated with those claims or costs incurred to resolve those claims, or actuarial refinement or improvements to the assumptions used within these models are initiated, Ashland may need to further increase the estimates of the costs associated with asbestos claims and these increases could be material over time.\nEnvironmental remediation and asset retirement obligations\nAshland is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts (collectively environmental remediation) at multiple locations. At September 30, 2023, such locations included 57 sites where Ashland has been identified as a potentially responsible party under Superfund or similar state laws, 108 current and former operating facilities and about 1,225 service station properties, of which 14 are being actively remediated.\nAshlands reserves for environmental remediation and related environmental litigation amounted to $214 million at September 30, 2023 compared to $211 million at September 30, 2022, of which $165 million at September 30, 2023 and $157 million at September 30, 2022 were classified in other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining reserves were classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the environmental remediation reserves during 2023 and 2022.\n(In millions)\nEnvironmental remediation reserve - beginning of year\n$\n$\nDisbursements\n(54\n)\n(63\n)\nRevised obligation estimates and accretion\nEnvironmental remediation reserve - end of year\n$\n$\nThe total reserves for environmental remediation reflect Ashlands estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable, without regard to any third-party recoveries. Engineering studies, historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation. Ashland regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues. Ashland has estimated the value of its probable insurance recoveries associated with its environmental reserve based on managements interpretations\nand estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, Ashlands recorded receivable for these probable insurance recoveries was $17 million and $21 million, respectively, of which $15 million and $17 million was classified in other noncurrent assets in the respective Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDuring 2023, 2022 and 2021, Ashland recognized $56 million, $66 million and $50 million of expense, respectively, for certain environmental liabilities related to normal ongoing remediation cost estimate updates for sites, which is consistent with Ashlands historical environmental accounting policy.\nComponents of environmental remediation expense included within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) are presented in the following table for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n(In millions)\nEnvironmental expense\n$\n$\n$\nAccretion\nLegal expense\nTotal expense\nInsurance receivable\n(1\n)\n(5\n)\n(4\n)\nTotal expense, net of receivable activity (a)\n$\n$\n$\n(a)Net expense of $5 million, $13 million and $6 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to divested businesses which qualified for treatment as discontinued operations and for which certain environmental liabilities were retained by Ashland. These amounts are classified within the income from discontinued operations caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nEnvironmental remediation reserves are subject to uncertainties that affect Ashlands ability to estimate its share of the costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site and the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of environmental remediation, Ashland currently estimates that the upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for identified sites could be as high as approximately $465 million. The largest reserve for any site is 21% of the remediation reserve.\nBrazil tax credits\nIn March 2017, the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (Brazil Supreme Court) ruled in a leading case that a Brazilian value-added tax (ICMS) should not be included in the base used to calculate a taxpayers federal contribution on total revenue known as PIS/COFINS (2017 Decision). As a result, two of Ashlands Brazilian subsidiaries filed lawsuits challenging the inclusion of ICMS in Ashlands calculation of PIS/COFINs, seeking recovery of excess taxes paid plus interest.\nIn response to the 2017 Decision, the Brazilian tax authority filed an appeal of the 2017 Decision seeking clarification of the amount of ICMS tax to exclude from the calculation of PIS/COFINS. In May 2021, the Brazil Supreme Court ruled that the ICMS tax be excluded from the calculation of PIS/COFINS. In May 2023, Law 14592/23 was passed in Brazil, converting the 2017 Decision provisional measure effective for PIS/COFINS legislation excluding ICMS from the calculation basis.\nAs of September 30, 2023, Ashland had received all favorable court rulings for previously filed suits, completed its analysis of certain prior year overpayments related to ICMS and received acknowledgment from the Brazilian tax authority that allows Ashland to begin the process to recover the taxes. As a result, Ashland recorded a pre-tax gain of $12 million for period ended September 30, 2023 for certain excess PIS/COFINS paid from 2012 to February 2023 plus interest. The gain was recognized within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). Ashland plans to start utilizing these credits in December 2023.\nOther legal proceedings and claims\nIn addition to the matters described above, there are other various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings pending or threatened against Ashland and its current and former subsidiaries. Such actions are with respect to commercial matters, product liability, toxic tort liability, and other environmental matters, which seek remedies or damages, some of which are for substantial amounts. While Ashland cannot predict with certainty the outcome of such actions, it believes that adequate reserves have been recorded and losses already recognized with respect to such actions were immaterial as of September 30, 2023 and 2022. There is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already\nrecognized may be incurred related to these actions; however, Ashland believes that such potential losses were immaterial as of September 30, 2023.\nNOTE N - EQUITY ITEMS\nStock repurchase programs\nOn June 28, 2023, Ashland's board of directors authorized a new evergreen $1 billion common share repurchase program (2023 stock repurchase program). The new authorization terminates and replaces the company's 2022 stock repurchase program, which had $200 million outstanding at the date of termination. In 2022, the 2022 stock repurchase program replaced and terminated the 2018 $1 billion share repurchase program, which had $150 million outstanding at its date of termination on May 22, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, $1 billion remained available for repurchase under the 2023 stock repurchase program.\nStock repurchase program agreements\nDuring May 2023, under the 2022 stock repurchase program, Ashland initiated a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan agreement to repurchase up to $100 million of its outstanding shares. The program was completed during June 2023, when Ashland paid a total of $100 million and received a delivery of 1.1 million shares of common stock.\nDuring March 2023, under the 2022 stock repurchase program, Ashland initiated a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan agreement to repurchase up to $100 million of its outstanding shares. The program was completed during April 2023, when Ashland paid a total of $100 million and received a delivery of 1.0 million shares of common stock.\nDuring February 2023, under the 2022 stock repurchase program, Ashland initiated a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan agreement to repurchase up to $100 million of its outstanding shares. The program was completed during February 2023, when Ashland paid a total of $100 million and received a delivery of 1.0 million shares of common stock.\nOn March 1, 2022, under the 2018 stock repurchase program, Ashland entered into an agreement to repurchase an aggregate amount of $200 million of Ashland common stock using open-market purchases under rule 10b-18. On April 8, 2022, Ashland completed repurchases under this agreement repurchasing a total of 2.15 million shares for a total amount of $200 million.\nIn September 2021, under the 2018 stock repurchase program, Ashland announced that it entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (2021 ASR Agreement). Under the 2021 ASR Agreement, Ashland paid an initial purchase price of $450 million and received an initial delivery of 3.9 million shares of common stock during September 2021. The bank exercised its early termination option under the 2021 ASR Agreement in February 2022, and an additional 0.7 million shares were repurchased, bringing the total shares repurchased upon settlement to 4.6 million.\nStockholder dividends\nAshland paid dividends per common share of $1.44, $1.27 and $1.15 during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIn May 2023, the Board of Directors of Ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend of 38.5 cents per share to eligible stockholders at record, which represented an increase from the previous quarterly cash dividend of 33.5 cents per share. The dividend was paid in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\nIn May 2022, the Board of Directors of Ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend of 33.5 cents per share to eligible stockholders at record, which represented an increase from the previous quarterly cash dividend of 30.0 cents per share. This dividend was paid in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022 and the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023.\nIn May 2021, the Board of Directors of Ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend of 30.0 cents per share to eligible stockholders at record, which represented an increase from the previous quarterly cash dividend of 27.5 cents per share. This dividend was paid in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021 and the first and second quarters of fiscal 2022.\nIn May 2019, the Board of Directors of Ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend of 27.5 cents per share to eligible stockholders at record, which represented an increase from the previous quarterly cash dividend of 25.0 cents per share. This dividend was paid in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2021.\nShares reserved for issuance\nAt September 30, 2023, 17.3 million common shares were reserved for issuance under stock incentive and deferred compensation plans.\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nComponents of other comprehensive income (loss) recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) are presented in the following table, before tax and net of tax effects.\nTax\nBefore\n(expense)\nNet of\n(In millions)\ntax\nbenefit\ntax\nYear ended September 30, 2023\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nUnrealized translation gain\n$\n$\n-\n$\nUnrealized loss on commodity hedges\n(8\n)\n(6\n)\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss)\n$\n$\n$\nYear ended September 30, 2022\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nUnrealized translation loss\n$\n(199\n)\n$\n$\n(197\n)\nUnrealized loss on commodity hedges\n(2\n)\n(1\n)\nPension and postretirement obligation adjustment\n-\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss)\n$\n(200\n)\n$\n$\n(197\n)\nYear ended September 30, 2021\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nUnrealized translation gain\n$\n$\n(1\n)\n$\nUnrealized gain on commodity hedges\n(1\n)\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss)\n$\n$\n(2\n)\n$\nSummary of Stockholders Equity\nA reconciliation of changes in stockholders equity are as follows:\n(In millions)\nCommon stock and paid in capital\nBalance, beginning of period\n$\n$\n$\nCommon shares issued under stock incentive and other plans (a)\nCommon shares purchased under repurchase program (b) (c)\n(143\n)\n(200\n)\n(450\n)\nBalance, end of period\nRetained earnings\nBalance, beginning of period\n3,653\n2,796\n2,649\nAdoption of new accounting pronouncements (d)\n-\n-\n(2\n)\nCommon shares purchased under repurchase program (b)\n(160\n)\n-\n-\nNet income\nRegular dividends\n(76\n)\n(70\n)\n(71\n)\nBalance, end of period\n3,595\n3,653\n2,796\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nBalance, beginning of period\n(569\n)\n(372\n)\n(383\n)\nUnrealized translation gain (loss)\n(197\n)\nUnrealized gain (loss) on commodity hedges\n(6\n)\n(1\n)\nPension and postretirement obligation adjustment\n-\n-\nBalance, end of period\n(503\n)\n(569\n)\n(372\n)\nTotal stockholders' equity\n$\n3,097\n$\n3,220\n$\n2,752\nCash dividends declared per common share\n$\n1.44\n$\n1.27\n$\n1.15\n(a)Common shares issued were 193,767, 168,270 and 183,281 for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(b)Common shares repurchased were 3,082,928, 2,853,312 and 3,922,423 for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(c)Includes $3 million in excise tax on stock repurchases for 2023.\n(d)Represents the cumulative-effect adjustment related to the adoption of the new guidance related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments during fiscal 2021. See Note A for more information.\nNOTE O - STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS\nAshland has stock incentive plans under which key employees or directors are granted performance share awards or nonvested stock awards. Each program is typically a long-term incentive plan designed to link employee compensation with increased shareholder value or reward superior performance and encourage continued employment with Ashland. Ashland recognizes compensation expense for the grant date fair value of stock-based awards over the requisite service period and accounts for forfeitures when they occur across all stock-based awards.\nThe components of Ashland's pretax compensation expense for stock-based awards (net of forfeitures) and associated income tax benefits are as follows.\n(In millions)\n2023 (a)\n2022 (b)\n2021 (c)\nSARs\n$\n-\n$\n$\nNonvested stock awards\nPerformance share awards\n$\n$\n$\nIncome tax benefit\n$\n$\n$\n(a)The year ended September 30, 2023 included $1 million of expense and $1 million of income related to cash-settled nonvested restricted stock awards and cash-settled performance units, respectively.\n(b)The year ended September 30, 2022 included $4 million and $2 million of expense related to cash-settled nonvested restricted stock awards and cash-settled performance units, respectively.\n(c)The year ended September 30, 2021 included $3 million and zero of expense related to cash-settled nonvested restricted stock awards and cash-settled performance units, respectively.\nStock Appreciation Rights\nSARs were granted to employees or directors at a price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and typically become exercisable over periods of one to three years. Unexercised SARs lapse ten years after the date of grant. Ashland estimated the fair value of SARs granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Ashland has not granted any SARs since August 2020.\nA progression of activity and various other information relative to SARs and previously issued and vested stock options is presented in the following table.\nNumber\nWeighted-\nNumber\nWeighted-\nNumber\nWeighted-\nof\naverage\nof\naverage\nof\naverage\n(In thousands except per\ncommon\nexercise price\ncommon\nexercise price\ncommon\nexercise price\nshare data)\nshares\nper share\nshares\nper share\nshares\nper share\nOutstanding - beginning of year\n1,142\n$\n63.85\n1,543\n$\n62.14\n1,993\n$\n61.11\nExercised\n(114\n)\n52.31\n(392\n)\n57.32\n(386\n)\n54.44\nForfeitures and expirations\n(5\n)\n46.67\n(9\n)\n54.70\n(64\n)\n77.17\nOutstanding - end of year (a)\n1,023\n65.22\n1,142\n63.85\n1,543\n62.14\nExercisable - end of year\n1,023\n65.22\n1,094\n63.24\n1,415\n60.68\n(a)Exercise prices per share for SARs outstanding at September 30, 2023 ranged from $47.63 to $59.95 for 521 thousand shares and from $67.16 to $82.34 for 502 thousand shares. The weighted-average remaining contractual life of outstanding and exercisable SARs and stock options was 3.7 years.\nThe total intrinsic value of SARs exercised was $6 million in 2023, $19 million in 2022 and $12 million in 2021. The actual tax benefit realized from the exercised SARs was $1 million in 2023, $4 million in 2022 and $3 million in 2021. The total grant date fair value of SARs that vested during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $1 million each year. As of September 30, 2023, there was zero unrecognized compensation costs related to SARs. As of September 30, 2023, the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding and exercisable SARs was $17 million.\nNonvested stock awards\nNonvested stock awards are granted to employees or directors at a price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and generally vest over a one-to-three-year period. However, such shares or units are subject to forfeiture upon termination of service before the vesting period ends. Beginning in 2016, these awards were primarily granted as stock units that will convert to shares upon vesting, while the grants in prior years were generally made in nonvested shares. Only nonvested stock awards granted in the form of shares entitle employees or directors to vote the shares. Dividends on nonvested stock awards granted are in the form of additional units or shares of nonvested stock awards, which are subject to vesting and forfeiture provisions.\nA progression of activity and various other information relative to nonvested stock awards is presented in the following table.\nNumber\nWeighted-\nNumber\nWeighted-\nNumber\nWeighted-\nof\naverage\nof\naverage\nof\naverage\n(In thousands except per\ncommon\ngrant date\ncommon\ngrant date\ncommon\ngrant date\nshare data)\nshares\nfair value\nshares\nfair value\nshares\nfair value\nNonvested - beginning of year\n$\n82.55\n$\n76.10\n$\n74.57\nGranted\n105.72\n92.34\n78.96\nVested\n(106\n)\n82.04\n(72\n)\n78.81\n(69\n)\n75.10\nForfeitures\n(7\n)\n106.25\n(10\n)\n80.06\n(12\n)\n79.02\nNonvested - end of year\n97.66\n82.55\n76.10\nThe total grant date fair value of nonvested stock awards that vested during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $8 million, $6 million and $5 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, there was $6 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested stock awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.3 years.\nCash-settled nonvested stock awards\nCertain nonvested stock awards are granted to employees and are settled in cash upon vesting. As of September 30, 2023, 54 thousand cash-settled nonvested stock awards were outstanding. The value of these cash-settled nonvested stock awards changes in connection with changes in the fair market value of the Ashland Common Stock. These awards generally vest over a period of three years. The expense recognized related to cash-settled nonvested stock awards was zero, $6 million, and $3 million during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPerformance awards\nAshland sponsors a long-term incentive plan that awards performance shares/units to certain key employees that are tied to Ashlands overall financial performance relative to the financial performance of selected industry peer groups and/or internal targets. Awards are granted annually, with each award covering a three-year measurement period and vesting over a one to three year period. Nonvested performance shares/units do not entitle employees to vote the shares or to receive any dividends thereon.\nEach awarded performance share is convertible to one share of Ashland Common Stock and recorded as a component of stockholders equity. Performance measures used to determine the actual number of performance shares issuable upon vesting includes 60:40 weighting of Ashlands total shareholder return (TSR) performance and Ashlands return on net assets (RONA) performance as compared to internal targets. TSR relative to peers is considered a market condition while RONA is considered a performance condition in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following table shows the performance shares/units granted for all plans that award Ashland Common Stock.\nWeighted-\nTarget\naverage\nshares/units\nfair value per\n(In thousands)\nVesting period\ngranted (a)\nshare/unit (a)\nFiscal Year 2023\nOctober 1, 2022 - September 30, 2025\n$\n135.93\nFiscal Year 2022\nOctober 1, 2021 - September 30, 2024\n$\n131.33\nFiscal Year 2021\nOctober 1, 2020 - September 30, 2023\n$\n90.44\n(a)At the end of the performance period, the actual number of shares/units awarded can range from zero to 200% of the target shares/units granted, which is assumed to be 100%. Both the shares granted and weighted-average fair value per share/unit are as of the grant date.\nFor these awards, the fair value of the performance unit awards is equal to the fair market value of Ashlands Common Stock as of the end of each reporting period. Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied.\nThe fair values of the TSR portion of the performance share awards and TSR modifier of the performance unit awards are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model using key assumptions included in the following table. Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied.\nRisk-free interest rate\n4.22\n%\n1.18\n%\n0.2\n%\nExpected dividend yield\n1.3\n%\n1.3\n%\n1.6%\nExpected life (in years)\nExpected volatility\n35.1\n%\n33.4\n%\n32.7%\nThe following table shows changes in nonvested performance shares/units for all plans that award Ashland Common Stock.\nWeighted-\nWeighted-\nWeighted-\naverage\naverage\naverage\n(In thousands except per\nShares/\ngrant date\nShares/\ngrant date\nShares/\ngrant date\nshare data)\nUnits\nfair value\nUnits\nfair value\nUnits\nfair value\nNonvested - beginning of year\n$\n105.78\n$\n88.66\n$\n80.86\nGranted\n135.93\n131.33\n90.44\nVested\n(88\n)\n84.33\n(1\n)\n96.32\n(79\n)\n68.93\nForfeitures\n(33\n)\n94.53\n(52\n)\n85.78\n(17\n)\n89.36\nNonvested - end of year\n118.43\n105.78\n88.66\nAs of September 30, 2023, there was $10 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested performance share/unit awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.5 years.\nNOTE P - REVENUE\nTrade receivables\nTrade receivables are defined as receivables arising from contracts with customers and are recorded within the accounts receivable caption within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Ashlands trade receivables were $288 million and $369 million as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. See Note H for additional information on Ashland's program to sell certain receivables on a revolving basis to third party banks up to an aggregate purchase limit.\nDisaggregation of revenue\nAshland disaggregates its revenue from contracts with customers by segment and geographical region, as Ashland believes these categories best depict how management reviews the financial performance of its operations for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Ashland includes only U.S. and Canada in its North America designation and includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa in its Europe designation. See the following tables for details (Intersegment sales eliminations have been excluded. See Note Q for additional information.):\nSales by geography\n(In millions)\nLife Sciences\nNorth America\n$\n$\n$\nEurope\nAsia Pacific\nLatin America & other\n$\n$\n$\n(In millions)\nPersonal Care\nNorth America\n$\n$\n$\nEurope\nAsia Pacific\nLatin America & other\n$\n$\n$\n(In millions)\nSpecialty Additives\nNorth America\n$\n$\n$\nEurope\nAsia Pacific\nLatin America & other\n$\n$\n$\n(In millions)\nIntermediates\nNorth America\n$\n$\n$\nEurope\nAsia Pacific\nLatin America & other\n$\n$\n$\nFor fiscal 2023, Ashland had two product categories that represented 10% or greater of Ashland's total consolidated sales which were cellulosics representing 37% of total consolidated sales and polyvinylprrolidones (PVP) representing 25% of total consolidated sales.\nNOTE Q - REPORTABLE SEGMENT INFORMATION\nAshland determines its reportable segments based on how operations are managed internally for the products and services sold to customers, including how the results are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, which includes determining resource allocation methodologies used for reportable segments. Operating income and EBITDA are the primary measures of performance that are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in assessing each reportable segment's financial performance. Ashland does not aggregate operating segments to arrive at these reportable segments.\nChange in reportable segments\nOn February 28, 2022, Ashland completed the sale of its Performance Adhesives segment. The operating results and cash flows for the Performance Adhesives segment have been classified as discontinued operations within the Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented. As a result, Ashlands reportable segments include Life Sciences, Personal Care, Specialty Additives, and Intermediates.\nUnallocated and Other includes corporate governance activities and certain legacy matters. The historical segment information has been recast to conform to the current segment structure.\nReportable segment business descriptions\nLife Sciences is comprised of pharmaceuticals, nutrition, nutraceuticals, agricultural chemicals, diagnostic films (formerly known as advanced materials) and fine chemicals. Pharmaceutical solutions include controlled release polymers, disintegrants, film coatings, solubilizers, and tablet binders. Nutrition solutions include thickeners, stabilizers, emulsifiers and additives for enhancing mouthfeel, controlling moisture migration, reducing oil uptake and controlling color. Nutraceutical solutions include products for weight management, joint comfort, stomach and intestinal health, sports nutrition and general wellness, and provide custom formulation, toll processing and particle engineering solutions. Customers include pharmaceutical, food, beverage, nutraceuticals and supplements manufacturers, hospitals and radiologists and industrial manufacturers.\nPersonal Care is comprised of biofunctionals, microbial protectants (preservatives), skin care, sun care, oral care, hair care and household. These businesses have a broad range of natural, nature-derived, biodegradable, and high-performance ingredients for customer-driven solutions to help protect, renew, moisturize and revitalize skin and hair, and provide solutions for toothpastes, mouth washes and rinses, denture cleaning and care for teeth. Household supplies nature-derived rheology ingredients, biodegradable surface wetting agents, performance encapsulates, and specialty polymers for household, industrial and institutional cleaning products. Customers include formulators at large multinational branded consumer products companies and smaller, independent boutique companies.\nSpecialty Additives is comprised of rheology and performance-enhancing additives serving the architectural coatings, construction, energy, automotive and various industrial markets. Solutions include coatings additives for architectural paints, finishes and lacquers, cement and gypsum based dry mortars, ready-mixed joint compounds, synthetic plasters for commercial and residential construction, and specialty materials for industrial applications. Products include rheology modifiers (cellulosic and associative thickeners), foam control agents, surfactants and wetting agents, pH neutralizers, advanced ceramics used in catalytic converters, and environmental filters, ingredients that aid the manufacturing process of ceramic capacitors, plasma display panels and solar cells, ingredients for textile printing, thermoplastic metals and alloys for welding. Products help improve desired functional outcomes through rheology modification and control, water retention, workability, adhesive strength, binding power, film formation, deposition and suspension and emulsification. Customers include global paint manufacturers, electronics and automotive manufacturers, textile mills, the construction industry, and welders.\nIntermediates is comprised of the production of 1,4 butanediol (BDO) and related derivatives, including n-methylpyrrolidone. These products are used as chemical intermediates in the production of engineering polymers and polyurethanes, and as specialty process solvents in a wide array of applications including electronics, pharmaceuticals, water filtration membranes and more. Butanediol is also supplied to Life Sciences, Personal Care, and Specialty Additives for use as a raw material.\nUnallocated and Other generally includes items such as certain significant company-wide restructuring activities, corporate governance costs and legacy costs or activities that relate to divested businesses that are no longer operated by Ashland.\nInternational data\nInformation about Ashlands domestic and international operations follows. Ashland has no operations in any individual international country or single customer that represented more than 10% of sales in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nSales to external\ncustomers\nNet assets\n(liabilities)\nProperty, plant and\nequipment - net\n(In millions)\nUnited States\n$\n$\n$\n$\n1,532\n$\n1,857\n$\n1,032\n$\n1,042\nInternational\n1,557\n1,660\n1,474\n1,565\n1,363\n$\n2,191\n$\n2,391\n$\n2,111\n$\n3,097\n$\n3,220\n$\n1,373\n$\n1,338\nReportable segment results\nResults of Ashlands reportable segments are presented based on its management and internal accounting structure. The structure is specific to Ashland; therefore, the financial results of Ashlands reportable segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other comparable companies. Ashland allocates all costs to its reportable segments except for certain significant company-wide restructuring activities, certain corporate governance costs and other costs or activities that relate to former businesses that Ashland no longer operates. The service cost component of pension and other postretirement benefits costs is allocated to each reportable segment on a ratable basis; while the remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits costs are recorded within the other net periodic benefit loss (income) caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (loss). Ashland refines its expense allocation methodologies to the reportable segments from time to time as internal accounting practices are improved, more refined information becomes available and the industry or market changes. Significant revisions to Ashlands methodologies are adjusted for all segments on a retrospective basis. This includes changes in prior years for indirect corporate costs previously allocated to Performance Adhesives. These costs are now reflected in Unallocated and Other for all periods presented.\nAshland determined that disclosing sales by specific product was impracticable due to the highly customized and extensive portfolio of products offered to customers and since no one product or a small group of products could be aggregated together to represent a majority of revenue within a reportable segment.\nThe following table presents various financial information for each reportable segment for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nAshland Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries\nReportable Segment Information\nYears Ended September 30\n(In millions)\nSales\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\n$\nPersonal Care\nSpecialty Additives\nIntermediates\nIntersegment sales (a)\n(61\n)\n(77\n)\n(51\n)\n$\n2,191\n$\n2,391\n$\n2,111\nEquity income\nLife Sciences\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nPersonal Care\n-\nSpecialty Additives\n-\n-\n-\nIntermediates\n-\n-\n-\n$\n$\n$\n-\nOther income\nLife Sciences\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nPersonal Care\n-\n-\nSpecialty Additives\n-\n-\n-\nIntermediates\n-\n-\n-\nUnallocated and Other\n$\n$\n$\nEquity and other income\n$\n$\n$\nOperating income (loss)\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\n$\nPersonal Care (b)\nSpecialty Additives (b)\nIntermediates\nUnallocated and Other (b)\n(112\n)\n(114\n)\n(107\n)\n$\n$\n$\n(In millions)\nDepreciation expense\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\n$\nPersonal Care\nSpecialty Additives\nIntermediates\nUnallocated and Other\n-\n-\n$\n$\n$\nAmortization expense\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\n$\nPersonal Care\nSpecialty Additives\nIntermediates\n-\nUnallocated and Other\n-\n-\n-\n$\n$\n$\nEBITDA (c)\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\n$\nPersonal Care\nSpecialty Additives\nIntermediates\nUnallocated and Other\n(112\n)\n(114\n)\n(106\n)\n$\n$\n$\nAdditions to property, plant and equipment\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\n$\nPersonal Care\nSpecialty Additives\nIntermediates\nUnallocated and Other\n$\n$\n$\n(In millions)\nAssets\nLife Sciences\n$\n1,904\n$\n1,905\nPersonal Care\n1,004\n1,073\nSpecialty Additives\n1,580\n1,567\nIntermediates\nUnallocated and Other\n1,315\n1,498\n$\n5,939\n$\n6,213\nProperty, plant and equipment - net\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\nPersonal Care\nSpecialty Additives\nIntermediates\nUnallocated and Other\n$\n1,373\n$\n1,338\n(a)Intersegment sales from Intermediates are accounted for at prices that approximate fair value.

See the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for applicable amounts excluded.\nNOTE R - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn October 19, 2023, Ashland entered, through an Ireland based, wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote consolidated special purpose entity (SPE), into a three-year agreement with a group of entities (buyers) to sell certain trade receivables, without recourse beyond the pledged receivables, of certain wholly-owned Ashland subsidiaries (foreign accounts receivable sales program) in Europe. Under the agreement, Ashland can transfer whole receivables up to a limit established by the buyer, which is currently set at \u20ac125 million. Ashlands continuing involvement is limited to servicing the receivables, including billing, collections and remittance of payments to the buyers as well as a limited guarantee on over-collateralization.\nAshland determined that any receivables transferred under this agreement are put presumptively beyond the reach of Ashland and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. Ashland received true sale at law and non-consolidation opinions from independent qualified legal advisors in the jurisdiction of each originating subsidiary to support the legal isolation of these receivables. Consequently, Ashland will account for receivables transferred to buyers as part of this agreement as sales.\nIn addition, the 2018 foreign accounts receivable securitization was not extended in October 2023 with the initiation of the foreign accounts receivable sales program.\nThis page intentionally left blank."
