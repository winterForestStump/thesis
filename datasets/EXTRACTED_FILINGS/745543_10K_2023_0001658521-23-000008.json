    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS.\nCORPORATE HISTORY\nAll State Properties L.P., a limited partnership (the Partnership) was organized under the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act of Delaware on April 27, 1984 to conduct the business formerly carried on by its predecessor corporation, All State Properties, Inc. (the Corporation); and together with the Partnership, the Company. In March 2007 Hubei Longdan (Delaware), Inc. (Longdan Delaware and Subsidiary) was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Longdan Delaware had only nominal assets and no liabilities and had conducted no activities except in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement. The Company together with Longdan Delaware referred to herein as the Registrant. Pursuant to a Plan of Liquidation adopted by shareholders of the Corporation on September 30, 1984, the Corporation transferred substantially all of its assets to the Partnership, and the Corporation distributed such limited partnership interests to its shareholders. The Registrant was engaged since inception in land development and the construction and sale of residential housing in various parts of the eastern United States and in Argentina with its most recent transactions being in Florida.\nSince August 1999, the Companys only business has been the ownership of a member interest of approximately 35% in Tunicom LLC, a Florida limited liability company (Tunicom). An affiliate of Tunicom was engaged in the ownership and operation of an adult rental apartment complex until the sale of the apartment complex in August 2000. Since that time, Tunicoms only business was activities relating to its attempts to sell its only remaining asset, five acres of commercial and residential land in Broward County, Florida (the Remaining Property). For a description of the sale of the Remaining Property by Tunicom and the liquidating distribution by the Company, see Item 1(b)(i). Following the completion of the transactions described in Item 1(b)(ii) the Company became a shell company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) because it has no or nominal operations and no or nominal assets (other than cash). In March 2007, the Company entered into an Acquisition Agreement which contemplates a reverse merger with a private operating Chinese pharmaceutical company provided that certain conditions are satisfied, including approval of the transaction by its partners (See Item 1(b)(ii)).\nOn November 2, 2007, the Company terminated the Acquisition Agreement based on the breach of its terms by Longdan.\nOn December 20, 2007, Belmont Partners, LLC (Belmont), a Virginia limited liability company, entered into an agreement (the Agreement) with the Company and Stanley R. Rosenthal, an individual resident of the State of Florida (\"Rosenthal\").\nOn March 3, 2008, Greenwich Holdings LLC (Greenwich), a New York limited liability company, entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with the Company and Joseph Meuse, as General Partner of the Company and a Managing Member of Belmont Partners, LLC (Belmont), a Virginia limited liability company.\nUnder the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Belmont (the Seller), sold to Greenwich (the Buyer) fifty and one one-thousandth percent (50.001%) of the issued and outstanding partnership units (Units), which shall be not more than nine million Units (9,000,000) of the Company for one hundred eighty eight thousand U.S. dollars ($188,000.00). In conjunction with the Agreement, brokers in the transaction received 1,150,000 units and Garry McHenry received 200,000 units as compensation as the new general partner. Greenwich then received their 50.001% or 4,471,000 Units of the Company. As of March 31, 2008, the outstanding Units issued totaled 8,809,065.\nOn May 29, 2008, our predecessor, All State Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (ASP), and All State Properties Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of ASP (ASPH), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger. On May 29, 2008, ASP merged with and into ASPH, so that ASP and ASPH became a single corporation named All State Properties Holdings, Inc. (the Surviving Corporation), which is a corporation and exists under, and is governed by, the laws of the State of Nevada (the Merger)\nAs a result of the Merger, all of the assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of ASP became vested in, held and enjoyed by the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation assumed all of the obligations of ASP and we changed our name from All State Properties, L.P. to All State Properties Holdings, Inc.\nUpon the effectiveness and as a result of the Merger, the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of ASPH became the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.\nIn addition, each share of common stock of ASP that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger was converted into 1 issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (Common Stock), so that the holders of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of ASP immediately prior to the Merger are the holders of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation. All shares of ASPH owned by ASP immediately prior to the Merger were surrendered to the Surviving Corporation and cancelled.\nAll State Properties Holdings, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 24, 2008. All State Properties Holdings, Inc. was to serve as a vehicle to effect a merger, exchange of capital stock, asset acquisition, or other business combination with a domestic or foreign private business. The company not commenced planned principal operations.\nOn November 10, 2020, the majority of the shareholders and board of directors of the Registrant approved a name change for the Registrant to Petro U.S.A., Inc. to reflect a change in the business to become an operator of truck stops and travel centers in the United States, offering diesel fuel and gasoline, full service and fast-food restaurants, maintenance and repair service for trucks, and groceries and convenience goods, among other products and services.\nThe Company has a June 30 year end. As of June 30, 2023, the issued and outstanding shares of common stock totaled 200,030.920.\n(i) Remaining Property Sale\nOn December 19, 2006, Tunicom sold the Remaining Property and thereafter distributed the net sales proceeds to its members, including the Company, as a final liquidating distribution. After payment of certain debt and after setting aside a reserve for expenses, the Company distributed the remaining cash to its partners. Following the distribution, the Company has no assets.\n(ii) Acquisition Agreement\nThe Company had been negotiating a definitive agreement with Hubei Longdan Biological Medicine Technology Co., Ltd. (Longdan), a company organized under the laws of the Peoples Republic of China (the PRC), pursuant to which the Company would issue approximately eighty nine percent (89%) of its capital stock to Longdans shareholders in return for acquisition of the business of Longdan (the Acquisition). Longdan is engaged in the marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products in the PRC.\nOn March 14, 2007, the Company, Longdan Delaware, Longdan and Longdan International Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of Nevis (Longdan International), entered into an Acquisition Agreement (the Acquisition Agreement) pursuant to which the Company will acquire Longdan International and an indirect interest in Longdan and the shareholders of Longdan International will acquire a controlling interest in the Company.\nUnder the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, it is contemplated that the Company will convert from a Delaware limited partnership to a newly-formed Delaware corporation to be called Longdan International Holdings, Inc. (LIH) and Longdan International will merge with and into Longdan Delaware. At the Merger Effective Time (as defined in the Acquisition Agreement), the shareholders of Longdan will be issued shares representing approximately eighty nine percent (89%) of the capital stock of the Company and the Companys shareholders will hold shares representing approximately eleven percent (11%) of the capital stock of the Company, in each case, on an as if converted basis.\nLongdan had agreed to pay all costs associated with the Acquisition, including legal fees incurred in connection with the related corporate law transactions and required filings under the securities laws, and had also agreed to pay for any costs incurred by the Company in connection with maintaining its registration under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, after June 30, 2007.\nOn October 31, 2007 Longdan advised the Company that it will not fulfill its contractual commitment to pay these expenses. Accordingly, by its letter to Longdan dated November 2, 2007, All-State terminated the Acquisition Agreement based on this breach.\n(iii)Other Agreements\nOn December 20, 2007, Belmont Partners, LLC (Belmont), a Virginia limited liability company, entered into an agreement (the Agreement) with the Company and Stanley R. Rosenthal, an individual resident of the State of Florida (\"Rosenthal\").\nUnder the terms of the Agreement, Belmont has agreed to pay to the Company the sum of Twenty-Two Thousand Dollars ($22,000.00) (the Loan). As consideration for the Loan, the Company and Rosenthal have agreed to grant Belmont a promissory note to repay the Loan, Rosenthal has agreed to resign as the General Partner of the Company and Joseph Meuse will be appointed the General Partner. In addition, Belmont shall pay for the reasonable legal costs and expenses incurred by the Company and Rosenthal in connection with this Agreement and all related agreements and transactions contemplated by the Agreement up to an amount not to exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) in the aggregate (the Legal Expenses). To the extent Belmont pays any Legal Expenses in accordance with the above, the Company agrees that any such amount shall be added to the Loan as additional principal thereunder. Immediately upon execution of this Agreement, Belmont loaned to the Company four thousand dollars ($4,000.00) to be applied against the Legal Expenses.\nIn fiscal 2008, Stanley Rosenthal and Richard Astley surrendered 100,000 and 29,950 partnership units, respectively, back to the company. The return of the units was related to the dismissal of notes receivable in fiscal 2007. The notes receivable was non-recourse and payable solely from the Companys distributions.\nOn February 28, 2008, Greenwich Holdings, LLC (Greenwich), a New York limited liability company, entered into an agreement (the Agreement) with Belmont Partners, LLC, a Virginia limited liability company (Belmont),\nUnder the terms of the Agreement, Greenwich has agreed to purchase a control block in All-State Properties L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the Company or ASP) consisting of approximately fifty and one-thousandth percent (50.001%) of the outstanding common units of the Company (the Control Block). In consideration for the Control Block, Greenwich agreed to pay the Company One Hundred Eighty-Eight Thousand ($188,000.00) U.S. Dollars.\nA copy of the Agreement entered into by and between Belmont and Greenwich was attached as exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form8-K filed on March 3, 2008.\nOn February 17, 2009, Greenwich, sold the Control Block back o Belmont in consideration of $220,000. Said consideration was never paid by Belmont to Greenwich. On August 1, 2012, Belmont returned the Company back to the sole member of Greenwich, Joseph Passalaqua (Passalaqua). On February 3, 2017, Passalaqua transferred the Control Block to Sea Alive, Inc., a Wyoming corporation.\nOn December 8, 2017, the Company entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Maurice Parham. Under said Purchase Agreement, the Parties agreed that Joseph Passalaqua would resign from the Board of Directors of the Company and was replaced by Maurice Parham. Maurice Parham was to immediately transfer to the Company the rights to the Universal Nation business plan. Friction & Heat shall cancel its Reduced Control Stock and the Company shall issue the same amount of newly issued shares in exchange of the outstanding debt owed by the Company to Friction as of the date of execution of the Purchase Agreement.\nOn July 2, 2018, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement, whereby the parties terminated their Purchase Agreement dated December 8, 2017 with Maurice Parham in accordance with the termination provisions in said Purchase Agreement, and return the parties to their pre-Purchase Agreement status. Thereby Maurice Pelham resigned from the Company and Joseph Passalaqua was reinstated to the Board of Directors of the Company. Maurice Parham will not transfer to the Company the rights to the Universal Nation business plan.\nOUR BUSINESS\nOn May 28, 2020, the majority of the shareholders and board of directors of the Registrant approved a name change for the Registrant to Petro U.S.A., Inc. to reflect a change in the business to become an operator of truck stops and travel centers in the United States, offering diesel fuel and gasoline, full service and fast food restaurants, maintenance and repair service for trucks, and groceries and convenience goods, among other products and services.\nEMPLOYEES\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we have no employees.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.\nPETRO USA. INC.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022\nC O N T E N T S\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (Gries & Associates, LLC)\nBalance Sheets\nStatements of Operations\nStatements of Stockholders' Deficit\nStatements of Cash Flows\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nGries & Associates, LLC\nCertified Public Accountants\n501 S. Cherry Street Suite 1100\nDenver, Colorado 80246\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nBoard of Directors and Shareholders\nPetro USA, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Petro USA, Inc. (the Company), which comprise the balance sheet as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 and the related statements of Operations, Changes in Stockholders Equity, and Cash Flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements. In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United Sates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we were required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluation of the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nGoing Concern Uncertainty\nAs shown in the financial statements, the Company incurred net losses of 23,863 during the year ended June 30, 2023 and accumulated losses of $121,825,555. These factors create an uncertainty as to the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the success of raising additional capital through the issuance of common stock and the ability to generate sufficient operating revenue.

Organization, Description of Business, and Basis of Accounting\nBusiness Organization\nPetro USA, Inc, formerly All State Properties Holdings, Inc., a corporation (the Company) was organized under the state of Nevada on April 24, 2008 to conduct business formerly carried on by its predecessor partnership, All State Properties L.P. (the Partnership). The Partnership merged with the Company on May 29, 2008. The Company acquired all of the assets and assumed all of the liabilities and obligations of the Partnership. At May 29, 2008 each unit, par value $0.001 per share of the Partnership was converted into one issued and outstanding share of par value $0.0001 common stock of the Corporation.\nOn November 10, 2020, the majority of the shareholders and board of directors of the Registrant approved a name change for the Registrant to Petro U.S.A., Inc. to reflect a change in the business to become an operator of truck stops and travel centers in the United States, offering diesel fuel and gasoline, full service and fast food restaurants, maintenance and repair service for trucks, and groceries and convenience goods, among other products and services.\nThe Companys fiscal year end is June 30th.\nAccounting Basis\nThese financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting following generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America consistently applied.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability accounts, as recorded when material to the financial statements, are entirely the result of temporary differences. Temporary differences represent differences in the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes, primarily share based compensation and loss on settlement of debt.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the deferred tax asset related to the Company's net operating loss (NOL) carry forward is fully reserved. Due to the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 338, the Company may have no net operating loss carry forwards available to offset financial statement or tax return taxable income in future periods as a result of a change in control involving 50 percentage points or more of the issued and outstanding securities of the Company.\n.\nPetro USA, Inc.\nNotes to Financial Statements\nFor the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n1. Organization, Description of Business, and Basis of Accounting (Continued)\nDividends\nThe Company has not yet adopted a policy regarding the payment of dividends.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of cash, accounts payable and amounts due to related party approximates its fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. Unless otherwise noted, it is managements opinion the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.\nThe Company accounts for financial instruments in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standard Board's Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (\"ASC 820\"), which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, this policy established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\nLevel 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe following table presents assets that are measured and recognized at fair value on a non-recurring basis:\nLevel 1: None\nLevel 2: None\nLevel 3: None\nThe Fair Value Option permits entities to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. A business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value options have been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. For the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, there were no applicable items on which the fair value option was elected. The Fair Value Option may impact our consolidated financial statements in the future.\nEarnings (Loss) per Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the respective period presented in our accompanying financial statements.\nPetro USA, Inc.\nNotes to Financial Statements\nFor the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n1. Organization, Description of Business, and Basis of Accounting (Continued)\nFully diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic income (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of common stock equivalents (primarily outstanding options and warrants).\nCommon stock equivalents represent the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants, using the treasury stock method, at either the beginning of the respective period presented or the date of issuance, whichever is later, and only if the common stock equivalents are considered dilutive based upon the Companys net income (loss) position at the calculation date.\nAs of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Companys has no issued and outstanding warrants or options.\n2. Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company has incurred significant losses and is dependent on obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain the necessary funding it could cease operations as a new enterprise. This raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty\n.Income Taxes\nThe Company provides for income taxes asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. This method requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe provision for income taxes differs from the amounts which would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% to the net loss before provision for income taxes for the following reasons:\nJune 30\nIncome tax expense at statutory rate 7,210 7,210\nValuation Allowance (7,210 ) (7,210 )\nIncome tax expense per books $ - $ -\nPetro USA, Inc.\nNotes to Financial Statements\nFor the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nIncome Taxes (Continued)\nNet deferred tax assets consist of the following components as of June 30:\nNet Operating Loss Carryover (249,117 ) $ (225,254 )\nValuation Allowance 249,117 225,254\nNet Deferred Tax Asset $ - $ -\nThe Company has a net operating loss carryover of $249,117 as of June 30, 2023.\nThe Company has net operating loss carry forwards that were derived solely from operating losses from prior years. These amounts can be carried forward to offset future taxable income indefinitely. No provision was made for federal income taxes as the Company has significant net operating losses.\nAt June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company has established a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax assets as there is no assurance that the Company will generate future taxable income to utilize these assets.\nDue to the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 338, the Company may have no net operating loss carry forwards available to offset financial statement or tax return taxable income in future periods as a result of a change in control involving 50 percentage points or more of the issued and outstanding securities of the Company. The Company had no uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2023 or 2022.\n4. Capital Stock\nThe Company has 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock authorized at a par value of $0.0001 and none has been issued at June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nAt June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had 200,030,920 common shares issued and outstanding respectively.\nOn April 12, 2022, the majority of the shareholders and board of directors of the Registrant approved the issuance of an additional\nThe Company has no other classes of shares authorized for issuance. At June 30, 2022 and 2021, there were no outstanding stock options or warrants.\nPetro USA, Inc.\nNotes to Financial Statements\nFor the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n5. Related Party Transactions\nThe Amounts due to related parties are advances from a company controlled by the Company's Chief Executive Officer in order to pay operating expenses of the Company. These advances are non-interest bearing and payable upon demand.\nThe promissory note to related parties is a note for $3,500 to the Companys Chief Executive Officer accruing interest at 8% per annum.\n6. Subsequent Events\nNone ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nGRIES AND ASSOCIATES, LLC\nThis decision to engage Gries and Associates, LLC was approved by our full Board of Directors. Because we have no standing audit committee, our full Board of Directors participated in and approved the decision to change independent accountants. Presently, the Board of Directors acts as the audit committee. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\")) as of June 30, 2023. Based on such evaluation, we have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting for our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over our financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(1)pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairy reflect our transactions.\n(2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and directors; and\n(3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error or circumvention through collusion of improper overriding of controls. Therefore, even those internal control systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO 2013\") in Internal-Control-Integrated Framework and implemented a process to monitor and assess both the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls. Based on this assessment, management believes that as of June 30, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective.\nWe have instituted a remediation plan which involves reeducating our management, the accounting staff, and the administrative staff as to the elements of a completed sale. We increased the oversight of the process by increasing the frequency of involvement of outside accounting consultants. Internal systems are being put into place to track and document significant dates, such as delivery, installation and customer acceptance. In addition, the bookkeeping system has been modified so that all sales of extended warranties are automatically recorded as deferred revenue and that the amount of revenue that is ultimately recognized as warranty revenue is as the result of an analysis of the significant aspects of the warranty such as coverage and period.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of 2023. In connection with such evaluation, there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred since the beginning of our fourth quarter of 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. While there have been no changes, we have assessed our internal controls as being deficient and will be taking steps beginning in 2024 to remedy such deficiencies. ITEM 9B.

Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received and written representations from reporting persons required to file reports under Section 16(a), all of the Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to such persons, with respect to fiscal year 2023, appear not to have been complied with to the best of our knowledge.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.\nWe do not have a specific policy or procedure for the review, approval, or ratification of any transaction involving related persons. We historically have sought and obtained funding from officers, directors, and family members as these categories of persons are familiar with our management and often provide better terms and conditions than we can obtain from unassociated sources. Also, we are so small that having specific policies or procedures of this type would be unworkable. ITEM 14.
