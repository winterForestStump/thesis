As of September 30, 2023, we sold home heating oil and propane to approximately 402,200 full service residential and commercial customers and 52,400 customers on a delivery only basis. Approximately 252,700 of these customers, or 56%, are located in the New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. We believe we are the largest retail distributor of home heating oil in the United States, based upon sales volume with a market share in excess of 5.5%. We also sell gasoline and diesel fuel to approximately 26,600 customers. We install, maintain, and repair heating and air conditioning equipment and to a lesser extent provide these services outside of our heating oil and propane customer base including 20,800 service contracts for natural gas and other heating systems. During fiscal 2023, total sales were comprised of approximately 62% from home heating oil and propane, 23% from other petroleum products, the majority of which is diesel and gasoline, and 15% from the installation and repair of heating and air conditioning equipment and ancillary services. We provide home heating equipment repair service and natural gas service 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week, 52 weeks a year. These services are an integral part of our business, and are intended to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.\nWe conduct our business through an operating subsidiary, Petro Holdings, Inc., utilizing multiple local brand names, such as Petro Home Services, Meenan, and Griffith Energy Services, Inc.\nWe also offer several pricing alternatives to our residential home heating oil customers, including a variable price (market based) option and a price-protected option, the latter of which either sets the maximum price or a fixed price that a customer will pay. Users choose the plan they feel best suits them which we believe increases customer satisfaction. Approximately 94% of our full service residential and commercial home heating oil customers automatically receive deliveries based on prevailing weather conditions. In addition, approximately 32% of our residential customers take advantage of our smart pay budget payment plan under which their estimated annual oil and propane deliveries and service billings are paid for in a series of equal monthly installments. We use derivative instruments as needed to mitigate our exposure to market risks associated with our price-protected offerings and the storing of our physical home heating oil inventory. Given our size, we believe we are able to realize certain benefits of scale and provide consistent, strong customer service.\nCurrently, we have heating oil and/or propane customers in the following states: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.\nIndustry Characteristics\nHome heating oil is primarily used as a source of fuel to heat residences and businesses in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. According to the U.S. Department of Energy-Energy Information Administration, Residential Energy Consumption Survey (released May 2022), these regions account for 82% (4.1 million of 5.0 million) of the households in the United States where heating oil is the main space-heating fuel and 19% (4.1 million of 21.9 million) of the homes in these regions use home heating oil as their main space-heating fuel. Our experience has been that customers have a tendency to increase their conservation efforts as the price of home heating oil increases, thereby reducing their consumption.\nThe retail home heating oil industry is mature, with total market demand expected to decline in the foreseeable future due to conversions to natural gas and electricity, availability of other alternative energy sources and the installations of more fuel efficient heating systems. Therefore, our ability to maintain our business or grow within the industry is dependent on the acquisition of other retail distributors, the success of our marketing programs, and the growth of our other service offerings. Based on our records, our customer conversions to natural gas and electricity have ranged between 1.1% and 1.6% per year over the last five years. We believe this may continue or even increase. In addition, there are legislative and regulatory efforts underway in several states seeking to encourage homeowners to reduce or even eliminate the consumption of fossil fuels that we sell.\nThe retail home heating oil industry is highly fragmented, characterized by a large number of relatively small, independently owned and operated local distributors. Some businesses provide full service, as we do, and others offer delivery only on a cash-on-delivery basis, which we also do to a significantly lesser extent. In addition, the industry is complex and costly due to regulations, working capital requirements, and the costs and risks of hedging for price protected customers.\nPropane is a by-product of natural gas processing and petroleum refining. Propane use falls into three broad categories: residential and commercial applications; industrial applications; and agricultural uses. In the residential and commercial markets, propane is used primarily for space heating, water heating, clothes drying and cooking. Industrial customers use propane generally as a motor fuel to power over-the-road vehicles, forklifts and stationary engines, to fire furnaces, as a cutting gas and in other process applications. In the agricultural market, propane is primarily used for tobacco curing, crop drying, poultry breeding and weed control.\nThe retail propane distribution industry is highly competitive and is generally serviced by large multi-state full-service distributors and small local independent distributors. Like the home heating oil industry, each retail propane distribution provider operates in its own competitive environment because propane distributors typically reside in close proximity to their customers. In most retail propane distribution markets, customers can choose from multiple distributors based on the quality of customer service, safety, reputation and price.\nIt is common practice in our business to price our liquid products to customers based on a per gallon margin over wholesale costs. As a result, we believe distributors such as ourselves generally seek to maintain their per gallon margins by passing wholesale price increases through to customers, thus insulating their margins from the volatility in wholesale prices. However, distributors may be unable or unwilling to pass the entire product cost increases through to customers. We believe this is especially true in the propane business. In these cases, significant decreases in per gallon margins may result. The timing of cost pass-throughs can also significantly affect margins. (See Customers and Pricing for a discussion on our offerings).\nBusiness Strategy\nOur business strategy is to increase Adjusted EBITDA (See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a definition) and cash flow by effectively managing operations while growing and retaining our customer base as a retail distributor of home heating oil and propane and provider of related products and services. The key elements of this strategy include the following:\nPursue select acquisitions Our senior management team has developed expertise in identifying acquisition opportunities and integrating acquired customers into our operations. We focus on acquiring companies within and outside our current footprint.\nWe actively pursue home heating oil only companies, propane companies, dual fuel (home heating oil and propane) companies and selectively target motor fuels acquisitions, especially where they are operating in the markets we currently serve.\nDeliver superior customer service We are dedicated to consistently providing our customers with superior service and a positive customer experience to improve retention and drive additional revenue. We have established programs and conduct surveys to effectively measure customer satisfaction at certain brands.\nWe have deployed a customer relationship management solution at most of our larger brands. We believe this allows us to provide a more consistent customer experience as our employees will have a 360 degree-view of each customer with easy access to key customer information and customized dashboards to track individual employee performance.\nWe have resources dedicated to training employees to provide superior and consistent service and enhance the customer experience. This effort is supported, reinforced and monitored by our local management teams.\nProvide complementary service offerings These offerings include, but are not limited to, the sales, service and installation of heating and air conditioning equipment, and standby home generators. In addition, we also repair and install natural gas heating systems.\nPursue environmental sustainability opportunities We are committed to pursuing initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our product offerings, by offering biodiesel blended products (a renewable, biodegradable fuel manufactured from vegetable oils, animal fats, or recycled restaurant grease) and by offering energy efficient heating and air conditioning equipment to our customers.\nSeasonality\nOur fiscal year ends on September 30. All references to quarters and years respectively in this document are to fiscal quarters and years unless otherwise noted. The seasonal nature of our business results in the sale of approximately 30% of our volume of home heating oil and propane in the first fiscal quarter and 50% of our volume in the second fiscal quarter of each fiscal year, the peak heating season. Approximately 25% of our volume of motor fuel and other petroleum products is sold in each of the four fiscal quarters. We generally realize net income in our first and second fiscal quarters and net losses during our third and fourth fiscal quarters and we expect that the negative impact of seasonality on our third and fourth fiscal quarter operating results will continue. In addition, sales volume typically fluctuates from year to year in response to variations in weather, wholesale energy prices and other factors.\nDegree Day\nA degree day is an industry measurement of temperature designed to evaluate energy demand and consumption. Degree days are based on how far the average daily temperature departs from 65\u00b0F. Each degree of temperature above 65\u00b0F is counted as one cooling degree day, and each degree of temperature below 65\u00b0F is counted as one heating degree day. Degree days are accumulated each day over the course of a year and can be compared to a monthly or a multi-year average to see if a month or a year was warmer or cooler than usual. Degree days are officially observed by the National Weather Service.\nEvery ten years, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) computes and publishes average meteorological quantities, including the average temperature for the last 30 years by geographical location, and the corresponding degree days. The latest data covers the years from 1991 to 2020. Our calculations of normal weather are based on these published 30 year averages for heating degree days, weighted by volume for the locations where we have existing operations.\nCompetition\nMost of our operating locations compete with numerous distributors, primarily on the basis of price, reliability of service and response to customer needs. Each such location operates in its own competitive environment.\nCustomer Attrition\nWe measure net customer attrition for our full service residential and commercial home heating oil and propane customers. Net customer attrition is the difference between gross customer losses and customers added through marketing efforts. Customers added through acquisitions are not included in the calculation of gross customer gains. However, additional customers that are obtained through marketing efforts at newly acquired businesses are included in these calculations from the point of closing going forward. Customer attrition percentage calculations include customers added through acquisitions in the denominators of the calculations on a weighted average basis from the closing date. Gross customer losses are the result of a number of factors, including price competition, move outs, credit losses and conversions to natural gas and electrified heating systems. (See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Customer Attrition.)\nCustomers and Pricing\nThe number of home heating oil customers comprise 78% of our product customer base, with propane customers comprising another 17% and motor fuel and other petroleum product customers making up the remaining 5%. (During fiscal 2023, we sold 259.2 million gallons of home heating oil and propane and 139.0 million gallons of motor fuel and other petroleum products.)\nOur full service home heating oil customer base is comprised of 97% residential customers and 3% commercial customers. Approximately 94% of our full service residential and commercial home heating oil customers have their deliveries scheduled automatically and 6% of our home heating oil customer base call from time to time to schedule a delivery. Automatic deliveries are scheduled based on each customers historical consumption pattern and prevailing weather conditions. Our practice is to bill customers promptly after delivery. We offer a balanced payment plan to residential customers in which a customers estimated annual oil purchases and service contract fees are paid for in a series of equal monthly payments. Approximately 32% of our residential home heating oil customers have selected this billing option.\nWe offer several pricing alternatives to our residential home heating oil customers. Our \"variable\" pricing program allows the price to float with the heating oil market and other factors. In addition, we offer price-protected programs, which establish either a \"ceiling\" or a \"fixed price\" per gallon that the customer pays over a defined period. The following chart depicts the percentage of the pricing plans selected by our residential home heating oil customers as of the end of the fiscal year.\nPercentage of Residential Home Heating Oil Customers\nSeptember 30,\nPricing Programs\nVariable\n55.6\n%\n57.0\n%\n55.0\n%\n54.4\n%\n53.9\n%\nCeiling\n37.8\n%\n37.6\n%\n39.0\n%\n38.5\n%\n39.1\n%\nFixed\n6.6\n%\n5.4\n%\n6.0\n%\n7.1\n%\n7.0\n%\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\nSales to residential customers ordinarily generate higher per gallon margins than sales to commercial customers. Due to greater price sensitivity, our own internal marketing efforts, and hedging costs of residential price-protected customers, the per gallon margins realized from price-protected customers generally are less than from variable priced residential customers.\nThe propane customer base has a similar profile to heating oil residential and commercial customers. Pricing plans chosen by propane customers are almost exclusively variable in nature where selling prices will float with the propane market and other commercial factors.\nThe motor fuel and other petroleum products customer group includes commercial and industrial customers of unbranded diesel, gasoline, kerosene and related distillate products. We sell products to these customers through contracts of various terms or through a competitive bidding process.\nDerivatives\nWe use derivative instruments in order to mitigate our exposure to market risk associated with the purchase of home heating oil for our price-protected customers, physical inventory on hand, inventory in transit, priced purchase commitments, and the variable interest rate on a portion of our term loan. Currently, the Companys derivative instruments are with the following counterparties: Bank of America, N.A., Bank of Montreal, Cargill, Inc., Citibank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Key Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815-10-05, Derivatives and Hedging, requires that derivative instruments be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. To the extent our interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are effective, as defined under this guidance, changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We have elected not to designate our commodity derivative instruments as hedging instruments under this guidance, and as a result, the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments during the holding period are recognized in our statement of operations. Therefore, we experience volatility in earnings as outstanding derivative instruments are marked to market and non-cash gains and losses are recorded prior to the sale of the commodity to the customer. The volatility in any given period related to unrealized non-cash gains or losses on derivative instruments can be significant to our overall results. However, we ultimately expect those gains and losses to be offset by the cost of product when purchased. Depending on the risk being hedged, realized gains and losses are recorded in cost of product, cost of installations and services, or delivery and branch expenses.\nSuppliers and Supply Arrangements\nWe purchase our products for delivery in either barge, pipeline or truckload quantities. As of September 30, 2023 we had contracts with approximately 124 third-party terminal sites for the right to temporarily store petroleum products at their facilities. Home heating oil and propane purchases are made under supply contracts or on the spot market. We have entered into New York Mercantile Exchange (\"NYMEX\") or Platts American Gulf Coast based physical supply contracts for approximately 76% of our expected home heating oil and propane requirements for our full service residential and commercial customers for the fiscal 2024 heating season. For the fiscal year 2024 heating season, approximately 76% of the Companys contracted home heating oil volume with suppliers has a biofuel component. We also have entered into NYMEX or Platts American Gulf Coast based physical supply contracts for approximately 43% of our expected diesel and gasoline requirements for fiscal 2024.\nDuring fiscal 2023, Shell Trading and Shell Oil Products US provided approximately 18% of our petroleum purchases and Motiva Enterprises LLC provided 14% of our petroleum product purchases. During fiscal 2022, Global Companies LLC and Motiva Enterprises LLC provided approximately 17% and 14% of our petroleum product purchases, respectively. Our supply contracts typically have terms of 6 to 12 months. For fiscal 2024, approximately 26% of our physical supply contracts are with Shell Trading and Shell Oil Products US. All of our supply contracts provide for minimum quantities and in most cases do not establish in advance the price of home heating oil or propane. This price is based upon a published index price at the time of delivery or pricing date plus an agreed upon differential. We believe that our policy of contracting for the majority of our anticipated supply needs with diverse and reliable sources will enable us to obtain sufficient product should unforeseen shortages develop in worldwide supplies.\nLiquid Product Price Volatility\nVolatility, which is reflected in the wholesale price of liquid products, including home heating oil, propane and motor fuels, has a larger impact on our business when prices rise. Home heating oil consumers are price sensitive to heating cost increases, and this often leads to customer conservation and increased gross customer losses. As a commodity, the price of home heating oil is generally impacted by many factors, including economic and geopolitical forces, and is closely linked to the price of diesel fuel. The volatility in the wholesale cost of diesel fuel as measured by the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2019, through 2023, on a quarterly basis, is illustrated in the following chart (price per gallon):\nFiscal 2023 (a)\nFiscal 2022\nFiscal 2021\nFiscal 2020\nFiscal 2019\nQuarter Ended\nLow\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nDecember 31\n$\n2.78\n$\n4.55\n$\n2.06\n$\n2.59\n$\n1.08\n$\n1.51\n$\n1.86\n$\n2.05\n$\n1.66\n$\n2.44\nMarch 31\n2.61\n3.55\n2.36\n4.44\n1.46\n1.97\n0.95\n2.06\n1.70\n2.04\nJune 30\n2.23\n2.73\n3.27\n5.14\n1.77\n2.16\n0.61\n1.22\n1.78\n2.12\nSeptember 30\n2.38\n3.48\n3.13\n4.01\n1.91\n2.34\n1.08\n1.28\n1.75\n2.08\n(a)On November 30, 2023, the NYMEX ultra low sulfur diesel contract closed at $2.83 per gallon.\nAcquisitions\nPart of our business strategy is to pursue select acquisitions. Each acquired companys operating results are included in the Companys consolidated financial statements starting on its acquisition date. Customer lists, other intangibles (excluding goodwill) and trade names are amortized on a straight-line basis over seven to twenty years.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company acquired one propane and two heating oil businesses for approximately $19.8 million (using $19.8 million in cash). The gross purchase price was allocated $10.4 million to intangible assets, $8.0 million to goodwill, $2.3 million to fixed assets and reduced by $0.9 million of negative working capital.\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company acquired five heating oil businesses for approximately $15.6 million (using $13.1 million in cash and assuming $2.5 million of liabilities). The gross purchase price was allocated $7.3 million to intangible assets, $3.1 million to goodwill, $5.6 million to fixed assets and reduced by $0.4 million of negative working capital.\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Company acquired two propane and three heating oil businesses for approximately $42.5 million (using $40.7 million in cash and assuming $1.8 million of liabilities). The gross purchase price was allocated $37.3 million to goodwill and intangible assets, $6.2 million to fixed assets and reduced by $1.0 million of negative working capital.\nEmployees and Human Capital Management\nWe consider our employees a key factor to Stars success and we are focused on attracting and retaining the best employees at all levels of our business. In particular, our dedication to providing superior customer service depends significantly on employee satisfaction and retention. We strive to create a productive and collaborative work environment for our employees. Our human capital measures and objectives focus on safety of our employees, employee benefits, and employee development and training.\nThe safety of our employees and customers is paramount. We strive to ensure that all employees feel safe in their respective work environment. Since March 2020, a portion of our office personnel have worked remotely. We believe that our employees have adapted well and continue to be flexible to the changing working conditions.\nTo attract talent and meet the needs of our employees, we offer benefits packages for full-time employees. We offer a health and welfare and retirement program to all eligible employees. We also provide our employees with resources for professional development including technical training, feedback and performance reviews from supervisors, and management training.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had 3,052 employees, of whom 822 were office, clerical and customer service personnel; 831 were equipment technicians; 504 were fuel delivery drivers and mechanics; 579 were management and 316 were employed in sales. Of these employees 1,354 (44%) are represented by 62 different collective bargaining agreements with local chapters of labor unions. Due to the seasonal nature of our business and depending on the demands of the 2024 heating season, we anticipate that we will augment our current staffing levels during the heating season from among the 279 employees on temporary leave of absence as of September 30, 2023. There are 19 collective bargaining agreements up for renewal in fiscal 2024, covering approximately 289 employees (9%). We believe that our relations with both our union and non-union employees are generally satisfactory.\nGovernment Regulations\nRegulations in Response to Climate Change. There is increasing attention in the United States and worldwide concerning the issue of climate change and the effect of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, in particular, from the combustion of carbon-based fossil fuels. Our heating oil and propane products are widely considered to be fossil fuels that produce GHG emissions. To combat the cause of global warming domestically, President Biden identified climate change as one of his administrations top priorities and pledged to seek measures that would pave the path for the U.S. to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050. In April 2021, President Biden announced the administrations plan to reduce the U.S. GHG emissions by at least 50% by 2030. These environmental goals earned a prominent place in the Biden administrations $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, which was signed into law on November 15, 2021. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act which aims to reduce GHG emissions by offering tax and other financial incentives designed to encourage homeowners to switch to alternative sources of energy other than those we sell, including a tax rebate of up to $8,000 per qualified household for the installation of an electric heat pump for a homes primary heat source. States must apply for rebate funding with the U.S. Department of Energy and adopt and administer energy rebate programs within their respective states before homeowners can apply and receive tax rebates under the program. The timing of when the various states within our operating footprint will adopt energy rebate programs in order to distribute homeowner rebates remains uncertain.\nNumerous states and municipalities have also adopted laws and policies on climate change and emission reduction targets. For example, on July 18, 2019, the State of New York (location of 43% of our residential home heating oil and propane customers) passed the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA). Among other things, the CLCPA sets out a series of emissions reduction, renewable energy, and energy storage goals to significantly reduce the use of carbon-based fossil fuels and eventually achieve net zero GHG emissions in the state. In December 2022, New York approved the Scoping Plan, which details actions required to advance directives stated in the CLCPA and to enable New York to limit GHG emissions as a percentage of 1990 emissions to 60% by 2030 and to 15% by 2050. The CLCPA gives the New York Department of Energy Conservation until January 1, 2024 to promulgate regulations to ensure that the State of New York meets the CLCPAs GHG emission limits as outlined in the Scoping Plan.\nOn May 2, 2023, the State of New York adopted its 2024 fiscal year budget, which included amendments to New Yorks Energy Law and to its Executive Law that prohibit the installation of fossil-fuel equipment and building systems in any new buildings under seven stories, except for a new commercial or industrial building greater than 100,000 square feet in conditioned floor area beginning December 31, 2025 (the Fossil Fuel Ban). The Fossil Fuel Ban applies to equipment that uses heating oil, propane and natural gas for combustion and will then expand to all new buildings beginning January 1, 2029. Specifically, the Energy Law and the Executive Law direct the New York State Fire Prevention and Building Code Council (the Code Council) to include the Fossil Fuel Ban on installation of fossil-fuel burning equipment and building systems in new buildings in the State of New Yorks Energy Conservation Construction Code (the Energy Code) and in the Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code (the Building Code). We understand that the Code Council has begun the process of integrating the Fossil Fuel Ban into the Energy Code and the Building Code.\nOn October 12, 2023, a coalition of businesses, trade associations and labor unions including the National Propane Gas Association, New York Propane Gas Association and Mulhern Gas Co., filed a federal lawsuit in the Northern District of New York (Mulhern Gas Co., Inc. et al v. Rodriguez, et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-1267) claiming that the Fossil Fuel Ban violates federal law. The lawsuit seeks to declare the Fossil Fuel Ban invalid and to block its enforcement on the grounds that it is preempted by the federal Energy Policy and Conservation Act (\"EPCA\"). It relies on a recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (California Restaurant Association v. City of Berkeley) which held that a ban on gas piping in a new building in Berkeley, California was invalid on the basis that it concerned the energy use of appliances covered by the EPCA and was therefore preempted by federal law. As this legal challenge to the Fossil Fuel Ban is in the very early stages, it is uncertain what impact, if any, it will have on the Companys operations in the State of New York.\nIn May 2019, New York City (location of 3% of our residential home heating oil and propane customers) enacted Local Law 97 as a part of the Climate Mobilization Act aimed at reducing GHG emissions by 80% from commercial and residential buildings by 2050. Starting in 2024, this law will place carbon caps on most buildings larger than 25,000 square feet. In addition, in December 2021, New York City passed Local Law 154 of 2021, which will phase out fossil fuel usage in newly constructed residential and commercial buildings starting in 2024 for lower-rise buildings, and in 2027 for taller buildings. With few exceptions, all new buildings constructed in New York City must be fully electric by 2027.\nIn March 2021, the State of Massachusetts (location of 5% of our residential home heating oil and propane customers) signed into law An Act Creating A Next-Generation Roadmap for Massachusetts Climate Policy (the 2021 Climate Law) that establishes a 2030 limit of at least a 50% reduction in GHG emissions below the 1990 GHG emissions baseline and requires the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs to set interim emissions limits and sector-specific sublimits every five years. The 2021 Climate Law tasks the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (the MassDEP) with developing a high-level program to meet the emissions limit for residential, commercial, and industrial heating and identified a Clean Heat Standard (CHS) as a regulatory option for addressing this requirement. The proposed regulations released by MassDEP in May 2023 could require, among other things, heating energy suppliers to demonstrate the conversion of approximately 3% of their customers to electric heat each year. Such proposed regulations, if adopted, could dramatically negatively impact the Companys Massachusetts operations and impose onerous reporting requirements on the Company.\nOn August 11, 2022, the State of Massachusetts signed into law An Act Driving Clean Energy and Offshore Wind (the 2022 Climate Law). The 2022 Climate Law establishes a new pilot program to allow up to 10 municipalities to require through zoning that new construction or substantial renovation projects will be fossil-fuel free, and instructs the States Department of Energy Resources (DOER) to adopt regulations to structure the pilot program. The DOER adopted final regulations structuring the pilot program in July 2023. The purpose of the pilot program is to allow the DOER to study the implementation of fossil fuel bans in municipalities and evaluate future best practices on decarbonization.\nThese measures, which have or may have the effect of reducing or eliminating GHG emissions from fossil fuel-burning vehicles, boilers and furnaces, could significantly negatively impact the Companys operations in New York City, New York State and Massachusetts, which together constitute a material portion of the Companys business. Other states in which the Company operates and that are material to the Companys operations, such as Connecticut, Rhode Island and New Jersey, have adopted similar GHG laws or have otherwise announced GHG reduction targets. However, while we cannot predict at this time whether and in what manner the New York CLCPA, the Massachusetts 2021 Climate Law, the Massachusetts 2022 Climate Law, or other state and local GHG laws or targets could impact the Company, these measures could over time have a material negative impact on the Company.\nEnvironmental and Safety Regulations. We are also subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Generally, these laws impose limitations on the discharge or emission of pollutants and establish standards for the handling of solid and hazardous wastes. These laws include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Clean Air Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, the Clean Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act, and comparable state statutes. CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liabilities without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Products stored and/or delivered by us and certain automotive waste products generated by our fleet are hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA or otherwise subject to investigation and cleanup under other environmental laws and regulations. While we are currently not involved with any material CERCLA claims, and we have implemented programs and policies designed to address potential liabilities and costs under applicable environmental laws and regulations, failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties or injunctive relief in cases of non-compliance or impose liability for remediation costs.\nWe have incurred and continue to incur costs to address soil and groundwater contamination at some of our locations, including legacy contamination at properties that we have acquired. A number of our properties are what is currently undergoing remediation, in some instances funded by prior owners or operators contractually obligated to do so. To date, no material issues have arisen with respect to such prior owners or operators addressing such remediation, although there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case. In addition, we have been subject to proceedings by regulatory authorities for alleged violations of environmental and safety laws and regulations. We do not expect any of these liabilities or proceedings of which we are aware to result in material costs to, or disruptions of, our business or operations.\nTransportation of our products by truck is subject to regulations promulgated under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act. These regulations cover the transportation of hazardous materials and are administered by the United States Department of Transportation or similar state agencies. Several of our oil terminals are governed under the United States Coast Guard operations Oversite, Federal OPA 90 FRP programs and Federal Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure programs. All of our propane bulk terminals are governed under Homeland Security Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards programs. We conduct ongoing training programs to help ensure that our operations are in compliance with applicable regulations. We maintain various permits that are necessary to operate some of our facilities, some of which may be material to our operations. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully the risk factors discussed below, as well as all other information, as an investment in the Company involves a high degree of risk. We are subject to certain risks and hazards due to the nature of the business activities we conduct. The risks discussed below, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and cash available for distributions to our unitholders, could result in a partial or total loss of your investment, and are not the only risks we face. We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or, as a result of developments occurring in the future, conditions that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect us.\nWholesale Product Price Volatility and Supply Risks Associated with our Business\nFluctuations in wholesale product costs may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nIncreases in wholesale product costs may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the following:\nreduced profit margins;\ncustomer conservation;\ncustomer attrition due to customers converting to lower cost heating products or suppliers;\nreduced liquidity as a result of higher net receivables including customer credit balances, and/or inventory balances as we must fund a portion of any increase in receivables, inventory and hedging costs from our own cash resources and thereby reduce or eliminate funds that would otherwise be available for distributions and other purposes;\nhigher interest expense as a result of increased working capital borrowing to finance higher receivables and/or inventory balances; and higher bad debt expense and credit card processing costs as a result of higher selling prices.\nOur business is a margin-based business in which gross profit depends on the excess of sales prices per gallon over supply costs per gallon. Consequently, our profitability is sensitive to increases in the wholesale product cost caused by changes in supply, geopolitical forces and other market conditions. Although our wholesale product costs are closely linked to the price of diesel fuel, diesel fuel prices do not always correspond to increases or decreases in consumer demand for our products. Consequently, our wholesale product prices may rise even though demand for our heating oil products is down due to, among other things, warm winter temperatures. Significant increases in product costs result in higher operating expenses, such as credit card fees, bad debt expense, and vehicle fuels, and also lead to higher working capital requirements, including higher premiums and cash requirements for some of our hedging instruments. In certain cases, we cannot pass on to our customers immediately or in full all cost increases by increasing our retail sales prices. This, in turn, negatively affects our profit margins. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact of periods of high wholesale product costs on future profit margins.\nDuring periods of high wholesale product costs, the prices we charge our customers generally increase. High prices can lead to customer conservation and attrition, resulting in reduced demand for our products. Additionally, in an effort to retain existing accounts and attract new customers we may offer discounts, which will impact the net per gallon gross margin realized. Increases in in wholesale product prices may also slow our customer collections as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their bills, leading to higher accounts receivable.\nIf increases in wholesale product costs cause our working capital requirements to exceed the amounts available under our revolving credit facility or should we fail to maintain the required availability or fixed charge coverage ratio, we would not have sufficient working capital to operate our business or cash available for distributions to unitholders.\nWhen the wholesale price of home heating oil declines significantly after a customer enters into a price protection arrangement, some customers attempt to renegotiate their arrangement in order to enter into a lower cost pricing plan with us or terminate their arrangement and switch to a competitor, which may which may adversely impact our gross profit and operating results.\nIf, due to supply constraints or shortages, we cannot purchase sufficient quantities of products to meet our customers needs, our business and operations will be adversely affected.\nConstraints in physical product supplies have been caused by numerous factors, including imbalances in supply and demand of liquid product, exacerbated by geopolitical forces, such as the wars in the Ukraine and in the Middle East. In addition, backwardated energy markets, which exist when the current market price of wholesale product is higher than the futures price, have caused and may in the future cause suppliers to reduce physical inventories. We expect to cover a substantial majority of our expected heating oil and propane needs during the heating season for our full service residential and commercial customers with physical supply contracts and inventory on-hand at the beginning of the heating season. The remainder of our customers needs are satisfied through spot product purchases. During periods when supplies are constrained, we have paid and may continue to pay significant premiums over the wholesale product cost to ensure prompt delivery of spot purchases. In certain cases, these premium payments cannot be passed on to our customers, thereby reducing our profit margins.\nOur hedging strategy may adversely affect our liquidity.\nWe purchase derivatives, futures and swaps of diesel fuel primarily from members of our lending group and Cargill in order to mitigate exposure to market risk associated with our inventory and the purchase of home heating oil for price-protected customers. Future positions require an initial cash margin deposit and daily mark to market maintenance margin, whereas options are generally paid either upfront or when they expire. Any cash payment reduces our liquidity, as we must pay for the option before any sales are made to the customer. Mark-to-market exposure with our bank group reduces our borrowing base and as such can reduce the amount available to us under our Credit Agreement.\nA significant portion of our home heating oil volume is sold to price-protected customers (ceiling and fixed), and our gross margins could be adversely affected if we are not able to effectively hedge against fluctuations in the volume and cost of product sold to these customers.\nA significant portion of our home heating oil volume is sold to individual customers under arrangements pre-establishing the ceiling sales price or a fixed price of home heating oil over a fixed period. When the customer makes a purchase commitment for the next period, we currently purchase option contracts, swaps and futures contracts for diesel fuel covering a substantial majority of the heating oil that we expect to sell to these price-protected customers. The price of heating oil is closely linked to the price of diesel fuel. The amount of home heating oil volume that we hedge per price-protected customer with diesel fuel derivatives is based upon the estimated fuel consumption per average customer, per month by location. If the actual usage exceeds the amount of the hedged volume on a monthly basis, we could be required to obtain additional volume at unfavorable margins. In addition, should actual usage in any month be less than the hedged volume (including, for example, as a result of warm winters and early terminations by price protected customers), we may incur additional hedging costs which reduce our gross profit margins. Currently, we have elected not to designate our derivative instruments as hedging instruments under FASB ASC 815-10-05 Derivatives and Hedging, and the change in fair value of the derivative instruments is recognized in our statement of operations. Therefore, we experience volatility in earnings as these currently outstanding derivative contracts are marked to market and non-cash gains or losses are recorded in the statement of operations.\nOur risk management policies cannot eliminate all commodity price risk or the impact of adverse market conditions which can adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. In addition, any noncompliance with our risk management policies could result in significant financial losses.\nWhile our hedging policies are designed to minimize commodity risk, some degree of exposure to unforeseen fluctuations in market conditions remains. For example, we change our hedged position daily in response to movements in our inventory. Any difference between the estimated future sales from inventory and actual sales will create a mismatch between the amount of inventory and the hedges against that inventory, and thus change the commodity risk position that we are trying to maintain. We monitor processes and procedures to reduce the risk of unauthorized trading and to maintain substantial balance between purchases and sales or future delivery obligations. We can provide no assurance, however, that these steps will detect and/or prevent all violations of such risk management policies and procedures, particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved.\nWe rely on the continued solvency of our wholesale product suppliers and derivatives, insurance and weather hedge counterparties.\nIf one of our wholesale product suppliers were to fail, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted, as we may be required to purchase product from other sources which may be at higher prices than we were prepared to pay. If counterparties to the derivative instruments that we use to hedge the cost of home heating oil sold to price-protected customers, physical inventory and our vehicle fuel costs were to fail, our liquidity, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted, as we would be obligated to fulfill our operational requirement of purchasing, storing and selling home heating oil and vehicle fuel, while losing the mitigating benefits of economic hedges with a failed counterparty. If one of our insurance carriers were to fail, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted, as we would have to fund any catastrophic loss. If our weather hedge counterparty were to fail, we would lose the protection of our weather hedge contract.\nRisks Related to Customer Attrition, Competition, and Demand for Our Products\nOur operating results will be adversely affected if we continue to experience significant net customer attrition in our home heating oil and propane customer base.\nThe following table depicts our gross customer gains, losses and net attrition from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2023. Net customer attrition is the difference between gross customer losses and customers added through marketing efforts. Customers added through acquisitions are not included in the calculation of gross customer gains. However, additional customer gains that are obtained through marketing efforts or lost at newly acquired businesses are included in these calculations from the point of closing going forward. Customer attrition percentage calculations include customers added through acquisitions in the denominators of the calculations on a weighted average basis from the closing date.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\nGross customer gains\n12.0\n%\n11.9\n%\n10.7\n%\n12.2\n%\n12.9\n%\nGross customer losses\n15.6\n%\n15.6\n%\n14.6\n%\n15.6\n%\n18.3\n%\nNet attrition\n(3.6\n%)\n(3.7\n%)\n(3.9\n%)\n(3.4\n%)\n(5.4\n%)\nThe gain of a new customer does not fully compensate for the loss of an existing customer because of the expenses incurred during the first year to add a new customer. Typically, the per gallon margin realized from a new account added is less than the margin of a customer that switches to another provider. Customer losses are the result of various factors, including but not limited to, wholesale product price volatility, price competition, warmer than normal weather, customer relocations and home sales/foreclosures, credit worthiness, service disruptions, and conversions to natural gas and electricity.\nPeriods of high wholesale product costs due to energy market volatility and inflation have added to our difficulty in reducing net customer attrition. Warmer than normal weather has also contributed to an increase in attrition as customers perceive less need for a full-service provider like ourselves.\nIf we are not able to reduce the current level of net customer attrition or if such level should increase, attrition will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and cash available for distributions to unitholders. For additional information about customer attrition, see Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Customer Attrition.\nBecause of the highly competitive nature of our business, we may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers, which would have an adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to substantial competition. Most of our operating locations compete with numerous distributors, primarily on the basis of price, reliability of service and responsiveness to customer service needs. Each operating location operates in its own competitive environment.\nWe compete with distributors offering a broad range of services and prices, from full-service distributors, such as ourselves, to those offering delivery only. As do many companies in our business, we provide home heating equipment repair service on a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week, 52 weeks a year basis. We believe that this tends to build customer loyalty. In some instances, homeowners have formed buying cooperatives that seek to purchase home heating oil from distributors at a price lower than individual customers are otherwise able to obtain. We also compete for retail customers with suppliers of alternative energy products, principally natural gas, propane (in the case of our home heating oil operations) and electricity. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose existing customers and/or fail to acquire new customers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur operating results will be adversely affected if we experience significant net customer attrition from conversions to alternative energy products, principally natural gas or electricity.\nThe following table depicts our estimated customer losses to natural gas conversions for the last five fiscal years. Losses to natural gas in our footprint for the home heating oil industry could be greater or less than our estimates.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\nCustomer losses to natural gas conversion and electricity\n(1.6\n)%\n(1.5\n)%\n(1.1\n)%\n(1.1\n)%\n(1.4\n)%\nIn addition to our direct customer losses to natural gas and electricity competition, any conversion to natural gas or electricity by a heating oil consumer in our geographic footprint reduces the pool of available customers from which we can gain new heating oil customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, we will not be able to replace or grow our declining customer base.\nGenerally, heating oil and propane are secondary energy choices for new housing construction, because natural gas is usually selected when the infrastructure exists. In certain areas in our operating footprint, state and local legislatures are mandating the replacement of heating systems using fossil fuels, such as heating oil and propane, with systems using electricity in new building construction. As such, our industry is declining. Accordingly, our ability to maintain or grow our customer base will depend on our ability to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms. We cannot assure that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates in the future or that we will be able to acquire businesses on economically acceptable terms. Adverse operating and financial results may limit our access to capital and adversely affect our ability to make acquisitions.\nOur acquisition activities could result in operational difficulties, unrecoverable costs and other negative consequences, any of which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny acquisition may involve potential risks to us and ultimately to our unitholders, including an increase in our indebtedness, an increase in our working capital requirements, an inability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, an excess of customer loss from the acquired business, loss of key employees from the acquired business and the assumption of additional liabilities, including environmental liabilities.\nSince weather conditions may adversely affect the demand for home heating oil and propane, our business, operating results and financial condition are vulnerable to warm winters.\nWeather conditions in regions in which we operate have a significant impact on the demand for home heating oil and propane because our customers depend on this product largely for space heating purposes. As a result, weather conditions may materially adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. During the peak-heating season of October through March, sales of home heating oil and propane historically have represented approximately 80% of our annual volume sold. Actual weather conditions can vary substantially from year to year or from month to month, significantly affecting our financial performance. Climate change may result in increased weather volatility. See We face possible risks and costs associated with the effects of changes in climate and severe weather in these Risk Factors. Warmer than normal temperatures in one or more regions in which we\noperate can significantly decrease the total volume we sell and the gross profit realized and, consequently, our results of operations.\nTo partially mitigate the adverse effect of warm weather on cash flows, we have used weather hedge contracts for a number of years. In general, such weather hedge contracts provide that we are entitled to receive a specific payment per heating degree-day shortfall, when the total number of heating degree-days in the hedge period is less than the ten year average. The payment thresholds, or strikes, are set at various levels. The hedge period runs from November 1, through March 31, of a fiscal year taken as a whole. Although we have entered into weather hedges for fiscal 2024 and in prior years' periods, there can be no assurance that weather hedge contracts on historical terms and prices will continue to be available past fiscal 2024. There can be no assurance that our weather hedge contracts, if any, will fully or substantially offset the adverse effects of warmer weather on our business and operating results or that colder weather will result in enough profit to offset our hedging costs.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations since the demand for home heating oil and propane is greater during the first and second fiscal quarter of our fiscal year, which is the peak heating season. The seasonal nature of our business has resulted on average in the last five years in the sale of approximately 30% of our volume of home heating oil and propane in the first fiscal quarter and 50% of our volume in the second fiscal quarter of each fiscal year. As a result, we generally realize net income in our first and second fiscal quarters and net losses during our third and fourth fiscal quarters and we expect that the negative impact of seasonality on our third and fourth fiscal quarter operating results will continue. Thus, any material reduction in the profitability of the first and second quarters for any reason, including warmer than normal weather and wholesale product price volatility, generally cannot be made up by any significant profitability improvements in the results of the third and fourth quarters.\nWe face possible risks and costs associated with effects of changes in climate and severe weather.\nWe cannot predict changes in climate. The physical effects of changes in climate could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Since weather conditions may adversely affect the demand for home heating oil and propane, our business, operating results and financial condition are vulnerable to warm winters. To the extent that changes in climate impact weather patterns, our markets could experience severe weather. If the frequency or magnitude of severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, blizzards or earthquakes increase, as a result of changes in climate or for other reasons, our results of operations and our financial performance could be negatively impacted by the extent of damage to our facilities or to our customers residential homes and business structures, or of disruption to the supply or delivery of the products we sell.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Environmental Matters - See also Item 1 Business - Government Regulations\nFederal, state and local legislation in response to climate change has the potential to adversely impact the Companys operations and reduce demand for our products and services.\nThere is increasing attention in the United States and worldwide concerning the issue of climate change and the effect of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, from the combustion of carbon-based fossil fuels. Our heating oil and propane products are widely considered to be fossil fuels that produce GHG emissions. To combat the cause of global warming domestically, President Biden identified climate change as one of his administrations top priorities and pledged to seek measures that would pave the path for the U.S. to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act which aims to reduce GHG emissions by offering tax and other incentives desired to encourage homeowners to switch to alternative sources of energy than the ones we sell. In addition, the State of New York, where a majority of our operations are located, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut and certain municipalities in our operating footprint have adopted laws, regulations and policies addressing climate change and restricting GHG emissions from fossil fuel burning systems. For additional information about climate change regulations affecting us, See Item 1 Business - Government Regulations for a summary of certain laws, regulations and policies adopted by states and municipalities in our operating footprint addressing climate change and/or restricting GHG emissions from fossil-fuel burning systems. The federal, state and local climate change regulatory landscape is highly complex and rapidly and continuously evolving. At this time, while we cannot predict whether, when, which, or in what form climate change legislation provisions and GHG emission restrictions may be enacted and what the impact of any such legislation or standards\nmay have on our business, financial conditions or operations in the future, these measures could have a negative impact on our business over time or in the future.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by environmental regulations, and regulatory costs.\nOur business is subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations related to environmental and other matters. Such laws and regulations have become increasingly stringent over time. We may experience increased costs due to stricter pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from noncompliance with operating or other regulatory permits. New regulations, such as those relating to underground storage, transportation, and delivery of the products that we sell, might adversely impact operations or make them more costly. In addition, there are environmental risks inherently associated with home heating oil operations, such as the risks of accidental releases or spills. We have incurred and continue to incur costs to remediate soil and groundwater contamination at some of our locations. We cannot be sure that we have identified all such contamination, that we know the full extent of our obligations with respect to contamination of which we are aware, or that we will not become responsible for additional contamination not yet discovered. It is possible that material costs and liabilities will be incurred, including those relating to claims for damages to property and persons and the environment. For additional information about environmental and other regulations we are subject to, see Item 1 Business-Governmental Regulations.\nWe are subject to operating and litigation risks that could adversely affect our operating results whether or not covered by insurance.\nOur operations are subject to all operating hazards and risks normally incidental to handling, storing, transporting and otherwise providing customers with our products such as natural disasters, adverse weather, accidents, fires, explosions, hazardous material releases, mechanical failures and other events beyond our control. If any of these events were to occur, we could incur substantial losses because of personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, and pollution or other environmental damage resulting in curtailment or suspension of our related operations. As a result, we may be a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable.\nAs we self-insure workers compensation, automobile general liability and medical claims up to pre-established limits, we establish liabilities based upon expectations as to what our ultimate liability will be for claims based on our historical factors. We evaluate on an annual basis the potential for changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries.\nOther than matters for which we self-insure, we maintain insurance policies with insurers in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent. However, there can be no assurance that the ultimate settlement of these claims will not differ materially from the assumptions used to calculate the liabilities or that the insurance we maintain will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations.\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. Changes to existing tax laws or the enactment of future reform legislation could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nRisks Related to Information Technology and Cybersecurity\nWe depend on the use of information technology systems that have been and may in the future be a target of cyber-attacks.\nWe rely on multiple information technology systems and networks that are maintained internally and by third-party vendors, and their failure or breach could significantly impede operations. In addition, our systems and networks, as well as those of our vendors, banks and counterparties, may receive and store personal or proprietary information in connection with human resources operations, customer offerings, and other aspects of our business. A cyber-attack or material network breach in the security of these systems could include the exfiltration, or other unauthorized access or disclosure, of proprietary information or employee and customer information, as well as disrupt our operations or damage our information technology infrastructure or those of third parties.\nFor example, in July 2021, we detected a security incident that resulted in the encryption of certain of our information technology systems. Promptly upon discovery of the incident, we launched an investigation with the assistance of an outside cybersecurity firm, notified law enforcement, and took steps to address the incident and restore full operations. As a result of our investigation of the incident, we do not believe any personal information belonging to customers was involved. However, we believe that an unauthorized third party exfiltrated and/or accessed certain employee personal identifying information (PII) and/or protected health information (PHI) relating to employee health insurance plans and human resources information, residing on some of the affected systems. We were able to continue to serve our customers without interruption. We do not believe that this incident had a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results. However, we cannot be certain that that similar cyber-attacks will not occur in the future. Any future cyber-attacks or incidents may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results.\nCyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, and sophistication and intensity. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to disrupt, information technology systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement security measures that would prevent them. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period. In addition, the information technology controls or legacy third party providers of an acquired business may be inadequate to prevent a future cyber-attack, unauthorized access or other data security breaches. If another cyber-attack were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and increase our operating and capital costs, which could reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution. To the extent that a future cyber-attack, security breach or other such disruption results in a loss or damage to the Companys data, or the disclosure of PII, PHI or other personal or proprietary information, including customer or employee information, it could cause significant damage to the Companys reputation, affect relationships with its customers, vendors and employees, lead to claims against the Company, and ultimately harm our business. In addition, we may be required to incur additional costs to mitigate, remediate and protect against damage caused by cyber-attacks, security breaches or other such disruptions in the future. We have paid and may continue to pay significantly higher insurance premiums to maintain cyber insurance coverage, and even if we are able to maintain cyber insurance coverage, it may not be sufficient in amounts and scope to cover all harm sustained by the Company in any future cyber-attack or other data security incident.\nRisks Related to Our Workforce\nOur inability to identify, hire and retain qualified individuals for our workforce could slow our growth and adversely impact our ability to operate our business.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees to meet the needs of our business. We have experienced and may continue to experience shortages of qualified individuals to fill available positions. We place a heavy emphasis on the qualification and training of our personnel and spend a significant amount of time and money on training our team members. Any inability to recruit and retain qualified individuals may result in higher turnover and increased labor costs, could compromise the quality of our service, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our workforce is unionized, and we may face labor actions that could disrupt our operations or lead to higher labor costs and adversely affect our business.\nAs of September 30, 2023, approximately 44% of our employees were covered under 62 different collective bargaining agreements. As a result, we are usually involved in union negotiations with several local bargaining units at any given time. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate the terms of any expired or expiring agreement on terms satisfactory to us. Although we consider our relations with our employees to be generally satisfactory, we may experience strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns in the future. If our unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, our non-union employees may become subject to labor organizing efforts. If any of our current non-union facilities were to unionize, we could incur increased risk of work stoppages and potentially higher labor costs.\nOur obligation to fund multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute may have an adverse impact on us.\nWe participate in a number of multi-employer pension plans for current and former union employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. The risks of participating in multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans in that assets contributed are pooled and may be used to provide benefits to current and former employees of other participating employers. Several factors could require us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans, including the funding status of the plan, unfavorable investment performance, insolvency or withdrawal of participating employers, changes in demographics and increased benefits to participants. Several of these multi-employer plans to which we contribute are underfunded, meaning that the value of such plans assets are less than the actuarial value of the plans benefit obligations.\nWe may be subject to additional liabilities imposed by law as a result of our participation in multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. Various Federal laws impose certain liabilities upon an employer who is a contributor to a multi-employer pension plan if the employer withdraws from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal, potentially including an allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits in the plan for all plan participants, not just our retirees. Accordingly, we could be assessed our share of unfunded liabilities should we terminate participation in these plans, or should there be a mass withdrawal from these plans, or if the plans become insolvent or otherwise terminate.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Units\nConflicts of interest have arisen and could arise in the future.\nConflicts of interest have arisen and could arise in the future as a result of relationships between the general partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us or any of our limited partners, on the other hand. As a result of these conflicts, the general partner may favor its own interests and those of its affiliates over the interests of the unitholders. The nature of these conflicts is ongoing and includes the following considerations:\nThe general partners affiliates are not prohibited from engaging in other business or activities, including direct competition with us.\nThe general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, capital expenditures, distributions to unitholders, unit repurchases, and our capital structure, each of which can impact the amount of cash, if any, available for distribution to unitholders, and available to pay principal and interest on debt and the amount of incentive distributions payable in respect of the general partner units.\nThe general partner decides whether to retain its counsel or engage separate counsel to perform services for us.\nUnitholders are deemed to have consented to some actions and conflicts of interest under the Partnership Agreement that might otherwise be deemed a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law.\nUnder the Partnership Agreement, the general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties in addition to the Company in resolving conflicts of interest, thereby limiting its fiduciary duty to the unitholders.\nThe general partner determines whether to issue additional units or other of our securities.\nThe general partner is not restricted from causing us to pay the general partner or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf.\nCash distributions (if any) are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with performance and reserve requirements.\nDistributions of available cash, if any, by us to unitholders will depend on the amount of cash generated, and distributions may fluctuate based on our performance. The actual amount of cash that is available for distribution will depend upon numerous factors, many of which are out of our control.\nOur Credit Agreement imposes restrictions on our ability to pay distributions to unitholders, including the need to maintain certain covenants. (See the sixth amended and restated credit agreement and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Long-Term Debt and Bank Facility Borrowings).\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, then we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential unitholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common units.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. We may experience difficulties in implementing effective internal controls as part of our integration of acquisitions from private companies, which are not subject to the internal control requirements imposed on public companies. If we are unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or if the businesses we acquire have ineffective internal controls, our operating results could be harmed or we may fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls over financial reporting could cause our unitholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common units.\nOur unitholder rights plan may discourage potential acquirers of the Company.\nIn March 2023, we adopted a unitholder rights plan, which provides, among other things, that when specified events occur, our unitholders will be entitled to purchase additional common units. The unitholders rights plan will expire on March 24, 2028, unless further extended. The common unit purchase rights are triggered ten days after the date of a public announcement that a person or group acting in concert has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our outstanding common units. The common unit purchase rights would cause significant dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the Company on terms that are not approved by the board of directors of the general partner. These provisions, either alone or in combination with each other, give our general partner a substantial ability to influence the outcome of a proposed acquisition of the Company. These provisions would apply even if an acquisition or other significant corporate transaction was considered beneficial by some of our unitholders.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial debt and other financial obligations could impair our financial condition and our ability to obtain additional financing and have a material adverse effect on us if we fail to meet our financial and other obligations.\nAt September 30, 2023, we had outstanding under our sixth amended and restated revolving credit facility agreement a $148.5 million term loan, $0.2 million under the revolver portion of the agreement, $3.2 million of letters of credit, $0.1 million hedge positions were secured under the credit agreement and our availability was $202.1 million. (See the sixth amended and restated credit agreement and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Long-Term Debt and Bank Facility Borrowings). Our debt is often substantially higher during the heating season as we access our revolving credit facilities to finance accounts receivable and inventory balances. For example, our borrowings under the revolver peaked at $125.6 million during the fiscal 2023 heating season. Our substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations could:\nimpair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, unit repurchases, paying distributions or general partnership purposes;\nhave a material adverse effect on us if we fail to comply with financial and affirmative and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements and an event of default occurs that is not cured or waived;\nexpose us to interest rate risk because certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\nIf we are unable to meet our debt service obligations and other financial obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness and other financial transactions, seek additional equity capital or sell our assets. We might then be unable to obtain such financing or capital or sell our assets on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nWe are not required to accumulate cash for the purpose of meeting our future obligations to our lenders, which may limit the cash available to service the final payment due on the term loan outstanding under our Credit Agreement.\nSubject to the limitations on restricted payments that are contained in our Credit Agreement, we are not required to accumulate cash for the purpose of meeting our future obligations to our lenders. As a result, we may be required to refinance the final payment of our term loan, which is expected to be $82.6 million. Our ability to refinance the term loan will depend upon our future results of operation and financial condition as well as developments in the capital markets. Our general partner will determine the future use of our cash resources and has broad discretion in determining such uses and in establishing reserves for such uses, which may include but are not limited to, complying with the terms of any of our agreements or obligations providing for distributions of cash to our unitholders in accordance with the requirements of our Partnership Agreement, providing for future capital expenditures and other payments deemed by our general partner to be necessary or advisable, including to make acquisitions, and repurchasing common units. Depending on the timing and amount of our use of cash, this could significantly reduce the cash available to us in subsequent periods to make payments on borrowings under our Credit Agreement.\nRestrictive covenants in our Credit Agreement may reduce our operating flexibility.\nOur Credit Agreement contains various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness, make distributions to our unitholders, purchase or redeem our outstanding equity interests, sell assets, and engage in other lines of business.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make capital expenditures, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. Our Credit Agreement also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial conditions. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and conditions can be affected by events beyond our control, such as weather conditions and general economic conditions. Accordingly, we may be unable to meet those ratios and conditions.\nAny breach of any of these covenants, failure to meet any of these ratios or conditions, or occurrence of a change of control would result in a default under the terms of the Credit Agreement and cause the amounts borrowed to become immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or liquidation proceeding or proceed against the collateral, if any. If the lenders of our indebtedness or other financial obligations accelerate the repayment of borrowings or other amounts owed, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness or other financial obligations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nRecessionary Economic Conditions and rapid inflation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, availability of capital markets, consumer spending rates, unemployment rates, rising health care costs, energy availability and costs, the negative impacts caused by global conflicts, pandemics and public health crises, and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions, including rapid increases in inflation, have impacted, and may again impact, our business and operations in a variety of ways. Uncertainty about economic conditions poses a risk as our customers may reduce or postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on the demand for our products and services and could lead to increased conservation, as we have seen certain of our customers seek lower cost providers. In addition, recessionary economic conditions could negatively impact the spending and financial viability of our customers. As a result, we could experience an increase in bad debts from financially distressed customers, which would have a negative effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the delivery of our products and services could adversely impact our business.\nA disruption within our supply chain network due to unforeseen events beyond our control could adversely affect our ability to deliver our products and services in a timely manner, cause an increase in wholesale prices and a decrease in supply, lost sales, customer attrition, increased supply chain costs, or damage to our reputation. Such disruptions may result from weather-related events; natural disasters; international trade disputes or trade policy changes or restrictions; tariffs or import-related taxes; third-party strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages or slowdowns; shortages of supply chain labor, including truck drivers; shipping capacity constraints, including shortages of related equipment; third-party contract disputes; supply or shipping interruptions or costs; military conflicts; acts of terrorism; public health issues, including pandemics and related shut-downs, re-openings, or other actions by the government; civil unrest; or other factors beyond our control. Disruptions to our supply chain due to any of the factors listed above could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition.\nIf service at our third-party terminals, the common carrier pipelines used or the barge companies we hire to move product is interrupted, our operations would be adversely affected.\nThe products that we sell are transported in either barge, pipeline or in truckload quantities to third-party terminals where we have contracts to temporarily store our products. Any significant interruption in the service of these third-party terminals, the common carrier pipelines used or the barge companies that we hire to move product would adversely affect our ability to obtain product.\nEnergy efficiency and new technology may reduce the demand for our products and adversely affect our operating results.\nIncreased conservation and technological advances, including installation of improved insulation and the development of more efficient furnaces and other heating devices, such as electric heat pumps, have adversely affected the demand for our products by retail customers. Future conservation measures or technological advances in heating, conservation, energy generation or other devices might reduce demand and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe risk of global terrorism, political unrest and war may adversely affect the economy and the price and availability of the products that we sell and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks, political unrest and war may adversely impact the price and availability of the products that we sell, our results of operations, our ability to raise debt or equity capital and our future growth. As discussed above under Risk Factors - Increases in wholesale product costs may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity,\" we believe that the war in Ukraine and other geopolitical forces have caused a sustained period of high wholesale product costs, which has impacted our profit margins and operating results. An act of terror could result in disruptions of crude oil supplies, markets and facilities, and the source of the products that we sell could be direct or indirect targets. Terrorist activity may also hinder our ability to transport our products if our normal means of transportation become damaged as a result of an attack. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism could also affect our ability to raise capital. Terrorist activity could likely lead to increased volatility in the prices of our products. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nWe currently provide services to our customers in the United States in twelve states and the District of Columbia, ranging from Massachusetts to Maryland from 40 principal operating locations and 78 depots, 55 of which are owned and 63 of which are leased. As of September 30, 2023, we had a fleet of approximately 1,118 truck and transport vehicles, the majority of which were owned, 1,189 service and 389 support vehicles, the majority of which were leased. Our obligations under our Credit Agreement are secured by liens and mortgages on substantially all of the Companys and subsidiaries real and personal property. ITEM 3.

Available Cash, as defined in our Partnership Agreement, generally means all cash on hand at the end of the relevant fiscal quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by the Board of Directors of our general partner in its reasonable discretion for future cash requirements. These reserves are established for the proper conduct of our business (including reserves for future capital expenditures) for minimum quarterly distributions during the next four quarters and to comply with applicable laws and the terms of any debt agreements or other agreement to which we are subject. The Board of Directors of our general partner reviews the level of Available Cash each quarter based upon information provided by management.\nAccording to the terms of our Partnership Agreement, minimum quarterly distributions on the common units accrue at the rate of $0.0675 per quarter ($0.27 on an annual basis). The information concerning restrictions on distributions required by Item 5 of this Report is incorporated by reference to Note 4 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements - Quarterly Distribution of Available Cash. The Credit Agreement imposes certain restrictions on our ability to pay distributions to unitholders. In order to pay any distributions to unitholders or repurchase Common Units, the Company must maintain Availability (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of $60 million, 15% of the facility size of $400 million (assuming the non-seasonal aggregate commitment is in effect), on a historical pro forma and forward-looking basis, and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.0 through February 27, 2024 and 1.15 thereafter measured as of the date of repurchase or distribution. (See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Long-Term Debt and Bank Facility Borrowings).\nOn October 10, 2023, we declared a quarterly distribution of $0.1625 per unit, or $0.65 per unit on an annualized basis, on all Common Units with respect to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, paid on October 30, 2023, to holders of record on October 20, 2023. The amount of distributions in excess of the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.0675, were distributed in accordance with our Partnership Agreement, subject to management incentive compensation plan. As a result, $5.8 million was paid to the Common Unit holders, $0.3 million to the general partner unit holders (including $0.3 million of incentive distribution as provided in our Partnership Agreement) and $0.3 million to management pursuant to the management incentive compensation plan which provides for certain members of management to receive incentive distributions that would otherwise be payable to the General Partner.\nCommon Unit Repurchase Plans and Retirement\nNote 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements concerning the Companys repurchase of Common Units during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 is incorporated into this Item 5 by reference. ITEM 6. (RESERVED) ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nStatement Regarding Forward-Looking Disclosure\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K (this Report) includes forward-looking statements which represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events that involve risks and uncertainties, including the impact of geopolitical events on wholesale product cost volatility, the price and supply of the products that we sell, our ability to purchase sufficient quantities of product to meet our customers needs, rapid increases in levels of inflation, the consumption patterns of our customers, our ability to obtain satisfactory gross profit margins, the effect of weather conditions on our financial performance, our ability to obtain new customers and retain existing customers, our ability to make strategic acquisitions, the impact of litigation, natural gas conversions and electrification of heating systems, pandemic and future global health pandemics, recessionary economic conditions, future union relations and the outcome of current and future union negotiations, the impact of current and future governmental regulations, including climate change, environmental, health, and safety regulations, the ability to attract and retain employees, customer credit worthiness, counterparty credit worthiness, marketing plans, cyber-attacks, global supply chain issues, labor shortages and new technology, including alternative methods for heating and cooling residences.

Unless otherwise required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise after the date of this Report.\nLiquid Product Price Volatility\nVolatility, which is reflected in the wholesale price of liquid products, including home heating oil, propane and motor fuels, has a larger impact on our business when prices rise. Home heating oil consumers are sensitive to heating cost increases, and this often leads to customer conservation and increased gross customer losses. As a commodity, the price of home heating oil is generally impacted by many factors, including economic and geopolitical forces and is closely linked to the price of diesel fuel. The volatility in the wholesale cost of diesel fuel as measured by the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2019, through 2023, on a quarterly basis, is illustrated in the following chart (price per gallon):\nFiscal 2023 (a)\nFiscal 2022\nFiscal 2021\nFiscal 2020\nFiscal 2019\nQuarter Ended\nLow\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nDecember 31\n$\n2.78\n$\n4.55\n$\n2.06\n$\n2.59\n$\n1.08\n$\n1.51\n$\n1.86\n$\n2.05\n$\n1.66\n$\n2.44\nMarch 31\n2.61\n3.55\n2.36\n4.44\n1.46\n1.97\n0.95\n2.06\n1.70\n2.04\nJune 30\n2.23\n2.73\n3.27\n5.14\n1.77\n2.16\n0.61\n1.22\n1.78\n2.12\nSeptember 30\n2.38\n3.48\n3.13\n4.01\n1.91\n2.34\n1.08\n1.28\n1.75\n2.08\na)On November 30, 2023, the NYMEX ultra low sulfur diesel contract closed at $2.83 per gallon.\nIncome Taxes\nBook versus Tax Deductions\nThe amount of cash flow generated in any given year depends upon a variety of factors including the amount of cash income taxes required, which will increase as depreciation and amortization decreases. The amount of depreciation and amortization that we deduct for book (i.e., financial reporting) purposes will differ from the amount\nthat the Company can deduct for Federal tax purposes. The table below compares the estimated depreciation and amortization for book purposes to the amount that we expect to deduct for Federal tax purposes, based on currently owned assets. While we file our tax returns based on a calendar year, the amounts below are based on our September 30 fiscal year, and the tax amounts include any 100% bonus depreciation available for fixed assets purchased. However, this table does not include any forecast of future annual capital purchases.\nEstimated Depreciation and Amortization Expense\n(in thousands) Fiscal Year\nBook\nTax\n$\n33,434\n$\n32,739\n28,251\n25,263\n23,566\n22,261\n19,182\n21,406\n17,122\n19,534\n13,494\n18,247\nWeather Hedge Contracts\nWeather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for home heating oil and propane because certain customers depend on these products principally for space heating purposes. Actual weather conditions may vary substantially from year to year, significantly affecting the Companys financial performance. To partially mitigate the adverse effect of warm weather on cash flow, we have used weather hedging contracts for a number of years with several providers.\nUnder these contracts, we are entitled to a payment if the total number of degree days within the hedge period is less than the applicable Payment Thresholds, or strikes. For fiscal 2022 and 2023 we entered into weather hedging contracts under which we were entitled to an annual payment capped at $12.5 million if degree days were less than the Payment Threshold and we were obligated to make an annual payment capped at $5.0 million if degree days exceed the Payment Threshold. The hedge period ran from November 1 through March 31, taken as a whole, for each respective fiscal year. The temperatures experienced during the hedge period through March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 were warmer than the Payment Thresholds in our weather hedge contracts. As a result for the fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company reduced delivery and branch expenses for the gains realized under those contracts of $12.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The amounts were received in full in April 2023 and April 2022, respectively.\nFor fiscal 2024, the Company entered into a weather hedge contract with the similar hedge period described above. The maximum that the Company can receive is $12.5 million annually and the Company has no obligation to pay the counterparty beyond the initial premium should degree days exceed the Payment Threshold.\nPer Gallon Gross Profit Margins\nWe believe home heating oil and propane margins should be evaluated on a cents per gallon basis (before the effects of increases or decreases in the fair value of derivative instruments), as we believe that such per gallon margins are best at showing profit trends in the underlying business, without the impact of non-cash changes in the market value of hedges before the settlement of the underlying transaction.\nA significant portion of our home heating oil volume is sold to individual customers under an arrangement pre-establishing a ceiling price or fixed price for home heating oil over a set period of time, generally twelve to twenty-four months (price-protected customers). When these price-protected customers agree to purchase home heating oil from us for the next heating season, we purchase option contracts, swaps and futures contracts for a substantial majority of the heating oil that we expect to sell to these customers. The amount of home heating oil volume that we hedge per price-protected customer is based upon the estimated fuel consumption per average customer per month. In the event that the actual usage exceeds the amount of the hedged volume on a monthly basis, we may be required to obtain additional volume at unfavorable costs. In addition, should actual usage in any month be less than the hedged volume, our hedging costs and losses could be greater, thus reducing expected margins.\nDerivatives\nFASB ASC 815-10-05 Derivatives and Hedging requires that derivative instruments be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. To the extent our interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are effective, as defined under this guidance, changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the forecasted hedged item is recognized in earnings. We have elected not to designate our commodity derivative instruments as hedging instruments under this guidance and, as a result, the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in our statement of operations. Therefore, we experience volatility in earnings as outstanding derivative instruments are marked to market and non-cash gains and losses are recorded prior to the sale of the commodity to the customer. The volatility in any given period related to unrealized non-cash gains or losses on derivative instruments can be significant to our overall results. However, we ultimately expect those gains and losses to be offset by the cost of product when purchased.\nCustomer Attrition\nWe measure net customer attrition on an ongoing basis for our full service residential and commercial home heating oil and propane customers. Net customer attrition is the difference between gross customer losses and customers added through marketing efforts. Customers added through acquisitions are not included in the calculation of gross customer gains. However, additional customers that are obtained through marketing efforts or lost at newly acquired businesses are included in these calculations from the point of closing going forward. Customer attrition percentage calculations include customers added through acquisitions in the denominators of the calculations on a weighted average basis from the closing date. Gross customer losses are the result of a number of factors, including price competition, move-outs, credit losses, conversions to natural gas and service disruptions. When a customer moves out of an existing home, we count the move out as a loss, and if we are successful in signing up the new homeowner, the move in is treated as a gain. The impact of certain geopolitical forces on liquid product prices could increase future attrition due to higher losses from credit related issues.\nCustomer gains and losses of home heating oil and propane customers\nFiscal Year Ended\nNet\nNet\nNet\nGross Customer\nGains /\nGross Customer\nGains /\nGross Customer\nGains /\nGains\nLosses\n(Attrition)\nGains\nLosses\n(Attrition)\nGains\nLosses\n(Attrition)\nFirst Quarter\n26,500\n19,500\n7,000\n19,800\n18,500\n1,300\n19,100\n19,900\n(800\n)\nSecond Quarter\n9,300\n18,100\n(8,800\n)\n12,700\n17,300\n(4,600\n)\n12,600\n17,800\n(5,200\n)\nThird Quarter\n5,300\n12,600\n(7,300\n)\n6,400\n14,300\n(7,900\n)\n6,700\n12,300\n(5,600\n)\nFourth Quarter\n8,900\n14,600\n(5,700\n)\n11,400\n15,800\n(4,400\n)\n9,500\n14,900\n(5,400\n)\nTotal\n50,000\n64,800\n(14,800\n)\n50,300\n65,900\n(15,600\n)\n47,900\n64,900\n(17,000\n)\nCustomer gains (attrition) as a percentage of home heating oil and propane customer base\nFiscal Year Ended\nGross Customer\nNet\nGross Customer\nNet\nGross Customer\nNet\nGains\nLosses\nGains /\n(Attrition)\nGains\nLosses\nGains /\n(Attrition)\nGains\nLosses\nGains /\n(Attrition)\nFirst Quarter\n6.4\n%\n4.7\n%\n1.7\n%\n4.7\n%\n4.4\n%\n0.3\n%\n4.4\n%\n4.6\n%\n(0.2\n)%\nSecond Quarter\n2.2\n%\n4.3\n%\n(2.1\n)%\n3.0\n%\n4.1\n%\n(1.1\n)%\n2.9\n%\n4.1\n%\n(1.2\n)%\nThird Quarter\n1.3\n%\n3.1\n%\n(1.8\n)%\n1.5\n%\n3.4\n%\n(1.9\n)%\n1.3\n%\n2.6\n%\n(1.3\n)%\nFourth Quarter\n2.1\n%\n3.5\n%\n(1.4\n)%\n2.7\n%\n3.7\n%\n(1.0\n)%\n2.1\n%\n3.3\n%\n(1.2\n)%\nTotal\n12.0\n%\n15.6\n%\n(3.6\n)%\n11.9\n%\n15.6\n%\n(3.7\n)%\n10.7\n%\n14.6\n%\n(3.9\n)%\nFor fiscal 2023, the Company lost 14,800 accounts (net), or 3.6%, of its home heating oil and propane customer base, compared to 15,600 accounts lost (net), or 3.7%, of its home heating oil and propane customer base, during fiscal 2022. Gross customer gains were 300 lower than the prior years comparable period, and gross customer losses were 1,100 accounts lower primarily due to reduction in the number of customer relocations.\nFor fiscal 2022, the Company lost 15,600 accounts (net), or 3.7%, of its home heating oil and propane customer base, compared to 17,000 accounts lost (net), or 3.9%, of its home heating oil and propane customer base, during fiscal 2021. Gross customer gains were 2,400 higher than the prior years comparable period, and gross customer losses were 1,000 accounts higher primarily due to product prices, customer credit cancellations and fuel conversions.\nDuring fiscal 2023, we estimate that we lost (1.6%) of our home heating oil and propane accounts to natural gas and electricity conversions versus (1.5%) for fiscal 2022 and (1.1%) for fiscal 2021. Losses to natural gas and electricity in our footprint for the heating oil and propane industry could be greater or less than the Companys estimates.\nAcquisitions\nThe timing of acquisitions and the types of products sold by acquired companies impact year-over-year comparisons. Subsequent to September 30, 2023 the Company acquired two heating oil businesses for approximately $2.5 million. During fiscal 2023, the Company acquired two heating oil businesses and one propane business for approximately $19.8 million. During fiscal 2022, the Company acquired five heating oil businesses for approximately $15.6 million. The following tables detail the Companys acquisition activity and the associated volume sold during the 12-month period prior to the date of acquisition.\n(in thousands of gallons)\nFiscal 2024 Acquisitions\nAcquisition Number\nMonth of Acquisition\nHome Heating Oil and Propane\nMotor Fuel and Other Petroleum Products\nTotal\nNovember\n1,210\n1,432\nNovember\n1,254\n2,095\n2,686\n(in thousands of gallons)\nFiscal 2023 Acquisitions\nAcquisition Number\nMonth of Acquisition\nHome Heating Oil and Propane\nMotor Fuel and Other Petroleum Products\nTotal\nOctober\nNovember\n-\nAugust\n1,447\n-\n1,447\n2,497\n2,900\n(in thousands of gallons)\nFiscal 2022 Acquisitions\nAcquisition Number\nMonth of Acquisition\nHome Heating Oil and Propane\nMotor Fuel and Other Petroleum Products\nTotal\nOctober\nDecember\n-\nDecember\n1,768\n-\n1,768\nMarch\n1,225\n1,671\nApril\n3,678\n3,844\n7,849\n8,509\nSale of Certain Assets\nIn October 2022 we sold certain assets, which included a customer list of approximately 6,500 customers, for $2.7 million (including a deferred purchase price of $0.5 million). The following table details sales generated from the assets sold:\nYears Ended September 30,\n(in thousands)\nVolume:\nHome heating oil and propane\n2,147\n2,163\n2,345\nMotor fuel and other petroleum products\nSales:\nPetroleum products\n$\n9,355\n$\n6,102\n$\n6,524\nInstallations and services\n1,323\n1,384\n1,292\nTotal Sales\n$\n10,678\n$\n7,486\n$\n7,816\nProtected Price Account Renewals\nA substantial majority of the Companys price-protected customers have agreements with us that are subject to annual renewal in the period between April and November of each fiscal year. If a significant number of these customers elect not to renew their price-protected agreements with us and do not continue as our customers under a variable price-plan, the Companys near term profitability, liquidity and cash flow will be adversely impacted.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion of the consolidated results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with the historical financial and operating data and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023\nCompared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2022\nVolume\nFor fiscal 2023, the retail volume of home heating oil and propane sold decreased by 36.9 million gallons, or 12.5%, to 259.2 million gallons, compared to 296.1 million gallons for fiscal 2022. For those locations where we had existing operations during both periods, which we sometimes refer to as the base business (i.e., excluding acquisitions), temperatures (measured on a heating degree day basis) for fiscal 2023 were the third warmest in the last 123 years in the New York City metropolitan area. For fiscal 2023 temperatures were 7.7% warmer than fiscal 2022 and 16.3% warmer than normal, as reported by NOAA. For fiscal 2023, net customer attrition for the base business was 3.5%. The impact of fuel conservation, along with any period-to-period differences in delivery scheduling, the timing of accounts added or lost during the fiscal years, equipment efficiency, and other volume variances not otherwise described, are included in the chart below under the heading Other. An analysis of the change in the retail volume of home heating oil and propane, which is based on managements estimates, sampling, and other mathematical calculations and certain assumptions, is found below:\nHeating Oil\n(in millions of gallons)\nand Propane\nVolume - Fiscal 2022\n296.1\nNet customer attrition\n(12.1\n)\nImpact of warmer temperatures\n(20.7\n)\nAcquisitions\n3.5\nSale of certain assets\n(2.0\n)\nOther\n(5.6\n)\nChange\n(36.9\n)\nVolume - Fiscal 2023\n259.2\nThe following chart sets forth the percentage by volume of total home heating oil sold to residential variable-price customers, residential price-protected customers, and commercial/industrial/other customers for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022:\nTwelve Months Ended\nCustomers\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nResidential Variable\n42.1\n%\n44.0\n%\nResidential Price-Protected (Ceiling and Fixed Price)\n44.9\n%\n43.3\n%\nCommercial/Industrial/Other\n13.0\n%\n12.7\n%\nTotal\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\nVolume of motor fuel and other petroleum products sold decreased by 11.1 million gallons, or 7.4%, to 139.0 million gallons for fiscal 2023, compared to 150.1 million gallons for fiscal 2022.\nProduct Sales\nFor fiscal 2023, product sales decreased $47.6 million, or 2.8%, to $1,650.7 million, compared to $1,698.3 million in fiscal 2022, due to a decrease in total volume sold of 10.8% that was partially offset by a $0.2457 per gallon, or 8.8% increase in wholesale product cost. Product volumes and wholesale product cost include heating oil, propane, motor fuels and other petroleum products.\nInstallations and Services Sales\nFor fiscal 2023, installation and service sales decreased $6.2 million, or 2.0%, to $302.1 million, compared to $308.3 million for fiscal 2022, as a decrease in installation sales of $6.3 million primarily as a result of the warmer temperatures was partially offset by an increase in service revenue of $0.1 million.\nCost of Product\nFor fiscal 2023, cost of product decreased $35.4 million, or 2.9%, to $1,204.2 million, compared to $1,239.6 million for fiscal 2022, due to a decrease in total volume sold of 10.8% that was partially offset by a $0.2457 per gallon, or 8.8%, increase in wholesale product.\nGross Profit-Product\nThe table below calculates our per gallon margins and reconciles product gross profit for home heating oil and propane and motor fuel and other petroleum products. We believe the change in home heating oil and propane margins should be evaluated before the effects of increases or decreases in the fair value of derivative instruments, as we believe that realized per gallon margins should not include the impact of non-cash changes in the market value of hedges before the settlement of the underlying transaction. On that basis, home heating oil and propane margins for fiscal 2023 increased by $0.1561 per gallon, or 11.2%, to $1.5496 per gallon, from $1.3935 per gallon during fiscal 2022. We cannot assume that the per gallon margins realized during fiscal 2023 are sustainable for future periods. Product sales and cost of product include home heating oil, propane, motor fuel, other petroleum products and liquidated damages billings.\nTwelve Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023\nSeptember 30, 2022\nHome Heating Oil and Propane\nAmount\n(in millions)\nPer\nGallon\nAmount\n(in millions)\nPer\nGallon\nVolume\n259.2\n296.1\nSales\n$\n1,202.2\n$\n4.6384\n$\n1,170.6\n$\n3.9539\nCost\n$\n800.6\n$\n3.0888\n$\n758.0\n$\n2.5604\nGross Profit\n$\n401.6\n$\n1.5496\n$\n412.6\n$\n1.3935\nMotor Fuel and Other Petroleum Products\nAmount\n(in millions)\nPer\nGallon\nAmount\n(in millions)\nPer\nGallon\nVolume\n139.0\n150.1\nSales\n$\n448.5\n$\n3.2266\n$\n527.7\n$\n3.5156\nCost\n$\n403.6\n$\n2.9034\n$\n481.6\n$\n3.2083\nGross Profit\n$\n44.9\n$\n0.3232\n$\n46.1\n$\n0.3073\nTotal Product\nAmount\n(in millions)\nAmount\n(in millions)\nSales\n$\n1,650.7\n$\n1,698.3\nCost\n$\n1,204.2\n$\n1,239.6\nGross Profit\n$\n446.5\n$\n458.7\nFor fiscal 2023, total product gross profit was $446.5 million, which was $12.2 million, or 2.6%, lower than fiscal 2022, as a decrease in home heating oil and propane volume sold ($51.4 million) and a decrease in gross profit from other petroleum products ($1.2 million) was partially offset by the impact of an increase in home heating oil and propane margins ($40.4 million).\nCost of Installations and Services\nTotal installation costs for fiscal 2023 decreased by $3.6 million or 3.6%, to $95.2 million, compared to $98.8 million of installation costs for fiscal 2022, primarily due to lower installation revenues. Installation costs as a percentage of installation sales were 83.0% for fiscal 2023 and 81.6% for fiscal 2022. Gross profit from installations decreased by $2.7 million due in part to reduced installation sales primarily as a result of the warmer temperatures.\nService expense decreased by $1.2 million, or 0.7%, to $182.7 million for fiscal 2023, representing 97.5% of service sales, versus $183.9 million, or 98.2% of service sales, for fiscal 2022. A large proportion of our service expenses are incurred under fixed-fee prepaid service contract arrangements, therefore trends in service expenses may not directly correlate to trends in the related revenues. Gross profit from service increased $1.3 million.\nWe realized a combined gross profit from services and installations of $24.2 million for fiscal 2023 compared to a combined gross profit of $25.6 million for fiscal 2022, a $1.4 million decrease in profitability.\n(Increase) Decrease in the Fair Value of Derivative Instruments\nDuring fiscal 2023, the change in the fair value of derivative instruments resulted in a $2.0 million charge as an increase in the market value for unexpired hedges (a $3.9 million credit) was more than offset by a $5.9 million charge due to the expiration of certain hedged positions.\nDuring fiscal 2022, the change in the fair value of derivative instruments resulted in a $17.3 million charge as an increase in the market value for unexpired hedges (a $4.9 million credit) was more than offset by a $22.2 million charge due to the expiration of certain hedged positions.\nDelivery and Branch Expenses\nFor fiscal 2023, delivery and branch expenses increased $0.1 million to $353.6 million, compared to $353.5 million for fiscal 2022, due to a $9.3 million, or 2.7%, increase in expense within the base business and additional costs from acquisitions of $2.2 million, that was partially offset by an $11.4 million higher benefit recorded from the Companys weather hedge. The increase in base business expenses was driven by a $4.5 million increase in bad debts and credit card fees, a $2.6 million increase in insurance claims expense, a $2.0 million increase in vehicle fuel expenses due to higher diesel and gasoline costs, and $0.2 million of other net expense increases. Temperatures for the fiscal 2023 were 7.7% warmer fiscal 2022 and 16.3% warmer than normal, as reported by NOAA. For fiscal 2023 we recorded a benefit of $12.5 million under our weather hedge program that decreased delivery and branch expenses, versus a benefit of $1.1 million for fiscal 2022.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nFor fiscal 2023, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.2 million, or 0.8%, to $32.4 million, compared to $32.6 million for fiscal 2022, primarily due to lower amortization expense related to intangible assets that fully amortized in the prior fiscal year.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nFor fiscal 2023, general and administrative expenses increased $0.9 million, or 3.6%, to $25.8 million, compared to $24.9 million for fiscal 2022, due to a $1.6 million increase in the Company's frozen pension expense and $0.6 million of increases in salaries and benefits expenses that were partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in profit sharing expense and $0.5 million of other net expense decreases. The Company accrues approximately 6.0% of Adjusted EBITDA as defined in its profit sharing plan for distribution to its employees. This amount is payable when the Company achieves Adjusted EBITDA of at least 70% of the amount budgeted. The dollar amount of the profit sharing pool adjusts accordingly based on Adjusted EBITDA levels achieved.\nFinance Charge Income\nFor fiscal 2023, finance charge income increased by $1.0 million, or 22.4%, to $5.5 million compared to $4.5 million for fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher customer late payment charges.\nInterest Expense, Net\nFor fiscal 2023, net interest expense increased by $5.0 million, or 48.3%, to $15.5 million compared to $10.5 million for fiscal 2022. The year-over-year change was driven by an increase in the weighted average interest rate from 3.7% for fiscal 2022 to 6.5% for 2023. To hedge against rising interest rates, the Company utilizes interest rate swaps. At September 30, 2023, approximately 37% of borrowings under Star's variable-rate long term debt were not subject to interest rate increases.\nAmortization of Debt Issuance Costs\nFor fiscal 2023, amortization of debt issuance costs increased to $1.1 million from $1.0 million for fiscal 2022.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor fiscal 2023, the Companys income tax expense increased by $0.3 million to $14.0 million, from $13.7 million for fiscal 2022. The increase was driven primarily by permanent tax differences and other items which increased the effective income tax rate from 28.0% for fiscal 2022 to 30.4% for fiscal 2023 that was partially offset by a $3.1 million decline in income before income taxes.\nNet Income\nFor fiscal 2023, net income decreased $3.4 million, or 9.5%, to $31.9 million, primarily due a $13.5 million decrease in Adjusted EBITDA and a $5.0 million increase in interest expense, that was partially offset by a $15.3 million favorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nFor fiscal 2023, Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $13.5 million, or 12.2%, to $96.9 million compared to fiscal 2022, as a decrease in home heating oil and propane volume of 36.9 million gallons more than offset an increase in per gallon margins and an $11.4 million higher benefit recorded from the Companys weather hedge. Temperatures for the fiscal 2023 were the third warmest in the last 123 years in the New York City metropolitan area. Temperatures were 7.7% warmer than fiscal 2022 and 16.3% warmer than normal, as reported by NOAA. For fiscal 2023, the Company recorded a benefit of $12.5 million under its weather hedge program that decreased delivery and branch expenses, versus a benefit of $1.1 million for fiscal 2022.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (as an indicator of operating performance) or as an alternative to cash flow (as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations), but provide additional information for evaluating the Companys ability to make the Minimum Quarterly Distribution.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are calculated as follows:\nTwelve Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in thousands)\nNet income\n$\n31,945\n$\n35,288\nPlus:\nIncome tax expense\n13,984\n13,738\nAmortization of debt issuance cost\n1,084\nInterest expense, net\n15,532\n10,472\nDepreciation and amortization\n32,350\n32,598\nEBITDA (a)\n94,895\n93,051\n(Increase) / decrease in the fair value of derivative instruments\n1,977\n17,286\nAdjusted EBITDA (a)\n96,872\n110,337\nAdd / (subtract)\nIncome tax expense\n(13,984\n)\n(13,738\n)\nInterest expense, net\n(15,532\n)\n(10,472\n)\nProvision for losses on accounts receivable\n9,761\n5,411\nDecrease (increase) in receivables\n15,566\n(43,463\n)\nDecrease (increase) in inventories\n26,994\n(21,105\n)\nIncrease in customer credit balances\n17,585\n5,804\nChange in deferred taxes\n(501\n)\n(3,181\n)\nChange in other operating assets and liabilities\n(13,103\n)\n4,314\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n123,658\n$\n33,907\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(28,197\n)\n$\n(32,626\n)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n$\n(64,890\n)\n$\n8,572\n(a)EBITDA (Earnings from continuing operations before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings from continuing operations before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, (increase) decrease in the fair value of derivatives, other income (loss), net, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal charge, gain or loss on debt redemption, goodwill impairment, and other non-cash and non-operating charges) are non-GAAP financial measures that are used as supplemental financial measures by management and external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to assess:\nour compliance with certain financial covenants included in our debt agreements;\nour financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure, income taxes or historical cost basis;\nour operating performance and return on invested capital compared to those of other companies in the retail distribution of refined petroleum products, without regard to financing methods and capital structure;\nour ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness and to make distributions to our partners; and\nthe viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return of alternative investment opportunities.\nThe method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA may not be consistent with that of other companies, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA both have limitations as analytical tools and so should not be viewed in isolation and should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are:\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash used for capital expenditures;\nAlthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated or amortized often will have to be replaced and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash requirements for such replacements;\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital requirements;\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash necessary to make payments of interest or principal on our indebtedness; and\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash required to pay taxes.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2022\nCompared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2021\nSee Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations within the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 for the fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2021 comparative discussion.\nDISCUSSION OF CASH FLOWS\nWe use the indirect method to prepare our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows provided by operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that impact net income but do not result in actual cash receipts or payment during the period.\nOperating Activities\nDue to the seasonal nature of our business, cash is generally used in operations during the winter (our first and second fiscal quarters) as we require additional working capital to support the high volume of sales during this period, and cash is generally provided by operating activities during the spring and summer (our third and fourth quarters) when customer payments exceed the cost of deliveries.\nDuring fiscal 2023, cash provided by operating activities increased $89.8 million to $123.7 million, compared to $33.9 million provided by operating activities during fiscal 2022. The increase was driven by an increase in collection of trade receivables on a comparable basis (including accounts receivable and customer credit balance accounts) of $70.8 million and a $48.1 million decrease in cash required to purchase liquid product inventory on-hand at fiscal year end primarily driven by a reduction in cost of recent inventory purchases compared to the prior year. Further contributing to the increase was a $14.0 million decrease in net cash paid for certain hedge positions and $2.5 million increase in collection of derivative settlement receivables on a comparative basis. The increase was partially offset by a $25.9 million unfavorable change in accounts payable due to the pricing and timing of inventory purchases, an $11.7 million decrease in cash flows from operations, $5.2 million more in payroll taxes paid in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 versus the first fiscal quarter of 2022 as the result of deferring payment of certain payroll tax withholdings in first quarter of fiscal 2021 to the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2023, and $2.8 million of other net changes in working capital.\nDuring fiscal 2022, cash provided by operating activities decreased $35.0 million to $33.9 million, compared to $68.9 million provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021. Higher per gallon product costs drove an increase in receivables on a comparable basis (including accounts receivable, customer credit balance accounts and hedging settlement receivables) of $23.7 million. While accounts receivable were higher by $38.6 million, or 38.7%, during fiscal 2022 than fiscal 2021, days' sales outstanding remained fairly consistent with the prior year. The higher product cost also drove a $9.6 million increase in cash required to purchase liquid product inventory and contributed to a $4.0 million increase in net cash paid for certain hedge positions We also had a $8.8 million reduction in cash flows from operations. These cash flow changes were partially offset by a $5.1 million favorable change in accounts payable due to the pricing and timing of inventory purchases, $3.9 million less payroll tax payments ($7.8 million of fiscal 2020 payroll taxes deferred to fiscal 2021, partially offset by $3.9 million more in payroll taxes in the first fiscal quarter of 2022 versus the first fiscal quarter of 2021 as the result of deferring payment of certain payroll tax withholdings in first quarter of fiscal 2021 to the first quarter of fiscal 2023), and $2.1 million of other changes in working capital.\nInvesting Activities\nOur capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 totaled $9.0 million, as we invested in our fleet and other equipment ($5.5 million), refurbished certain physical plants ($1.4 million), expanded our propane operations ($1.0 million) and invested in computer hardware and software ($1.1 million).\nDuring fiscal 2023, we deposited $1.6 million, and invested another $0.9 million, into an irrevocable trust to secure certain liabilities for our captive insurance company. The cash deposited into the trust is shown on our balance sheet as captive insurance collateral and, correspondingly, reduced cash on our balance sheet. We believe that investments into the irrevocable trust will lower our letter of credit fees, increase interest income on invested cash balances, and provide us with certain tax advantages attributable to a captive insurance company.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company acquired one propane and two heating oil businesses for approximately $19.8 million (using $19.8 million in cash). The gross purchase price was allocated $10.4 million to intangible assets, $8.0 million to goodwill, $2.3 million to fixed assets, and reduced by $0.9 million in negative working capital.\nOur capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 totaled $18.7 million, as we invested in our fleet and other equipment ($7.7 million), refurbished certain physical plants ($3.4 million), purchased a strategic property ($3.0 million), expanded our propane operations ($2.7 million) and invested in computer hardware and software ($1.9 million).\nDuring fiscal 2022, we deposited $1.0 million, and invested another $0.8 million, into an irrevocable trust to secure certain liabilities for our captive insurance company.\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company acquired five heating oil businesses for approximately $15.6 million (using $13.1 million in cash and assuming $2.5 million of liabilities). The gross purchase price was allocated $7.3 million to intangible assets, $3.1 million to goodwill, $5.6 million to fixed assets, and reduced by $0.4 million in negative working capital.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring fiscal 2023, we repaid $16.5 million of our term loan, borrowed $125.6 million under our revolving credit facility and subsequently repaid $145.6 million. We also repurchased 0.5 million Common Units for $4.5 million in connection with our unit repurchase plan, and paid distributions of $22.5 million to our Common Unit holders and $1.2 million to our General Partner unit holders (including $1.16 million of incentive distributions as provided in our Partnership Agreement).\nDuring fiscal 2022, we refinanced our five-year term loan and the revolving credit facility with the execution of the sixth amended and restated revolving credit facility agreement. The $165 million of proceeds from the new term loan were used to repay the $95.9 million outstanding balance of the term loan and $69.1 million of the $200.2 million of revolving credit facility borrowings under the old credit facility. We also paid an additional $2.5 million of debt issuance costs, repaid an additional net balance of $119.4 million under our revolving credit facility, repaid an additional $14.6 million of our term loan, repurchased 3.0 million Common Units for $30.8 million in connection with our unit repurchase plan, and paid distributions of $22.1 million to our Common Unit holders and $1.1 million to our General Partner unit holders (including $1.0 million of incentive distributions as provided in our Partnership Agreement).\nFINANCING AND SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY\nLiquidity and Capital Resources Comparatives\nOur primary uses of liquidity are to provide funds for our working capital, capital expenditures, distributions on our units, acquisitions and unit repurchases. Our ability to provide funds for such uses depends on our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic, financial, geopolitical and business conditions, weather, the ability to collect current and future accounts receivable, the ability to pass on the full impact of high product costs to customers, the effects of high net customer attrition, conservation, inflation and other factors.\nCapital requirements, at least in the near term, are expected to be provided by cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand as of September 30, 2023 ($45.2 million) or a combination thereof. We believe that these cash sources will also be sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements in the longer-term. However, if they are not sufficient, we anticipate that working capital will be financed by our revolving credit facility, as discussed below, and from subsequent seasonal reductions in inventory and accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2023, we had accounts receivable of $114.1 million of which $69.4 million is due from residential customers and $44.7 million is due from commercial customers. Our ability to borrow from our bank group is based in part on the aging of these accounts receivable. If these balances do not meet the eligibility tests as found in our sixth amended and restated credit agreement, our ability to borrow will be reduced and our anticipated cash flow from operating activities will also be reduced. As of September 30, 2023, we had $0.2 million borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $148.5 million outstanding under our term loan, $3.2 million in letters of credit outstanding and $0.1 million hedge positions were secured under the credit agreement.\nUnder the terms of the sixth amended and restated credit agreement, we are required to maintain at all times a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.0 through February 27, 2024 and 1.15 thereafter if Availability (borrowing base less amounts borrowed and letters of credit issued) is less than 12.5% of the maximum facility size. We are also required to maintain a senior secured leverage ratio that cannot be more than 3.0 as of June 30th or September 30th, and no more than 5.5 as of December 31st or March 31st. As of September 30, 2023, Availability, as defined in the sixth amended and restated revolving credit facility agreement, was $202.1 million and we were in compliance with the financial covenants.\nMaintenance capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 are estimated to be approximately $11.5 million, excluding the capital requirements for leased fleet which we currently estimate to be $11.7 million. In addition, we plan to invest approximately $2.2 million in our propane operations. Distributions for fiscal 2024, at the current quarterly level of $0.1625 per unit, would result in aggregate payments of approximately $23.1 million to Common Unit\nholders, $1.3 million to our General Partner (including $1.2 million of incentive distribution as provided for in our Partnership Agreement) and $1.2 million to management pursuant to the management incentive compensation plan which provides for certain members of management to receive incentive distributions that would otherwise be payable to the General Partner. Under the terms of our sixth amended and restated revolving credit facility agreement, our term loan is repayable in quarterly payments of $4.1 million. We are also required to make an additional term loan repayments due to Excess Cash Flow of approximately $4.0 million in fiscal 2024 (see Note 13 - Long-Term Debt and Bank Facility Borrowings). We deposited $1.6 million in September 2023 for fiscal 2024 into our captive insurance company. Further, subject to any additional liquidity issues or concerns resulting from wholesale price volatility, we intend to continue to repurchase Common Units pursuant to our unit repurchase plan, as amended from time to time, and seek attractive acquisition opportunities within the Availability constraints of our revolving credit facility and funding resources.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no special purpose entities or off balance sheet debt.\nLong-term contractual obligations, except for our long-term debt and New England Teamsters and Trucking Industry Pension Fund withdrawal obligations and operating leases liabilities, are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. Non-cancelable purchase obligations are obligations we incur during the normal course of business, based on projected needs. The Company had no capital lease obligations as of September 30, 2023.\nThe table below summarizes the payment schedule of our contractual obligations at September 30, 2023 (in thousands):\nPayments Due by Fiscal Year\nTotal\nand 2026\nand 2028\nThereafter\nDebt obligations (a)\n$\n148,740\n$\n20,740\n$\n33,000\n$\n95,000\n$\n-\nOperating lease obligations (b)\n113,170\n23,271\n42,040\n27,051\n20,808\nPurchase obligations and other (c)\n61,463\n13,839\n13,040\n5,581\n29,003\nInterest obligations (d)\n31,133\n16,078\n11,850\n3,205\n-\n$\n354,506\n$\n73,928\n$\n99,930\n$\n130,837\n$\n49,811\n(a)Reflects payments due of debt existing as of September 30, 2023, considering the terms of our sixth amended and restated credit agreement.

The Company evaluates its policies and estimates on an on-going basis. A change in any of these critical accounting policies and estimates could have a material effect on the results of operations. The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements may differ based upon different estimates and assumptions. The Companys critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the following are our critical accounting policies and estimates:\nCritical Accounting Policy\nFair Values of Derivatives\nFASB ASC 815-10-05, Derivatives and Hedging, requires that derivative instruments be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The Company has elected not to designate its commodity derivative instruments as hedging instruments under this guidance, and therefore the change in fair value of those derivative instruments are recognized in our statement of operations.\nWe have established the fair value of our derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently evaluated them internally using established index prices and other sources. These values are based upon, among other things, future prices, volatility, time-to-maturity value and credit risk. The estimate of fair value we report in our financial statements changes as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions, or other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities\nWe currently self-insure a portion of workers compensation, auto, general liability and medical claims. We establish and periodically evaluate self-insurance liabilities based upon expectations as to what our ultimate liability may be for outstanding claims using developmental factors based upon historical claim experience, including frequency, severity, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions, supplemented with the support of a qualified third-party actuary. As of September 30, 2023, we had approximately $77.5 million of self-insurance liabilities. The ultimate resolution of these claims could differ materially from the assumptions used to calculate the self-insurance liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our bank credit facilities. We utilize these borrowings to meet our working capital needs.\nAt September 30, 2023, we had outstanding borrowings totaling $148.7 million, of which $93.2 million are subject to variable interest rates under our credit agreement. In the event that interest rates associated with this facility were to increase 100 basis points, the after tax impact on annual future cash flows would be a decrease of $0.6 million.\nWe regularly use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to market risk related to changes in the current and future market price of home heating oil. The value of market sensitive derivative instruments is subject to change as a result of movements in market prices. Sensitivity analysis is a technique used to evaluate the impact of hypothetical market value changes. Based on a hypothetical ten percent increase in the cost of product at September 30, 2023, the potential impact on our hedging activity would be to increase the fair market value of these outstanding derivatives by $17.3 million to a fair market value of $27.9 million; and conversely a hypothetical ten percent decrease in the cost of product would decrease the fair market value of these outstanding derivatives by $14.1 million to a fair market value of $(3.5) million. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe financial statements and financial statement schedules referred to in the index contained on page of this Report are incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.\nOur general partners chief executive officer and our chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2023. Based on that evaluation, such chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2023 at the reasonable level of assurance. For purposes of Rule 13a-15(e), the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commissions rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuers management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n(b) Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Under the supervision of management and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023 has been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included at Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n(c) Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the Companys most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n(d) Other.\nOur general partner and the Company believe that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Therefore, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide such reasonable assurances of achieving our desired control objectives, and the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of our general partner have concluded, as of September 30, 2023, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in achieving that level of reasonable assurance. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\n(a) N/A\n(b) Trading Plans. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, no director or Section 16 officer adopted or terminated any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements.\nITEM 9C.

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nOur Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, provides that our general partner, Kestrel Heat, shall conduct, direct and manage all activities of the Company. The limited liability company agreement of the general partner provides that the business of the general partner shall be managed by a Board of Directors. The responsibility of the Board is to supervise and direct the management of the Company in the interest and for the benefit of our unitholders. Among the Boards responsibilities is to regularly evaluate the performance and to approve the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and, with the advice of the Chief Executive Officer, regularly evaluate the performance and approve the compensation of key executives.\nAs a limited partnership that is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, we are not required to have a Compensation Committee. Since the Chairman of the general partner and the majority of the Board are not employees, the Board determined that it has adequate independence to act in the capacity of a Compensation Committee to establish and review the compensation our executive officers and directors. The Board is comprised of Paul A. Vermylen Jr. (Chairman), Jeffrey M. Woosnam (President and Chief Executive Officer), Daniel P. Donovan, Henry D. Babcock, David M. Bauer, C. Scott Baxter, Bryan H. Lawrence, and William P. Nicoletti.\nThroughout this Report, each person who served as chief executive officer (CEO) during fiscal 2023, each person who served as chief financial officer (CFO) during fiscal 2023 and the two other most highly compensated executive officers serving at September 30, 2023 (there being no other executive officers) are referred to as the named executive officers and are included in the Executive Compensation Table.\nIn this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, we address the compensation paid or awarded to Messrs. Woosnam, Ambury, Hammond and McDonald. We refer to these executive officers as our named executive officers.\nCompensation decisions for the above named executive officers were made by the Board of Directors of the Company.\nCompensation Philosophy and Policies\nThe primary objectives of our compensation program, including compensation of the named executive officers, are to attract and retain highly qualified officers, employees and directors and to reward individual contributions to our success. The Board of Directors considers the following policies in determining the compensation of the named executive officers:\ncompensation should be related to the performance of the individual executive and the performance measured against both financial and non-financial achievements;\ncompensation levels should be competitive to ensure that we will be able to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified executive officers; and\ncompensation should be related to improving unitholder value over time.\nCompensation Methodology\nThe elements of our compensation program for named executive officers are intended to provide a total incentive package designed to drive performance and reward contributions in support of business strategies at the Company. Subject to the terms of employment agreements that have been entered into with the named executive officers, all compensation determinations are discretionary and subject to the decision-making authority of the Board of Directors. We do not use benchmarking as a fixed criterion to determine compensation. Rather, after subjectively setting compensation based on the policies discussed above under Compensation Philosophy and Policies, we reviewed the compensation paid to officers holding similar positions at our peer group companies and certain information for privately held companies to obtain a general understanding of the reasonableness of base salaries and other compensation payable to our named executive officers. Our peer group of public companies was comprised of the following companies: Atmos Energy Corporation, Crestwood Equity Partners L.P., Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., Global Partners, L.P., New Jersey Resources Corporation, NuStar Energy L.P., Suburban Propane Partners, L.P. and Sunoco L.P. We chose these companies because they are engaged in the distribution of energy products like us.\nElements of Executive Compensation\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the principal components of compensation for the named executive officers were:\nbase salary;\nannual discretionary profit sharing allocation;\nmanagement incentive compensation plan; and\nretirement and health benefits.\nUnder our compensation structure, the mix of base salary, discretionary profit sharing allocation and long-term compensation provided to each executive officer varies depending on their position. The base salary for each executive officer is the only fixed component of compensation. All other compensation, including annual discretionary profit sharing allocation and long-term incentive compensation, is variable in nature.\nThe majority of the Companys compensation allocation is weighted towards base salary and annual discretionary profit sharing allocation. In addition, during fiscal 2023, an aggregate of $490,485 was paid to the named executive officers under the terms of the management incentive compensation plan and represented a small portion of the executive compensation that was paid to these officers. If we are successful in increasing the overall level of distributions payable to unitholders, the amounts payable to the named executive officers under the management incentive compensation plan should increase.\nWe believe that together all of our compensation components provide a balanced mix of fixed compensation and compensation that is contingent upon each executive officers individual performance and our overall performance. A goal of the compensation program is to provide executive officers with a reasonable level of security through base salary and benefits, while rewarding them through incentive compensation to achieve business objectives and create unitholder value over time. We believe that each of our compensation components is important in achieving this goal. Base salaries provide executives with a base level of monthly income and security. Annual discretionary profit sharing allocations and long-term incentive awards provide an incentive to our executives to achieve business objectives that increase our financial performance, which creates unitholder value through continuity of, and increases in, distributions and increases in the market value of the units. In addition, we want to ensure that our compensation programs are appropriately designed to encourage executive officer retention, which is accomplished through all of our compensation elements.\nBase Salary\nThe Board of Directors establishes base salaries for the named executive officers based on a number of factors, including:\nthe historical salaries for services rendered to the Company and responsibilities of the named executive officer;\nthe salaries of equivalent executive officers at our peer group companies and other data for our industry; and\nthe prevailing levels of compensation and cost of living in the location in which the named executive officer works.\nIn determining the initial base compensation payable to individual named executive officers when they are first hired by Star, our starting point is the historical compensation levels that we have paid to officers performing similar functions over the past few years. We also consider the level of experience and accomplishments of individual candidates and general labor market conditions, including the availability of candidates to fill a particular position. When we make adjustments to the base salaries of existing named executive officers, we review the individuals performance, the value each named executive officer brings to us and general labor market conditions.\nElements of individual performance considered, among others, without any specific weight given to each element, include business-related accomplishments during the year, difficulty and scope of responsibilities, effective leadership, experience, expected future contributions to the Company and difficulty of replacement. While base salary provides a base level of compensation intended to be competitive with the external market, the base salary for each named executive officer is determined on a subjective basis after consideration of these factors and is not based on target percentiles or other formal criteria. Although we believe that base salaries for our named executive officers are generally competitive with the external market, we do not use benchmarking as a fixed criterion to determine base compensation. Rather, after subjectively setting base salaries based on the above factors, we review the compensation paid to officers holding similar positions at our peer group companies to obtain a general understanding of the reasonableness of base salaries and other compensation payable to our named executive officers. We also take into account geographic differences for similar positions in the New York Metropolitan area. While cost of living is considered in determining annual increases, we do not typically provide full cost of living adjustments as salary increases are constrained by budgetary restrictions and the ability to fund the Companys current cash needs such as interest expense, maintenance capital, income taxes and distributions.\nProfit Sharing Allocations\nWe maintain a profit sharing pool for certain employees, including named executive officers, which is equal to approximately 6% of our earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding items affecting comparability (adjusted EBITDA) for the given fiscal year. The annual discretionary profit sharing allocations paid to the named executive officers are payable from this pool. The size of the pool fluctuates based upon upward or downwards changes in adjusted EBITDA and the size of an individual award to a named executive officer fluctuates based on the size of the profit sharing pool and the number of participants in the plan. Depending upon the size of the profit sharing pool, and the number of participants in the plan, the amount paid to the named executive officers could be more or less.\nThere are no set formulas for determining the amount payable to our named executive officers from the profit sharing plan. Factors considered by our CEO and the Board in determining the level of profit sharing allocations generally include, without assigning a particular weight to any factor:\nwhether or not we achieved certain budgeted goals for the year and any material shortfalls or superior performances relative to expectations. Under the plan, no profit sharing was payable with respect to fiscal 2023 unless we achieved actual adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2023 of at least 70% of the amount of budgeted adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2023;\nthe level of difficulty associated with achieving such objectives based on the opportunities and challenges encountered during the year; and\nsignificant transactions or accomplishments for the period not included in the goals for the year.\nOur CEO takes these factors into consideration as well as the relative contributions of each of the named executive officers to the years performance in developing his recommendations for profit sharing amounts. Based on such assessment, our CEO submits recommendations to the Board of Directors for the annual profit sharing amounts to be paid to our named executive officers (other than the CEO), for the Boards review and approval. Similarly, the Chairman assesses the CEOs contribution toward meeting the Companys goals based upon the above factors, and recommends to the Board of Directors a profit sharing allocation for the CEO it believes to be commensurate with such contribution.\nThe Board of Directors retains the ultimate discretion to determine whether the named executive officers will receive annual profit sharing allocations based upon the factors discussed above. The Company is entitled to recover or clawback profit sharing allocations paid to our named executive officers in the event of any accounting restatement arising from a material non-compliance with the financial reporting requirements under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended, in accordance with the Companys Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy dated as of October 19, 2023 (the Clawback Policy). At no time during or after the Companys fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 was the Company required to prepare any accounting restatement that would have entitled the Company to recovery of profit sharing allocations under the Companys Clawback Policy. The Companys Clawback Policy is filed as an Exhibit to this Report.\nManagement Incentive Compensation Plan\nIn fiscal 2007, following our recapitalization, the Board of Directors adopted the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (the Plan) for certain named employees. Under the Plan, employees who participate shall be entitled to receive a pro rata share (as determined in the manner described below) of an amount in cash equal to:\n50% of the distributions (Incentive Distributions) of Available Cash in excess of the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.0675 per unit otherwise distributable to Kestrel Heat pursuant to the Partnership Agreement on account of its general partner units; and\n50% of the cash proceeds (the Gains Interest) which Kestrel Heat shall receive from any sale of its general partner units (as defined in the Partnership Agreement), less expenses and applicable taxes.\nWe believe that the Plan provides a long-term incentive to its participants because it encourages Stars management to increase available cash for distributions in order to trigger the incentive distributions that are only payable if distributions from available cash exceed certain target distribution levels, with higher amounts of incentive distributions triggered by higher levels of distributions. Such increases are not sustainable on a consistent basis without long-term improvements in our operations. In addition, under certain Plan amendments that were adopted in 2012, the participation points of existing plan participants will vest and become irrevocable over a four year period, provided that the participants continue to be employed by us during the vesting period. We believe that this will help ensure that the Plan participants, which include our named executive officers, will have a continuing personal interest in the success of Star.\nThe pro rata share payable to each participant under the Plan is based on the number of participation points as described under Fiscal 2023 Compensation Decisions-Management Incentive Compensation Plan. The amount paid in Incentive Distributions is governed by the Partnership Agreement and Available Cash (as defined in our Partnership Agreement) is distributed to the holders of our common units and general partner units in the following manner:\nFirst, 100% to all common units, pro rata, until there has been distributed to each common unit an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.0675 for that quarter;\nSecond, 100% to all common units, pro rata, until there has been distributed to each common unit an amount equal to any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution for prior quarters;\nThird, 100% to all general partner units, pro rata, until there has been distributed to each general partner unit an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution;\nFourth, 90% to all common units, pro rata, and 10% to all general partner units, pro rata, until each common unit has received the first target distribution of $0.1125; and\nFinally, 80% to all common units, pro rata, and 20% to all general partner units, pro rata.\nAvailable Cash, as defined in our Partnership Agreement, generally means all cash on hand at the end of the relevant fiscal quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by the Board of Directors of our general partner in its reasonable discretion for future cash requirements. These reserves are established for the proper conduct of our business, including acquisitions, the payment of debt principal and interest and for distributions during the next four quarters and to comply with applicable law and the terms of any debt agreements or other agreements to which we are subject. The Board of Directors of our general partner reviews the level of Available Cash each quarter based upon information provided by management.\nTo fund the benefits under the Plan, Kestrel Heat has agreed to permanently and irrevocably forego receipt of the amount of Incentive Distributions that are payable to plan participants. For accounting purposes, amounts payable to management under this Plan will be treated as compensation and will reduce both EBITDA and net income but not adjusted EBITDA. Kestrel Heat has also agreed to contribute to the Company, as a contribution to capital, an amount equal to the Gains Interest payable to participants in the Plan by the Company. The Company is not required to reimburse Kestrel Heat for amounts payable pursuant to the Plan.\nThe Plan is administered by our Chief Financial Officer under the direction of the Board or by such other officer as the Board may from time to time direct. In general, no payments will be made under the Plan if we are not distributing cash under the Incentive Distributions described above.\nEffective as of July 19, 2012, the Board of Directors adopted certain amendments (the Plan Amendments) to the Plan. Under the Plan Amendments, the number and identity of the Plan participants and their participation interests in the Plan have been frozen at the current levels. In addition, under the Plan Amendments, the plan benefits (to the extent vested) may be transferred upon the death of a participant to his or her heirs. A participants vested percentage of his or her plan benefits will be 100% during the time a participant is an employee or consultant of the Company. Following the termination of such positions, a participants vested percentage shall be equal to 20% for each full or partial year of employment or consultation with us starting with the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 (33 1/3% in the case of the Companys chief executive officer at that time).\nWe distributed $1,160,288 in Incentive Distributions under the Plan during fiscal 2023, including payments to the named executive officers of approximately $490,485. With regard to the Gains Interest, Kestrel Heat has not given any indication that it will sell its general partner units within the next 12 months. Thus the Plans value attributable to the Gains Interest currently cannot be determined.\nRetirement and Health Benefits\nWe offer a health and welfare and retirement program to all eligible employees. The named executive officers are generally eligible for the same programs on the same basis as other employees of Star. We maintain a tax-qualified 401(k) retirement plan that provides eligible employees with an opportunity to save for retirement on a tax advantaged basis. Under the 401(k) plan, subject to IRS limitations, each participant can contribute from 0% to 60% of compensation.\nWe make a 4% (or a maximum of 5.5% for participants who had 10 or more years of service at the time our defined benefit plans were frozen and who have reached the age 55) core contribution of a participants compensation and generally can match 2/3 (up to 3.0%) of a participants contributions, subject to IRS limitations.\nIn addition, we have two frozen defined benefit pension plans that were maintained for all eligible employees, including certain executive officers. The present value of accumulated benefits under these frozen defined benefit pension plans for certain executive officers is provided in the table labeled Pension Plans Pursuant to Which Named Executive Officers Have an Accumulated Benefit But Are Not Currently Accruing Benefits.\nFiscal 2023 Compensation Decisions\nFor fiscal 2023, the foregoing elements of compensation were applied as follows:\nBase Salary\nThe following table sets forth each named executive officers base salary as of October 1, 2023 and the percentage increase in base salary over October 1, 2022. The current base salaries for our named executive officers were determined based upon the factors discussed under the caption Base Salary. The average percentage increase in base salary for executives in our peer group was approximately 5.7%.\nName\nSalary\nPercentage Change\nFrom Prior Year\nJeffrey M. Woosnam\n$\n475,000\n3.9\n%\nRichard F. Ambury\n$\n472,055\n3.5\n%\nJeffrey S. Hammond\n$\n354,865\n4.0\n%\nJoseph R. McDonald\n$\n354,865\n4.0\n%\nAnnual Discretionary Profit Sharing Allocation\nBased on the annual performance reviews for our CEO and named executive officers, the Board approved annual profit sharing allocations as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table and notes thereto. For fiscal 2023, the profit sharing amounts reflected in the Summary Compensation Table are 12% lower than fiscal 2022 for Messrs. Woosnam, Ambury, Hammond and McDonald.\nOne of our primary performance measures is Adjusted EBITDA, as defined under the Profit Sharing Plan. For fiscal 2023, Adjusted EBITDA (as calculated under the Profit Sharing Plan) decreased by $14.7 million, or 13.5%, to $94.6 million compared to fiscal 2022. For our peers that are on a fiscal year similar to Star Group, the average percentage increase in Adjusted EBITDA was 5.6%, and the average total compensation decreased by 6%.\nAnother performance measure is acquisitions. During fiscal 2023, the Company acquired two heating oil businesses and one propane business that generate approximately 2.9 million gallons of home heating oil and propane annually. Messrs. Woosnam, Ambury, Hammond and McDonald were instrumental in the successful integration of these transactions.\nManagement Incentive Compensation Plan\nIn 2012, under the Plan Amendments adopted by the Board, the number and identity of the Plan participants and their participation points were frozen at the current levels in order to more closely align the interests of Plan participants and unitholders and to give Plan participants a continuing personal interest in our success. The number of participation points that were previously awarded to the named executive officers was based on the length of service and level of responsibility of the named executive and our desire to retain the named executive.\nIn fiscal 2023, $490,485 was paid to the named executive officers under the Plan as indicated in the following chart:\nName\nPoints\nPercentage\nManagement\nIncentive\nPayments\nJeffrey M. Woosnam\n5.5\n%\n63,288\nRichard F. Ambury\n21.4\n%\n247,880\nJeffrey S. Hammond\n4.5\n%\n52,740\nJoseph R.

Ambury\nWe entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Ambury effective as of April 28, 2008. Mr. Ambury will serve as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer on an at-will basis. The employment agreement provides for one years salary as severance if Mr. Amburys employment is terminated without cause or by Mr. Ambury for good reason.\nAgreement with Jeffrey M. Woosnam\nWe entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Woosnam effective as of June 19, 2019. Mr. Woosnam will serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of Kestrel Heat on an at-will basis. The employment agreement provides for one years salary as severance if Mr. Woosnams employment is terminated without cause or by Mr. Woosnam for good reason.\nChange in Control Agreements\nChange in control arrangements are included in the employment agreement for Mr. Woosnam, Chief Executive Officer and we have entered into a Change in Control Agreement with Mr. Ambury, Chief Financial Officer. Under the terms of each agreement, if either of these executive officers is terminated within 180 days following a change in control (as defined in the agreement), he will be entitled to a payment equal to two times his base annual salary in the year of such termination plus two times the average amount paid as a bonus and/or as profit sharing during the three years preceding the year of such termination. The term change in control means the present equity owners of Kestrel Heat and their affiliates collectively cease to beneficially own equity interests having the voting power to elect at least a majority of the members of the Board of Directors or other governing board of the general partner or any successor entity. If a change in control were to have occurred and their employment was terminated as of the date of this Report, Mr. Woosnam would have received a payment of $2,253,700 and Mr. Ambury would have received a payment of $1,978,380.\nPay Ratio Disclosure\nAs required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the ratio of the annual total compensation, calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K of our CEO, Jeffrey M. Woosnam and the annual total compensation of our median employee. For fiscal 2023, our last completed fiscal year, our CEOs total compensation was $1,142,505, versus our median employee compensation of $73,620. This reflects a CEO pay ratio of 16:1. We identified our median compensation employee by examining total compensation paid for fiscal year 2023 to all individuals, excluding Mr. Woosnam, who were employed by us on September 30, 2023, the last day of our fiscal year based on payroll records. No assumptions, adjustments or estimates were made in respect of total compensation, except that we annualized the compensation of any employee that was not employed with us for all of fiscal year 2023, excluding seasonal and temporary employees.\nIndemnification Agreements\nWe have entered into an indemnification agreement with each of our directors and senior executives. These agreements provide for us to, among other things, indemnify such persons against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers, to advance their expenses incurred as a result of a proceeding as to which they may be indemnified and to cover such person under any directors and officers liability insurance policy we choose, in our discretion, to maintain. These indemnification agreements are intended to provide indemnification rights to the fullest extent permitted under applicable indemnification rights statutes in the State of Delaware and are in addition to any other rights such person may have under our Partnership Agreement and the limited liability company agreement of our general partner, and applicable law. We believe these indemnification agreements enhance our ability to attract and retain knowledgeable and experienced executives and independent, non-management directors.\nBoard of Directors Report\nThe Board of Directors of the general partner of the Company does not have a separate compensation committee. Executive compensation is determined by the Board of Directors.\nThe Board of Directors reviewed and discussed with the Companys management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained in this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on that review and discussion, the Board of Directors recommends that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Companys annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nPaul A.

Mr. Ambury also participated in a tax-qualified supplemental employee retirement plan (the \"SERP\") which, prior to being frozen in 1997, represented contributions to an employee plan to compensate for a reduction in certain benefits prior to 1997. In June 2023, Mr. Ambury received a $64,059 lump sum distribution under the SERP in connection with this withdrawal from the SERP. Mr. Ambury is not entitled to receive any further benefits under the SERP. Included in Mr. Amburys amounts for the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Comp. Earnings are $0, $0 and $333 for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 respectively, for the actuarial changes in the value of his frozen supplemental employee retirement plan. The change in all the named executives pension values (including the supplemental employee retirement plan) are non-cash, and reflect normal adjustments resulting from changes in discount rates and government mandated mortality tables.\n(3)Mr. Woosnam was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer on March 18, 2019.\n(4)Mr. Hammond was appointed Chief Operating Officer on March 18, 2019.\n(5)Mr. McDonald was appointed Chief Customer Officer on March 18, 2019.\n(6)All other compensation is subdivided as follows:\nName\nManagement\nIncentive\nCompensation Plan\nCompany Match and\nCore Contribution to\n401(K) Plan\nCar Allowance or Monetary\nValue for Personal Use of\nCompany Owned Vehicle\nWithdrawal Payment under the Company's tax-qualified SERP\nTotal\nJeffrey M.

Mr. Ambury also participated in a tax-qualified supplemental employee retirement plan which, prior to being frozen in 1997, represented contributions to an employee plan to compensate for a reduction in certain benefits prior to 1997. No other named executives were participants in any of these plans. Each year, the named executive officers accumulated benefits are actuarially calculated generally based on the credited years of service and each employees compensation at the time the plan was frozen. The present value of these amounts are the present value of a single life annuity generally payable at later or normal retirement age, adjusted for changes in discount rates and government mandated mortality tables. See Note 14-Employee Benefit Plans, to Stars Consolidated Financial Statements, for the material assumptions applied in quantifying the present value of the accumulated benefits of these frozen plans.\n(2)In fiscal 2023, Mr. Ambury received a lump-sum distribution in connection with his withdrawal from the SERP. Mr. Ambury is not entitled to any further benefits under the SERP.\nNonqualified Defined Contribution and Other Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans\nNone.\nPotential Payments Upon Termination\nIf Mr. Woosnams employment is terminated for reasons other than for cause or if Mr. Woosnam terminates his employment for good reason, he will be entitled to receive one-years salary as severance, except in the case of a termination following a change in control which is discussed above under Change in Control Agreements. For 12 months following the termination of his employment, Mr. Woosnam is prohibited from competing with the Company or from becoming involved either as an employee, as a consultant or in any other capacity, in the sale of heating oil or propane on a retail basis.\nIf Mr. Amburys employment is terminated for reasons other than cause or if Mr. Ambury terminates his employment for a good reason, he will be entitled to receive a severance payment of one years salary except in the case of a termination following a change in control which is discussed above under Change in Control Agreements. For 12 months following the termination of his employment, Mr. Ambury is prohibited from competing with the Company or from becoming involved either as an employee, as a consultant or in any other capacity, in the sale of heating oil or propane on a retail basis.\nThe amounts shown in the table below assume that the triggering event for each named executive officers termination or change in control payment was effective as of the date of this Report based upon their historical compensation arrangements as of such date. The actual amounts to be paid out can only be determined at the time of such named executive officers termination of employment or Stars change of control.\nThe employment agreements of the foregoing officers also require that they not reveal confidential information of the Company within 12 months following the termination of their employment.\nName\nPotential Payments\nUpon Termination\nPotential Payments\nFollowing\na Change of Control\nJeffrey M.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS\nStar has a written conflict of interest policy and procedure that requires all officers, directors and employees to report to senior corporate management or the board of directors, all personal, financial or family interest in transactions that involve the individual and the Star. In addition, our Governance Guidelines provide that any monetary arrangement between a director and his or her affiliates (including any member of a directors immediate\nfamily) and the Company or any of its affiliates for goods or services shall be subject to approval by the full Board of Directors.\nThe general partner does not receive any management fee or other compensation for its management of Star. The general partner is reimbursed for all expenses incurred on behalf of the Star, including the cost of compensation, that are properly allocable to Star. Our Partnership Agreement provides that the general partner shall determine the expenses that are allocable to Star in any reasonable manner determined by the general partner in its sole discretion. In addition, the general partner and its affiliates may provide services to the Star for which a reasonable fee would be charged as determined by the general partner.\nKestrel has the ability to elect the Board of Directors of Kestrel Heat, including Messrs. Vermylen, Bauer and Lawrence. Messrs. Vermylen, Bauer and Lawrence are also members of the board of managers of Kestrel and, either directly or through affiliated entities, own equity interests in Kestrel. Kestrel owns all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Kestrel Heat.\nPolicies Regarding Transactions with Related Persons\nOur Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Partnership Governance Guidelines and Partnership Agreement set forth policies and procedures with respect to transactions with persons affiliated with the Company and the resolution of conflicts of interest, which taken together provide the Company with a framework for the review and approval of transactions with related persons as such terms are defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K.\nIn connection with the Companys acquisition of assets that currently form part of the Companys Pennsylvania operations, the Company (through one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries) entered into an agreement to lease certain real estate from the seller of such assets in September 1994. The seller of such assets and the original lessor of the real estate was an entity in which Douglas Woosnam, the father of Jeffrey Woosnam, our president and chief executive officer, held a direct, material interest. Since September 1994, the original lease agreement has been amended and extended multiple times. Further, the original lessor assigned the lease to Douglas Woosnam. The last such amendment and extension occurred in January 2019, prior to the time that Jeff Woosnam became an executive officer of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of that amendment, the lease was extended for an additional period commencing September 13, 2021 and ending September 12, 2026. The total rent for the five-year period commencing September 13, 2021 is $1,004,250, payable in 60 monthly payments of $16,737.50 each. The Company has the option to extend the lease for two additional five year periods at an increased minimum rent rate of 2% and 3%, respectively. The lease and all amendments were negotiated at arms length and the rent payable on a per square foot basis is comparable to the per square foot rental rates of similar commercial property in Southampton, Pennsylvania. The Company is responsible for taxes, insurance, utilities and maintenance of the premises. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we paid $200,850 in the aggregate to the lessor under the lease agreement.\nOther than the lease agreement discussed above, for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, Star had no related party transactions or agreements pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K.\nOur Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applies to our directors, officers, employees and their affiliates. It deals with conflicts of interest (e.g., transactions with the Company), confidential information, use of Star assets, business dealings, and other similar topics. The Code requires officers, directors and employees to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest and to report potential conflicts of interest to the Companys Senior Vice President Accounting or Director of Internal Audit.\nOur Partnership Governance Guidelines provide that any monetary arrangement between a director and his or her affiliates (including any member of a directors immediate family) and the Company or any of its affiliates for goods or services shall be subject to approval by the full Board of Directors. Although the Partnership Governance Guidelines by their terms only apply to directors the Board intends to apply this requirement to officers and employees and their affiliates.\nTo the extent that the Board determines that it would be in the best interests of the Company to enter into a transaction with a related person, the Board intends to utilize the procedures set forth in the Partnership Agreement for the review and approval of potential conflicts of interest. Our Partnership Agreement provides that whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the general partner or any of its Affiliates (including its directors, executive officers and controlling members), on the one hand, and the Company or any partner, on the other hand, any resolution or course of action in respect of such conflict of interest shall be permitted and deemed approved by all partners, and shall not constitute a breach of the Partnership Agreement, of any agreement contemplated therein, or of any duty stated or implied by law or equity, if the resolution or course of action is, or by operation of the Partnership Agreement is deemed to be, fair and reasonable to the Company.\nAny conflict of interest and any resolution of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed fair and reasonable to the Company if such conflict of interest or resolution is (i) approved by a committee of independent directors (the Conflicts Committee), (ii) on terms no less favorable to the Company than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or (iii) fair to the Company, taking into account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the Company).\nThe general partner (including the Conflicts Committee) is authorized in connection with its determination of what is fair and reasonable to the Company and in connection with its resolution of any conflict of interest to consider:\n(a)the relative interests of any party to such conflict, agreement, transaction or situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interest;\n(b)any customary or accepted industry practices and any customary or historical dealings with a particular person;\n(c)any applicable generally accepted accounting practices or principles; and\n(d)such additional factors as the general partner (including the Conflicts Committee) determines in its sole discretion to be relevant, reasonable or appropriate under the circumstances.

At its regularly scheduled and special meetings, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors considers and pre-approves any audit and non-audit services to be performed by the Companys independent accountants. The Audit Committee has delegated to its chairman, an independent member of the Companys Board of Directors, the authority to grant pre-approvals of non-audit services provided that the service(s) shall be reported to the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. On June 18, 2003, the Audit Committee adopted its pre-approval policies and procedures. Since that date, there have been no audit or non-audit services rendered by the Companys principal accountants that were not pre-approved.\nPART IV ITEM 15.

We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of self-insurance liabilities\nAs discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company self-insures for a number of risks, including a portion of workers compensation, auto, general liability and medical liability. Self-insurance liabilities are established and periodically evaluated, based upon expectations as to what the ultimate liability may be for outstanding claims using developmental factors based upon historical claim experience, including frequency, severity, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions, with support from a qualified third-party actuary. The balance of the self-insurance liabilities, as of September 30, 2023 amounted to $77.5 million as shown in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. We identified the evaluation of the self-insurance liabilities for workers compensation, auto, and general liability claims as a critical audit matter. Specialized skill and knowledge were necessary to evaluate the actuarial models and key assumptions used to determine the liabilities. Additionally, the evaluation of key assumptions used to estimate the liabilities required complex auditor judgment due to the degree of measurement uncertainty. The key assumptions used include paid and incurred loss development factors, expected loss rates and the selection of the estimated ultimate losses among the estimates derived from the actuarial models. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1) Organization\nStar Group, L.P. (Star the Company, we, us, or our) is a full service provider specializing in the sale of home heating and air conditioning products and services to residential and commercial home heating oil and propane customers. The Company has one reportable segment for accounting purposes. We also sell diesel fuel, gasoline and home heating oil on a delivery only basis. We believe we are the nations largest retail distributor of home heating oil based upon sales volume. Including our propane locations, we serve customers in the more northern and eastern states within the Northeast, Central and Southeast U.S. regions.\nThe Company is organized as follows:\nStar is a limited partnership, which at September 30, 2023, had outstanding 35.6 million Common Units (NYSE: SGU), representing a 99.1% limited partner interest in Star, and 0.3 million general partner units, representing a 0.9% general partner interest in Star. Our general partner is Kestrel Heat, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Kestrel Heat or the general partner). The Board of Directors of Kestrel Heat (the Board) is appointed by its sole member, Kestrel Energy Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Kestrel).\nStar owns 100% of Star Acquisitions, Inc. (SA), a Minnesota corporation, that owns 100% of Petro Holdings, Inc. (Petro). SA and its subsidiaries are subject to Federal and state corporate income taxes. Stars operations are conducted through Petro and its subsidiaries. Petro is primarily a Northeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. region retail distributor of home heating oil and propane that at September 30, 2023 served approximately 402,200 full service residential and commercial home heating oil and propane customers and 52,400 customers on a delivery only basis. We also sell gasoline and diesel fuel to approximately 26,600 customers. We install, maintain, and repair heating and air conditioning equipment and to a lesser extent provide these services outside our heating oil and propane customer base including approximately 20,800 service contracts for natural gas and other heating systems.\nPetroleum Heat and Power Co., Inc. (PH&P) is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Star. PH&P is the borrower and Star is the guarantor of the sixth amended and restated credit agreements $165 million five-year senior secured term loan and the $400 million ($550 million during the heating season of December through April of each year) revolving credit facility, both due July 6, 2027. (See Note 13-Long-Term Debt and Bank Facility Borrowings).\n2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Star Group, L.P. and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany items and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income is comprised of Net income and Other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of the unrealized gain (loss) amortization on the Companys pension plan obligation for its two frozen defined benefit pension plans, unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale investments, unrealized gain (loss) on interest rate hedges and the corresponding tax effects.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRefer to Note 3 - Revenue Recognition for revenue recognition accounting policies. Sales of petroleum products are recognized at the time of delivery to the customer and sales of heating and air conditioning equipment are recognized upon completion of installation. Revenue from repairs, maintenance and other services are recognized upon completion of the service. Payments received from customers for equipment service contracts are deferred and amortized into income over the terms of the respective service contracts, on a straight-line basis, which generally do not exceed one year. To the extent that the Company anticipates that future costs for fulfilling its contractual obligations under its service maintenance contracts will exceed the amount of deferred revenue currently attributable to these contracts, the Company recognizes a loss in current period earnings equal to the amount that anticipated future costs exceed related deferred revenues.\nCost of Product\nCost of product includes the cost of home heating oil, diesel, propane, kerosene, gasoline, throughput costs, barging costs, option costs, and realized gains/losses on closed derivative positions for product sales.\nCost of Installations and Services\nCost of installations and services includes equipment and material costs, wages and benefits for equipment technicians, dispatchers and other support personnel, subcontractor expenses, commissions and vehicle related costs.\nDelivery and Branch Expenses\nDelivery and branch expenses include wages and benefits and department related costs for drivers, dispatchers, garage mechanics, customer service, sales and marketing, compliance, credit and branch accounting, information technology, vehicle and property rental costs, insurance, weather hedge contract costs and recoveries, and operational management and support.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include property costs, wages and benefits (including profit sharing) and department related costs for human resources, finance and corporate accounting, internal audit, administrative support and supply.\nAllocation of Net Income\nNet income for partners capital and statement of operations is allocated to the general partner and the limited partners in accordance with their respective ownership percentages, after giving effect to cash distributions paid to the general partner in excess of its ownership interest, if any.\nNet Income per Limited Partner Unit\nIncome per limited partner unit is computed in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 260-10-05 Earnings Per Share, Master Limited Partnerships (EITF 03-06), by dividing the limited partners interest in net income by the weighted average number of limited partner units outstanding. The pro forma nature of the allocation required by this standard provides that in any accounting period where the Companys aggregate net income exceeds its aggregate distribution for such period, the Company is required to present net income per limited partner unit as if all of the earnings for the periods were distributed, regardless of whether those earnings would actually be distributed during a particular period from an economic or practical perspective. This allocation does not impact the Companys overall net income or other financial results. However, for periods in which the Companys aggregate net income exceeds its aggregate distributions for such period, it will have the impact of reducing the earnings per limited partner unit, as the calculation according to this standard results in a theoretical increased allocation of undistributed earnings to the general partner. In accounting periods where aggregate net income does not exceed aggregate distributions for such period, this standard does not have any impact on the Companys net income per limited partner unit calculation. A separate and independent calculation for each quarter and year-to-date period is performed, in which the Companys contractual participation rights are taken into account.\nCash Equivalents, Receivables, Revolving Credit Facility Borrowings, and Accounts Payable\nThe carrying amount of cash equivalents, receivables, revolving credit facility borrowings, and accounts payable approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. At September 30, 2023, the $45.4 million of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on the consolidated statement of cash flows is comprised of $45.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $0.3 million of restricted cash. At September 30, 2022, the $14.9 million of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on the consolidated statement of cash flows is comprised of $14.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and $0.3 million of restricted cash. Restricted cash represents deposits held by our captive insurance company that are required by state insurance regulations to remain in the captive insurance company as cash.\nReceivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivables from customers are recorded at the invoiced amounts. Finance charges may be applied to trade receivables that are more than 30 days past due, and are recorded as finance charge income.\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is the Companys estimate of the amount of trade receivables that may not be collectible. The allowance is determined at an aggregate level by grouping accounts based on certain account criteria and its receivable aging. The allowance is based on both quantitative and qualitative factors, including historical loss experience, historical collection patterns, overdue status, aging trends, current and future economic conditions. The Company has an established process to periodically review current and past due trade receivable balances to determine the adequacy of the allowance. No single statistic or measurement determines the adequacy of the allowance. The total allowance reflects managements estimate of losses inherent in its trade receivables at the balance sheet date. Different assumptions or changes in economic conditions could result in material changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nInventories\nLiquid product inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value computed on the weighted average cost method. All other inventories, representing parts and equipment are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the FIFO method.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets using the straight-line method. Land improvement useful lives are between ten and twenty years, buildings and leasehold improvements useful lives are between five and thirty years, fleet and other equipment useful lives are between one to fifteen years, tanks and equipment lives are between three to ten years, furniture, fixtures and office equipment useful lives are between five to ten years.\nOperating Lease Right-of-Use Assets and Related Lease Liabilities\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date in an amount equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments over the lease term. Right-of-use (ROU) assets are recognized based on the amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date, minus any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred. Renewal options are included in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability when it is determined that they are reasonably certain of exercise.\nCertain of our lease arrangements contain non-lease components such as common area maintenance. We have elected to account for the lease component and its associated non-lease components as a single lease component for properties and vehicles. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on our balance sheet. The Company has leases that have variable payments, including lease payments where lease payment increases are based on the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index. For such leases, payment at the lease commencement date is used to\nmeasure the ROU assets and operating lease liabilities. Changes in the index and other variable payments are expensed as incurred. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our operating leases is not readily determinable. The basis for an incremental borrowing rate is our Term Loan, market-based yield curves and comparable debt securities.\nCaptive Insurance Collateral\nThe captive insurance collateral is held by our captive insurance company in an irrevocable trust as collateral for certain workers compensation and automobile liability claims. The collateral is required by a third party insurance carrier that insures per claim amounts above a set deductible. If we did not deposit cash into the trust, the third party carrier would require that we issue an equal amount of letters of credit, which would reduce our availability under the sixth amended and restated credit agreement. Due to the expected timing of claim payments, the nature of the collateral agreement with the carrier, and our captive insurance companys source of other operating cash, the collateral is not expected to be used to pay obligations within the next twelve months.\nUnrealized gains and losses, net of related income taxes, are reported as accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss), except for losses from impairments which are determined to be other-than-temporary. Realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in the determination of net income and are included in Interest expense, net, at which time the average cost basis of these securities are adjusted to fair value.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and intangible assets include goodwill, customer lists, trade names and covenants not to compete.\nGoodwill is the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets in the acquisition of a company. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are annually tested for impairment. The Company has one reporting unit and performs a qualitative, and when necessary quantitative, impairment test on its goodwill annually on August 31st or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill might be impaired. We performed qualitative assessments (commonly referred to as Step 0) to evaluate whether it is more-likely-than-not (a likelihood that is more than 50%) that goodwill has been impaired, as a basis to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test. This qualitative assessment includes a review of factors such as our reporting units market value compared to its carrying value, our short-term and long-term unit price performance, our planned overall business strategy compared to recent financial results, as well as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and other relevant Company-specific events. Goodwill impairment if any, needs to be determined if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. If goodwill is determined to be impaired, the amount of impairment is measured based on the excess of the net book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment valuation in each of the periods ending August 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, and it was determined based on each years analysis that there was no goodwill impairment.\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The assessment for impairment requires estimates of future cash flows related to the intangible asset. To the extent the carrying value of the assets exceeds its future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded based on the fair value of the asset.\nWe use amortization methods and determine asset values based on our best estimates using reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections. Key assumptions used to determine the value of these intangibles include projections of future customer attrition or growth rates, product margin increases, operating expenses, our cost of capital, and corporate income tax rates. For significant acquisitions we may engage a third party valuation firm to assist in the valuation of intangible assets of that acquisition. We assess the useful lives of intangible assets based on the estimated period over which we will receive benefit from such intangible assets such as historical evidence regarding customer churn rate. In some cases, the estimated useful lives are based on contractual terms. Customer lists are the names and addresses of an acquired companys customers. Based on historical retention experience, these lists are amortized on a straight-line basis over seven to ten years.\nTrade names are the names of acquired companies. Based on the economic benefit expected and historical retention experience of customers, trade names are amortized on a straight-line basis over three to twenty years.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe use the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions, including fair value estimates, as of the business combination date, and to refine those estimates as necessary during the measurement period (defined as the period, not to exceed one year, in which the amounts recognized for a business combination may be adjusted). Each acquired companys operating results are included in our consolidated financial statements starting on the date of acquisition. The purchase price is equivalent to the fair value of consideration transferred. Tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition are recorded at the acquisition date fair value. The separately identifiable intangible assets generally are comprised of customer lists, trade names and covenants not to compete. Goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nCosts that are incurred to complete the business combination such as legal and other professional fees are not considered part of consideration transferred and are charged to general and administrative expense as they are incurred. For any given acquisition, certain contingent consideration may be identified. Estimates of the fair value of liability or asset classified contingent consideration are included under the acquisition method as part of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed. At each reporting date, these estimates are remeasured to fair value, with changes recognized in earnings.\nAssets Held for Sale\nAssets held for sale at September 30, 2022 represent certain heating oil assets that the Company sold on October 25, 2022. The carrying amount of the assets held for sale included $2.2 million of goodwill and $0.8 million of property and equipment, net. We measure and record assets held for sale at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The carrying amounts of the assets held for sale approximated their fair value at September 30, 2022.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nThe Company reviews intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The Company determines whether the carrying values of such assets are recoverable over their remaining estimated lives through undiscounted future cash flow analysis. If such a review should indicate that the carrying amount of the assets is not recoverable, the Company will reduce the carrying amount of such assets to fair value.\nFinance Charge Income\nFinance charge income represents late customer payment charges and financing income from extended payment plans associated with installations.\nDeferred Charges\nDeferred charges represent the costs associated with the issuance of the term loan and revolving credit facility and are amortized over the life of the facility.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs are expensed as they are incurred. Advertising expenses were $13.5 million, $13.0 million, and $13.5 million, in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively and are recorded in delivery and branch expenses.\nCustomer Credit Balances\nCustomer credit balances represent payments received in advance from customers pursuant to a balanced payment plan (whereby customers pay on a fixed monthly basis) and the payments made have exceeded the charges for liquid product and other services.\nEnvironmental Costs\nCosts associated with managing hazardous substances and pollution are expensed on a current basis. Accruals are made for costs associated with the remediation of environmental pollution when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nSelf-Insurance Liability\nThe Company self-insures a number of risks, including a portion of workers compensation, auto, general liability and medical liability. Self-insurance liabilities are established and periodically evaluated, based upon expectations as to what the ultimate liability may be for outstanding claims using developmental factors based upon historical claim experience, including frequency, severity, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions, with support from a qualified third-party actuary. Liabilities are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nIncome Taxes\nAt a special meeting held October 25, 2017, unitholders voted in favor of proposals to have the Company be treated as a corporation effective November 1, 2017, instead of a partnership, for federal income tax purposes (commonly referred to as a check-the-box election) along with amendments to our Partnership Agreement to effect such changes in income tax classification. For corporate subsidiaries of the Company, a consolidated Federal income tax return is filed.\nThe accompanying financial statements are reported on a fiscal year, however, the Company and its Corporate subsidiaries file Federal and State income tax returns on a calendar year.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence including historical tax losses, it is more likely than not that some or all of deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.\nOur continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense.\nSales, Use and Value Added Taxes\nTaxes are assessed by various governmental authorities on many different types of transactions. Sales reported for product, installations and services exclude taxes.\nDerivatives and Hedging\nDerivative instruments are recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The Company has elected not to designate its commodity derivative instruments as hedging instruments but rather as economic hedges whose changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in our statement of operations in the caption (Increase) decrease in the fair value of derivative instruments. Depending on the risk being economically hedged, realized gains and losses are recorded in cost of product, cost of installations and services, or delivery and branch expenses.\nThe Company has designated its interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedging derivatives. To the extent these derivative instruments are effective and the accounting standards documentation requirements have been met, changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings.\nFair Value Valuation Approach\nThe Company uses valuation approaches that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. The Company determines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements):\nLevel 1 inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date.\nWeather Hedge Contract\nTo partially mitigate the effect of weather on cash flows, the Company has used weather hedge contracts for a number of years. Weather hedge contracts are recorded in accordance with the intrinsic value method defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815-45-15 Derivatives and Hedging, Weather Derivatives (EITF 99-2). The premium paid is included in the caption prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying balance sheets and amortized over the life of the contract, with the intrinsic value method applied at each interim period.\nThe Company entered into weather hedge contracts for fiscal years 2023 and 2022. The hedge period runs from November 1 through March 31, taken as a whole. The Payment Thresholds, or strikes, are set at various levels and are referenced against degree days for the prior ten year average. The maximum that the Company can receive is $12.5 million annually. In addition, we are obligated to make an annual payment capped at $5.0 million if degree days exceed the Payment Threshold. The temperatures experienced during the fiscal 2023 and 2022, were warmer than the strikes in the weather hedge contracts. As a result in fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company reduced delivery and branch expenses for the gains realized under those contracts by $12.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The amounts payable by the counterparties under the weather hedge contracts were received in full in April 2023 and April 2022, respectively.\nFor fiscal 2024, the Company entered into a weather hedge contract with the similar hedge period described above. The maximum that the Company can receive is $12.5 million annually and the Company has no obligation to pay the counterparty beyond the initial premium should degree days exceed the Payment Threshold.\nPension plans\nThe Company has two frozen defined benefit pension plans (the Plan). The Company has no post-retirement benefit plans. The Company estimates the rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to estimate the present value of future benefit obligations in determining its annual pension and other postretirement benefit cost. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience and market conditions.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The Company adopted the ASU effective December 31, 2022. The update extends the sunset of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The guidance provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease potential accounting impacts associated with transitioning away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued, such as interbank offered rates and LIBOR. The Company has $24.0 million of interest rate swap agreements at September 30, 2023 that are benchmarked against LIBOR, which the Company has designated as cash flow hedging derivatives. This guidance includes practical expedients for contract modifications due\nto reference rate reform. The Company has elected to adopt the practical expedient that the Company may change the contractual terms of the interest rate swap agreements that are expected to be affected by reference rate reform and not be required to de-designate the hedging relationships. The Company's adoption of the ASU did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires accounting for contract assets and liabilities from contracts with customers in a business combination to be accounted for in accordance with ASC No. 606. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company does not expect ASU 2021-08 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n3) Revenue Recognition\nThe following disaggregates our revenue by major sources for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nYears Ended September 30,\n(in thousands)\nPetroleum Products:\nHome heating oil and propane\n$\n1,202,194\n$\n1,170,552\n$\n881,526\nMotor fuel and other petroleum products\n448,547\n527,729\n322,793\nTotal petroleum products\n1,650,741\n1,698,281\n1,204,319\nInstallations and Services:\nEquipment installations\n114,756\n121,023\n110,475\nEquipment maintenance service contracts\n126,887\n121,623\n118,546\nBillable call services\n60,478\n65,631\n63,746\nTotal installations and services\n302,121\n308,277\n292,767\nTotal Sales\n$\n1,952,862\n$\n2,006,558\n$\n1,497,086\nPerformance Obligations\nPetroleum product revenues consist of home heating oil and propane as well as diesel fuel and gasoline. Revenues from petroleum products are recognized at the time of delivery to the customer when control is passed from the Company to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring control of the petroleum products. Approximately 94% of our full service residential and commercial home heating oil customers automatically receive deliveries based on prevailing weather conditions. We offer several pricing alternatives to our residential home heating oil customers, including a variable price (market based) option and a price-protected option, the latter of which either sets the maximum price or a fixed price that a customer will pay.\nEquipment maintenance service contracts primarily cover heating, air conditioning, and natural gas equipment. We generally do not sell equipment maintenance service contracts to heating oil customers that do not take delivery of product from us. The service contract period of our equipment maintenance service contracts is generally one year or less. Revenues from equipment maintenance service contracts are recognized into income over the terms of the respective service contracts, on a straight-line basis. Our obligation to perform service is consistent through the duration of the contracts, and the straight-line basis of recognition is a faithful depiction of the transfer of our services. To the extent that the Company anticipates that future costs for fulfilling its contractual obligations under its equipment service contracts will exceed the amount of deferred revenue currently attributable to these contracts, the Company recognizes a loss in current period earnings equal to the amount that anticipated future costs exceed related deferred revenues.\nRevenue from billable call services (repairs, maintenance and other services) and equipment installations (heating, air conditioning, and natural gas equipment) are recognized at the time that the work is performed.\nOur standard payment terms are generally 30 days. Sales reported for product, installations and services exclude taxes assessed by various governmental authorities.\nContract Costs\nWe have elected to recognize incremental costs of obtaining a contract, other than new residential product and equipment maintenance service contracts, as an expense when incurred when the amortization period of the asset that we otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. We recognize an asset for incremental commission expenses paid to sales personnel in conjunction with obtaining new residential customer product and equipment maintenance service contracts. We defer these costs only when we have determined the commissions are, in fact, incremental and would not have been incurred absent the customer contract. Costs to obtain a contract are amortized and recorded ratably as delivery and branch expenses over the period representing the transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate. Costs to obtain new residential product and equipment maintenance service contracts are amortized as expense over the estimated customer relationship period of approximately five years. Deferred contract costs are classified as current or non-current within Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Deferred charges and other assets, net, respectively. At September 30, 2023 the amount of deferred contract costs included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Deferred charges and other assets, net was $3.3 million and $5.4 million, respectively. At September 30, 2022 the amount of deferred contract costs included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Deferred charges and other assets, net was $3.4 million and $5.6 million, respectively. For the years ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 we recognized expense of $3.8 million and $3.9 million, respectively, associated with the amortization of deferred contract costs within delivery and branch expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of a deferred cost exceeds the remaining amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the petroleum products and services related to the cost, less the expected costs related directly to providing those petroleum products and services that have not yet been recognized as expenses. There have been no impairment charges recognized for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.\nAllocation of Transaction Price to Separate Performance Obligations\nOur contracts with customers often include distinct performance obligations to transfer products and perform equipment maintenance services to a customer that are accounted for separately. Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price for each distinct performance obligation for the purpose of allocating the transaction price to separate performance obligations. We determine the stand-alone selling price using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs and typically have more than one stand-alone selling price for petroleum products and equipment maintenance services due to the stratification of those products and services by geography and customer characteristics.\nContract Liability Balances\nThe Company has contract liabilities for advanced payments received from customers for future oil deliveries (primarily amounts received from customers on smart pay budget payment plans in advance of oil deliveries) and obligations to service customers with equipment maintenance service contracts. Approximately 32% of our residential customers take advantage of our smart pay budget payment plan under which their estimated annual oil and propane deliveries and service contract billings are paid for in a series of equal monthly installments. Our smart pay budget payment plans are annual and generally begin outside of the heating season. We generally have received advanced amounts from customers on smart pay budget payment plans prior to the heating season, which are reduced as oil deliveries are made. For customers that are not on smart pay budget payment plans, we generally receive the full contract amount for equipment service contracts with customers at the outset of the contracts. Contract liabilities are recognized straight-line over the service contract period, generally one-year or less. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 the Company had contract liabilities of $170.3 million and $152.1 million, respectively. During the year ended September 30, 2023 the Company recognized $139.9 million of revenue that was included in the September 30, 2022 contract liability balance. During the year ended September 30, 2022 the Company recognized $130.4 million of revenue that was included in the September 30, 2021 contract liability balance.\nReceivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nChanges in the allowance for credit losses are as follows:\n(in thousands)\nCredit Loss Allowance\nBalance at September 30, 2022\n$\n7,755\nCurrent period provision\n9,761\nWrite-offs, net and other\n(9,141\n)\nBalance as of September 30, 2023\n$\n8,375\n4) Quarterly Distribution of Available Cash\nThe Companys Partnership Agreement provides that beginning October 1, 2008, the minimum quarterly distributions on the common units will start accruing at the rate of $0.0675 per quarter ($0.27 on an annual basis). In general, the Company intends to distribute to its partners on a quarterly basis, all of its available cash, if any, in the manner described below. Available cash generally means, for any of its fiscal quarters, all cash on hand at the end of that quarter, less the amount of cash reserves that are necessary or appropriate in the reasonable discretion of the general partners to:\nprovide for the proper conduct of the Companys business including acquisitions and debt payments;\ncomply with applicable law, any of its debt instruments or other agreements; or\nprovide funds for distributions to the common unitholders during the next four quarters, in some circumstances.\nAvailable cash will generally be distributed as follows:\nfirst, 100% to the common units, pro rata, until the Company distributes to each common unit the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.0675;\nsecond, 100% to the common units, pro rata, until the Company distributes to each common unit any arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units for prior quarters;\nthird, 100% to the general partner units, pro rata, until the Company distributes to each general partner unit the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.0675;\nfourth, 90% to the common units, pro rata, and 10% to the general partner units, pro rata (subject to the Management Incentive Plan), until the Company distributes to each common unit the first target distribution of $0.1125; and\nthereafter, 80% to the common units, pro rata, and 20% to the general partner units, pro rata.\nThe Company is obligated to meet certain financial covenants under the sixth amended and restated credit agreement. The Company must maintain excess availability of at least 15% of the revolving commitment then in effect and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 through February 27, 2024 and 1.15 thereafter in order to make any distributions to unitholders. (See Note 13-Long-Term Debt and Bank Facility Borrowings)\nFor fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, cash distributions declared per common unit were $0.630, $0.590, and $0.550, respectively.\nFor fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, $1.2 million, $1.0 million, and $0.9 million, respectively, of incentive distributions were paid to the general partner, exclusive of amounts paid subject to the Management Incentive Plan.\n5) Common Unit Repurchase Plans and Retirement\nIn July 2012, the Board adopted a plan to repurchase certain of the Companys Common Units (the Repurchase Plan). Through May 2023, the Company had repurchased approximately 20.5 million Common Units under the Repurchase Plan. In May 2023, the Board authorized an increase of the number of Common Units that remained available for the Company to repurchase from 1.1 million to a total of 2.6 million, of which, 2.3 million were available for repurchase in open market transactions and 0.3 million were available for repurchase in privately-negotiated transactions. There is no\nguarantee of the number of units that will be purchased under the Repurchase Plan and the Company may discontinue purchases at any time. The Repurchase Plan does not have a time limit. The Board may also approve additional purchases of units from time to time in private transactions. The Companys repurchase activities take into account SEC safe harbor rules and guidance for issuer repurchases. All of the Common Units purchased under the Repurchase Plan will be retired.\nUnder the Credit Agreement dated July 6, 2022, in order to repurchase Common Units we must maintain Availability (as defined in the sixth amended and restated credit agreement) of $60 million, 15% of the facility size of $400 million (assuming no borrowings under the seasonal advance) on a historical pro forma and forward-looking basis, and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.0 through February 27, 2024 and 1.15 thereafter measured as of the date of repurchase or distribution. (See Note 13-Long-Term Debt and Bank Facility Borrowings). The following table shows repurchases under the Repurchase Plan.\n(in thousands, except per unit amounts)\nPeriod\nTotal Number\nof Units\nPurchased\nAverage Price\nPaid per Unit\n(a)\nTotal Number\nof Units\nPurchased as\nPart of\nPublicly\nAnnounced\nPlans or\nPrograms\nMaximum Number\nof Units that May\nYet Be Purchased\nFiscal year 2012 to 2022 total\n24,933\n$\n8.82\n20,045\n1,557\nFirst quarter fiscal year 2023 total\n$\n8.77\n1,146\nSecond quarter fiscal year 2023 total\n$\n11.20\n1,068\nThird quarter fiscal year 2023 total\n-\n$\n-\n-\n2,568\n(b)\nFourth quarter fiscal year 2023 total\n-\n$\n-\n-\n2,568\nFiscal year 2023 total\n$\n9.16\n2,568\nOctober 2023\n$\n11.27\n2,555\nNovember 2023\n-\n$\n-\n-\n2,555\n(c)\n(a)Amounts include repurchase costs.\n(b)In May 2023, the Board authorized an increase in the number of Common Units available for repurchase in open market transactions from 0.8 million to 2.3 million.\n(c)Of the total available for repurchase, approximately 2.3 million are available for repurchase in open market transactions and 0.3 million are available for repurchase in privately-negotiated transactions.\n6) Captive Insurance Collateral\nThe Company considers all of its captive insurance collateral to be Level 1 available-for-sale investments. Investments at September 30, 2023 consist of the following (in thousands):\nAmortized Cost\nGross Unrealized Gain\nGross Unrealized (Loss)\nFair Value\nCash and Receivables\n$\n4,335\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n4,335\nU.S. Government Sponsored Agencies\n50,471\n-\n(1,620\n)\n48,851\nCorporate Debt Securities\n18,210\n(691\n)\n17,531\nTotal\n$\n73,016\n$\n$\n(2,311\n)\n$\n70,717\nInvestments at September 30, 2022 consist of the following (in thousands):\nAmortized Cost\nGross Unrealized Gain\nGross Unrealized (Loss)\nFair Value\nCash and Receivables\n$\n1,838\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n1,838\nU.S. Government Sponsored Agencies\n48,473\n-\n(3,052\n)\n45,421\nCorporate Debt Securities\n20,322\n-\n(919\n)\n19,403\nTotal\n$\n70,633\n$\n-\n$\n(3,971\n)\n$\n66,662\nMaturities of investments were as follows at September 30, 2023 (in thousands):\nNet Carrying Amount\nDue within one year\n$\n46,004\nDue after one year through five years\n24,713\nDue after five years through ten years\n-\nTotal\n$\n70,717\n7) Derivatives and Hedging-Disclosures and Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company uses derivative instruments such as futures, options and swap agreements in order to mitigate exposure to market risk associated with the purchase of home heating oil for price-protected customers, physical inventory on hand, inventory in transit, priced purchase commitments and internal fuel usage. FASB ASC 815-10-05 Derivatives and Hedging, established accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities, along with qualitative disclosures regarding the derivative activity. The Company has elected not to designate its commodity derivative instruments as hedging derivatives, but rather as economic hedges whose change in fair value is recognized in its statement of operations in the line item (Increase) decrease in the fair value of derivative instruments. Depending on the risk being economically hedged, realized gains and losses are recorded in cost of product, cost of installations and services, or delivery and branch expenses.\nAs of September 30, 2023, to hedge a substantial majority of the purchase price associated with heating oil gallons anticipated to be sold to its price-protected customers, the Company held the following derivative instruments that settle in future months to match anticipated sales: 9.3 million gallons of swap contracts with a notional value of $26.1 million and a fair value of $1.9 million, 8.1 million gallons of call options with a notional value of $25.6 million and a fair value of $1.7 million, 4.2 million gallons of put options with a notional value of $9.3 million and a fair value of $0.1 million, and 57.3 million net gallons of synthetic call options with an average notional value of $164.2 million and a fair value of $4.0 million. To hedge the inter-month differentials for its price-protected customers, its physical inventory on hand and inventory in transit, the Company, as of September 30, 2023, had 10.0 million gallons of short future contracts that settle daily with a notional value of $28.2 million and a fair value of $(3.8) million. To hedge its internal fuel usage and other related activities for fiscal 2024, the Company, as of September 30, 2023, had 7.7 million gallons of swap contracts with a notional value of $19.1 million and a fair value of $2.9 million that settle in future months.\nAs of September 30, 2022, to hedge a substantial majority of the purchase price associated with heating oil gallons anticipated to be sold to its price-protected customers, the Company held the following derivative instruments that settle in future months to match anticipated sales: 7.5 million gallons of swap contracts with a notional value of $20.6 million and a fair value of $(0.3) million, 36.3 million gallons of call options with a notional value of $101.4 million and a fair value of $19.2 million, 3.2 million gallons of put options with a notional value of $7.6 million and a fair value of $0.5 million, and 38.6 million net gallons of synthetic call options with an average notional value of $126.7 million and a fair value of $(1.8) million. To hedge the inter-month differentials for its price-protected customers, its physical inventory on hand and inventory in transit, the Company, as of September 30, 2022, had 6.7 million gallons of short future contracts that settle daily with a notional value of $22.1 million and a fair value of $1.0 million and 14.7 gallons of swap contracts that settle daily with a notional value of $55.2 million and a fair value of $2.0 million. To hedge its internal fuel usage and other related activities for fiscal 2023, the Company, as of September 30, 2022, had 5.2 million gallons of swap contracts with a notional value of $15.1 million and a fair value of $(1.1) million that settle in future months.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company has interest rate swap agreements in order to mitigate exposure to market risk associated with variable rate interest on $55.5 million, or 37%, of its long term debt. The Company has designated its interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedging derivatives. To the extent these derivative instruments are effective and the accounting standards documentation requirements have been met, changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings. As of September 30, 2023 the fair value\nof the swap contracts was $1.6 million. As of September 30, 2022, the notional value of the swap contracts was $54.0 million and the fair value of the swap contracts was $2.0 million. We utilized Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy of valuation techniques to determine the fair value of the swap contracts.\nThe Companys derivative instruments are with the following counterparties: Bank of America, N.A., Bank of Montreal, Cargill, Inc., Citibank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Key Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The Company assesses counterparty credit risk and considers it to be low. We maintain master netting arrangements that allow for the non-conditional offsetting of amounts receivable and payable with counterparties to help manage our risks and record derivative positions on a net basis. The Company generally does not receive cash collateral from its counterparties and does not restrict the use of cash collateral it maintains at counterparties. At September 30, 2023, the aggregate cash posted as collateral in the normal course of business at counterparties was $5.6 million. Positions with counterparties who are also parties to our credit agreement are collateralized under that facility. As of September 30, 2023, $0.1 million hedge positions or payable amounts were secured under the credit facility.\nThe Companys Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities represent the fair value of commodity contracts used in its hedging activities that are identical and traded in active markets. The Companys Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities represent the fair value of commodity and interest rate contracts used in its hedging activities that are valued using either directly or indirectly observable inputs, whose nature, risk and class are similar. No significant transfers of assets or liabilities have been made into and out of the Level 1 or Level 2 tiers. All derivative instruments were non-trading positions and were either a Level 1 or Level 2 instrument. The Company had no Level 3 derivative instruments. The fair market value of our Level 1 and Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities are calculated by our counter-parties and are independently validated by the Company. The Companys calculations are, for Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities, based on the published New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) market prices for the commodity contracts open at the end of the period. For Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities the calculations performed by the Company are based on a combination of the NYMEX published market prices and other inputs, including such factors as present value, volatility and duration.\nThe Company had no assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to their initial recognition.

However, the bank group is not obligated to fund the $200 million increase. If the bank group elects not to fund the increase, the Company can add additional lenders to the group, with the consent of the Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by the Company and its subsidiaries and are secured by liens on substantially all of the Companys assets including accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles, real property, fixtures and equipment.\nAll amounts outstanding under the credit agreement become due and payable on the facility termination date of July 6, 2027. The Term Loan is repayable in quarterly payments of $4.1 million, plus an annual payment equal to 25% of the annual Excess Cash Flow as defined in the credit agreement (an amount not to exceed $8.5 million annually), less certain voluntary prepayments made during the year, with final payment at maturity. As of September 30, 2023, the Company expects to make approximately $4.0 million of additional term loan repayments due to Excess Cash Flow for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The amount is included in the caption current maturities of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. In fiscal 2022, the Company did not have to make an Excess Cash Flow payment.\nThe interest rate on the revolving credit facility and the term loan is based on a margin over Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") or a base rate. At September 30, 2023, the effective interest rate on the term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings was approximately 6.6% and 6.3%, respectively. At September 30, 2022, the effective interest rate on the term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings was approximately 4.7% and 2.6%, respectively.\nThe Commitment Fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility is 0.30% from December through April, and 0.20% from May through November.\nThe credit agreement requires the Company to meet certain financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of not less than 1.1 as long as the Term Loan is outstanding or revolving credit facility availability is less than 12.5% of the facility size. In addition, as long as the Term Loan is outstanding, a senior secured leverage ratio cannot be more than 3.0 as calculated as of the quarters ending June or September, and no more than 5.5 as calculated as of the quarters ending December or March.\nOn September 26, 2023, the Company signed a first amendment (the Amendment) to its Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a group of banks, which provides temporary relief from certain financial covenants under the Credit Agreement that must be satisfied in order for the Company to make distributions and unit repurchases or, if\navailability under the Credit Agreement drops below a minimum threshold due to, among other things, the Company making acquisitions. In particular, the Amendment reduces the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio for distributions and unit repurchases during the period commencing October 31, 2023 and ending February 27, 2024 (the Relief Period) from 1.15-to-1.00 down to 1.00-to-1.00. The Amendment also reduces the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio that must be maintained by the Company if availability under the under the Credit Agreement drops below 12.5% of the facility size during the Relief Period from 1.10-to-1.00 down to 1.00-to-1.00.\nCertain restrictions are also imposed by the credit agreement, including restrictions on the Companys ability to incur additional indebtedness, to pay distributions to unitholders, to pay certain inter-company dividends or distributions, make investments, grant liens, sell assets, make acquisitions and engage in certain other activities.\nAt September 30, 2023, $148.5 million of the term loan was outstanding, $0.2 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, $0.1 million hedge positions were secured under the credit agreement and $3.2 million of letters of credit were issued and outstanding. At September 30, 2022, $165.0 million of the term loan was outstanding, $20.3 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, we did not have to provide collateral for our hedge positions under the credit agreement and $5.1 million of letters of credit were issued and outstanding.\nAt September 30, 2023, availability was $202.1 million, the Company was in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio and the senior secured leverage ratio, and the restricted net assets totaled approximately $253.7 million. Restricted net assets are assets in the Companys subsidiaries, the distribution or transfer of which to Star Group, L.P. are subject to limitations under its credit agreement. At September 30, 2022, availability was $189.4 million, the Company was in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio and the senior secured leverage ratio, and the restricted net assets totaled approximately $248.0 million.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the maturities (including working capital borrowings and expected repayments due to Excess Cash Flow) during fiscal years ending September 30, considering the terms of our credit agreement, are set forth in the following table (in thousands):\n$\n20,740\n$\n16,500\n$\n16,500\n$\n95,000\nThereafter\n$\n-\n14) Employee Benefit Plans\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe Company has 401(k) and other defined contribution plans that cover eligible non-union and union employees, and makes employer contributions to these plans, subject to IRS limitations. The Companys 401(k) plan provides for each participant to contribute from 0% to 60% of compensation, subject to IRS limitations. The Companys aggregate contributions to the 401(k) plans during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, were $8.5 million, $8.5 million, and $8.2 million, respectively. The Companys aggregate contribution to the other defined contribution plans for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, were $0.5 million, $0.5 million, and $0.6 million respectively.\nManagement Incentive Compensation Plan\nThe Company has a Management Incentive Compensation Plan (the Plan). The long-term compensation structure is intended to align the employees performance with the long-term performance of our unitholders. Under the Plan, certain named employees who participate shall be entitled to receive a pro rata share of an amount in cash equal to:\n50% of the distributions (Incentive Distributions) of Available Cash in excess of the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.0675 per unit otherwise distributable to Kestrel Heat pursuant to the Company Agreement on account of its general partner units; and\n50% of the cash proceeds (the Gains Interest) which Kestrel Heat shall receive from the sale of its general partner units (as defined in the Partnership Agreement), less expenses and applicable taxes.\nThe pro rata share payable to each participant under the Plan is based on the number of participation points as described under Fiscal 2023 Compensation Decisions-Management Incentive Compensation Plan. The amount paid in Incentive Distributions is governed by the Partnership Agreement and the calculation of Available Cash.\nTo fund the benefits under the Plan, Kestrel Heat has agreed to forego receipt of the amount of Incentive Distributions that are payable to plan participants. For accounting purposes, amounts payable to management under this Plan will be treated as compensation and will reduce net income. Kestrel Heat has also agreed to contribute to the Company, as a contribution to capital, an amount equal to the Gains Interest payable to participants in the Plan by the Company. The Company is not required to reimburse Kestrel Heat for amounts payable pursuant to the Plan.\nThe Plan is administered by the Companys Chief Financial Officer under the direction of the Board or by such other officer as the Board may from time to time direct. In general, no payments will be made under the Plan if the Company is not distributing cash under the Incentive Distributions described above.\nIn fiscal 2012, the Board of Directors adopted certain amendments (the Plan Amendments) to the Plan. Under the Plan Amendments, the number and identity of the Plan participants and their participation interests in the Plan have been frozen at the current levels. In addition, under the Plan Amendments, the plan benefits (to the extent vested) may be transferred upon the death of a participant to his or her heirs. A participants vested percentage of his or her plan benefits will be 100% during the time a participant is an employee or consultant of the Company. Following the termination of such positions, a participants vested percentage is equal to 20% for each full or partial year of employment or consultation with the Company starting with the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 (33 1/3% in the case of the Companys chief executive officer at that time).\nThe Company distributed to management and the general partner Incentive Distributions of approximately $2,321,000 during fiscal 2023, $2,055,000 during fiscal 2022, and $1,833,000 during fiscal 2021. Included in these amounts for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, were distributions under the management incentive compensation plan of $1,160,000, $1,028,000, and $917,000, respectively, of which named executive officers received approximately $490,485 during fiscal 2023, $434,431 during fiscal 2022, and $386,857 during fiscal 2021. With regard to the Gains Interest, Kestrel Heat has not given any indication that it will sell its general partner units within the next twelve months. Thus the Plans value attributable to the Gains Interest currently cannot be determined.\nMultiemployer Pension Plans\nAt September 30, 2023, approximately 44% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 9% of our employees are in collective bargaining agreements that are up for renewal within the next fiscal year. We contribute to various multiemployer union administered pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that provide for such plans for covered union-represented employees. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in that assets contributed are pooled and may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the remaining participating employers may be required to bear the unfunded obligations of the plan. If we choose to stop participating in a multiemployer plan, we may be required to pay a withdrawal liability in part based on the underfunded status of the plan.\nThe following table outlines our participation and contributions to multiemployer pension plans for the periods ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021. The EIN/Pension Plan Number column provides the Employer Identification Number (EIN) and the three-digit plan number. The most recent Pension Protection Act Zone Status for 2023 and 2022 relates to the plans two most recent fiscal year-ends, based on information received from the plans as reported on their Form 5500 Schedule MB. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65 percent funded and are designated as critical or critical and declining, plans in the yellow zone are less than 80 percent funded and are designated as endangered, and plans in the green zone are at least 80 percent funded. As of September 30, 2023 the New England Teamsters and Trucking Industry Pension Fund (the NETTI Fund), IAM National Pension, Teamsters Local 469 Pension and Local 445 Pension funds have been classified as carrying red zone status, meaning that the value of funds assets are less than 65% of the actuarial value of the funds benefit obligations or have made a voluntary election. The FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (FIP) or a rehabilitation plan (RP) is either pending or has been implemented. Certain plans have been aggregated in the All Other Multiemployer Pension Plans line of the following table, as our participation in each of these individual plans is not significant.\nFor the Westchester Teamsters Pension Fund, Local 553 Pension Fund and Local 463 Pension Fund, we provided more than 5 percent of the total plan contributions from all employers for 2023, 2022 and 2021, as disclosed in the respective plans Form 5500. The collective bargaining agreements of these plans require contributions based on the hours worked and there are no minimum contributions required.\nPension Protection\nAct Zone\nStatus\nFIP / RP Status\nCompany\nContributions\n(in thousands)\nPension Fund\nEIN\n/ Pension Plan\nNumber\nPending / Implemented\nSurcharge\nImposed\nExpiration Date\nof Collective-\nBargaining\nAgreements\nNew England Teamsters and Trucking Industry Pension Fund\n04-6372430/ 001\nRed\nRed\nYes / Implemented\n2,721\n2,605\n2,563\nNo\n4/30/24 to 4/30/28\nWestchester Teamsters Pension Fund\n13-6123973/ 001\nGreen\nGreen\nN/A\n1,153\n1,100\nNo\n1/31/24 to 12/31/24\nLocal 553 Pension Fund\n13-6637826/ 001\nGreen\nGreen\nN/A\n2,516\n2,741\n2,841\nNo\n12/15/25 to 1/15/26\nLocal 463 Pension Fund\n11-1800729/ 001\nGreen\nGreen\nN/A\nNo\n6/30/25 to 2/28/26\nIAM National Pension Fund\n51-6031295/ 002\nRed\nRed\nYes / Implemented\n2,477\n2,585\n2,532\nYes\n10/31/23 to 6/30/26\nTeamsters Local 469 Pension Plan\n22-6172237 / 001\nRed\nRed\nYes / Implemented\nYes\n8/31/2024\nLocal 445 Pension Fund\n13-1864489/ 001\nRed\nRed\nYes / Implemented\nYes\n10/31/2024\nAll Other Multiemployer Pension Plans\nTotal Contributions\n$\n9,311\n$\n9,637\n$\n9,603\nAgreement with the New England Teamsters and Trucking Industry Pension Fund\nIn fiscal 2015, the Teamsters ratified an agreement among certain subsidiaries of the Company and the NETTI Fund, a multiemployer pension plan in which such subsidiaries participate, providing for the Companys participating subsidiaries to withdraw from the NETTI Funds original employer pool and enter the NETTI Funds new employer pool. The NETTI Fund includes over two hundred of our current employees. The withdrawal from the original employer pool triggered an undiscounted withdrawal obligation of $48.0 million that is to be paid in equal monthly installments over 30 years, or $1.6 million per year.\nOur status in the newly-established pool of the NETTI Fund is accounted for as participation in a new multiemployer pension plan, and therefore we recognize expense based on the contractually-required contribution for each period, and we recognize a liability for any contributions due and unpaid at the end of a reporting period.\nAs of September 30, 2023 we had $0.3 million and $16.0 million balances included in the captions accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet representing the remaining balance of the NETTI Fund withdrawal liability. As of September 30, 2022 we had $0.3 million and $16.2 million balances included in the captions accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively. Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for long-term financing of a similar maturity, the fair value of the NETTI Fund withdrawal liability as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 were $18.5 million and $20.2 million, respectively. We utilized Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy of valuation techniques to determine the fair value of this liability.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nThe Company has two frozen defined benefit pension plans (the Plan). The Company has no post-retirement benefit plans.\nThe following table provides the net periodic benefit cost for the period, a reconciliation of the changes in the Plan assets, projected benefit obligations, and the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated other comprehensive income at the dates indicated using a measurement date of September 30 (in thousands).

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the actuarial gain was primarily due to the increase in the weighted average discount rate relating to the two frozen defined benefit plans from 2.65% as of September 30, 2021 to 5.50% as of September 30, 2022.\nThe $10.5 million net actuarial loss balance at September 30, 2023 for the two frozen defined benefit pension plans in accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized and amortized into net periodic pension costs as an actuarial loss in future years.\nSeptember 30,\nWeighted-Average Assumptions Used in the Measurement of the Companys Benefit Obligation\nDiscount rate at year end date\n5.85%\n5.50%\n2.65%\nExpected return on plan assets for the year ended\n4.56%\n3.77%\n3.66%\nRate of compensation increase\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nThe expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value of plan assets determined using fair value.\nThe Companys expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is updated at least annually, taking into consideration our asset allocation, historical returns on the types of assets held, and the current economic environment. For fiscal year 2024, the Companys assumption for return on plan assets will be 5.2% per annum.\nThe discount rate used to determine net periodic pension expense for fiscal year 2023, 2022, and 2021 was 5.85%, 5.50%, and 2.65%, respectively. The discount rate used by the Company in determining pension expense and pension obligations reflects the yield of high quality (AA or better rating by a recognized rating agency) corporate bonds whose cash flows are expected to match the timing and amounts of projected future benefit payments.\nThe Plans objectives are to have the ability to pay benefit and expense obligations when due, to maintain the funded ratio of the Plan, to maximize return within reasonable and prudent levels of risk in order to minimize contributions and charges to the profit and loss statement, and to control costs of administering the Plan and managing the investments of the Plan. The target asset allocation of the Plan (currently 90% domestic fixed income, 7% domestic equities and 2% international equities and 1% cash and cash equivalents) is based on a long-term perspective, and as the Plan gets closer to being fully funded, the allocations have been adjusted to lower volatility from equity holdings.\nThe Company had no Level 2 or Level 3 pension plan assets during the two years ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022. The fair values and percentage of the Companys pension plan assets by asset category are as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30,\nConcentration\nConcentration\nAsset Category\nLevel 1\nPercentage\nLevel 1\nPercentage\nCorporate and U.S. government bond fund (1)\n$\n39,852\n90%\n$\n42,921\n90%\nU.S. large-cap equity (1)\n3,244\n7%\n3,411\n7%\nInternational equity (1)\n2%\n2%\nCash\n1%\n1%\nTotal\n$\n44,206\n100%\n$\n47,454\n100%\n(1)Represent investments in Vanguard funds that seek to replicate the asset category description.\nThe Company is not obligated to make a minimum required contribution in fiscal year 2023, and currently does not expect to make an optional pension contribution.\nExpected benefit payments over each of the next five years will total approximately $3.8 million per year. Expected benefit payments for the five years thereafter will aggregate approximately $16.6 million.\n15) Income Taxes\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act allows employers to defer the payment of the employer's portion of Social Security taxes for period beginning March 27, 2020 and ending December 31, 2020 to years 2021 and 2022. The company elected to defer the payment of its portion of Social Security taxes through September 30, 2022 of $5.2 million and recorded a related deferred tax asset of $1.5 million at September 30, 2022. No amount is deferred as of September 30, 2023.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Reform Act) was enacted into law. The Tax Reform Act allows for the full depreciation, in the year acquired, for certain fixed assets purchased between September 28, 2017 and December 31, 2022 (also known as 100% bonus depreciation).\nIncome tax expense is comprised of the following for the indicated periods (in thousands):\nYears Ended September 30,\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$\n9,902\n$\n11,900\n$\n16,077\nState\n4,583\n5,019\n6,237\nDeferred\nFederal\n(843\n)\n(2,563\n)\n8,263\nState\n(618\n)\n3,098\n$\n13,984\n$\n13,738\n$\n33,675\nThe provision for income taxes differs from income taxes computed at the Federal statutory rate as a result of the following (in thousands):\nYears Ended September 30,\nIncome from continuing operations before taxes\n$\n45,929\n$\n49,026\n$\n121,412\nProvision for income taxes:\nTax at Federal statutory rate\n$\n9,645\n$\n10,295\n$\n25,496\nState taxes net of federal benefit\n3,401\n3,251\n7,927\nPermanent differences\nChange in valuation allowance\nOther\n(265\n)\n(30\n)\n$\n13,984\n$\n13,738\n$\n33,675\nThe components of the net deferred taxes for the years ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 using current tax rates are as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30,\nDeferred tax assets:\nOperating lease liabilities\n$\n27,473\n$\n28,591\nNet operating loss carryforwards\n5,178\n5,432\nVacation accrual\n2,775\n3,050\nPension accrual\n3,696\n3,666\nAllowance for bad debts\n2,285\n2,155\nInsurance accrual\n1,870\n1,934\nInventory capitalization\n(580\n)\nOther, net\n1,319\nTotal deferred tax assets\n44,430\n45,567\nValuation allowance\n(4,437\n)\n(4,184\n)\nNet deferred tax assets\n$\n39,993\n$\n41,383\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n$\n26,025\n$\n27,097\nProperty and equipment\n14,937\n15,012\nIntangibles\n19,897\n19,936\nFair value of derivative instruments\n1,270\n1,851\nOther, net\n3,635\n3,107\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n$\n65,764\n$\n67,003\nNet deferred taxes\n$\n(25,771\n)\n$\n(25,620\n)\nIn order to fully realize the net deferred tax assets, the Companys corporate subsidiaries will need to generate future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence including historical tax losses, it is more likely than not that some or all of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 was $0.3 million. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 was $0.2 million. Based upon a review of a number of factors and all available evidence, including recent historical operating performance, the expectation of sustainable earnings, and the confidence that sufficient positive taxable income will continue in all tax jurisdictions for the foreseeable future, management concludes, it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the full benefit of its deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowance related to State net operating loss carryforwards at September 30, 2023.\nAs of January 1, 2023, the Company had State tax effected net operating loss carry forwards (NOLs) of approximately $0.8 million after consideration of valuation allowances. The State NOLs, which will expire between 2023 and 2037, are generally available to offset any future taxable income in certain states\nAt September 30, 2023, we did not have unrecognized income tax benefits.\nWe file U.S. Federal income tax returns and various state and local returns. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. For our Federal income tax returns we have four tax years subject to examination. In our major state tax jurisdictions of New York, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania we have four years that are subject to examination. In the state tax jurisdiction of New Jersey we have five tax years that are subject to examination. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretation of tax law, we believe that our provision for income taxes reflect the most probable outcome. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events.\n16) Leases\nThe Company has entered into certain operating leases for office space, vehicles and other equipment with lease terms between one to fifteen years, expiring between 2023 and 2033. Some of the Companys real estate property lease agreements have options to extend the leases for up to ten years.\nA summary of total lease costs and other information is comprised of the following for the indicated periods:\nYears Ended September 30,\n(in thousands)\nLease cost:\nOperating lease cost\n$\n23,637\n$\n23,186\n$\n25,185\nShort-term lease cost\n1,024\nVariable lease cost\n5,598\n7,400\n5,867\nTotal lease cost\n$\n30,053\n$\n31,610\n$\n31,878\nOther information:\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows from operating leases\n$\n23,622\n$\n22,513\n$\n24,894\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities\n$\n15,994\n$\n16,366\n$\n15,894\nWeighted-average remaining lease term - operating leases\n5.6 years\n6.1 years\n6.6 years\nWeighted-average discount rate - operating leases\n5.9\n%\n5.4\n%\n4.8\n%\nMaturities of noncancelable operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2023 are as follows:\nSeptember 30,\n(in thousands)\n$\n23,271\n22,346\n19,694\n15,539\n11,512\nThereafter\n20,808\nTotal undiscounted lease payments\n113,170\nLess imputed interest\n(17,485\n)\nTotal lease liabilities\n$\n95,685\n17) Supplemental Disclosure of Cash Flow Information\nYears Ended September 30,\n(in thousands)\nCash paid during the period for:\nIncome taxes, net\n$\n15,130\n$\n17,122\n$\n21,936\nInterest\n$\n17,805\n$\n10,077\n$\n8,928\n18) Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Companys operations are subject to the operating hazards and risks normally incidental to handling, storing and transporting and otherwise providing for use by consumers hazardous liquids such as home heating oil and propane. In the ordinary course of business, the Company is a defendant in various legal proceedings and litigation. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. We do not believe these matters, when considered individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nThe Company maintains insurance policies with insurers in amounts and with coverages and deductibles we believe are reasonable and prudent. However, the Company cannot assure that this insurance will be adequate to protect it from all material expenses related to current and potential future claims, legal proceedings and litigation, as certain types of claims may be excluded from our insurance coverage. If we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits, or if we incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n19) Earnings per Limited Partner Units\nThe following table presents the net income allocation and per unit data:\nBasic and Diluted Earnings Per Limited Partner:\nYears Ended September 30,\n(in thousands, except per unit data)\nNet income\n$\n31,945\n$\n35,288\n$\n87,737\nLess General Partners interest in net income\nNet income available to limited partners\n31,657\n35,007\n87,048\nLess dilutive impact of theoretical distribution of\nearnings *\n2,600\n3,230\n13,163\nLimited Partners interest in net income\n$\n29,057\n$\n31,777\n$\n73,885\nPer unit data:\nBasic and diluted net income available to limited partners\n$\n0.89\n$\n0.94\n$\n2.15\nLess dilutive impact of theoretical distribution of\nearnings *\n0.08\n0.09\n0.33\nLimited Partners interest in net income under\n$\n0.81\n$\n0.85\n$\n1.82\nWeighted average number of Limited Partner units outstanding\n35,694\n37,384\n40,553\n* In any accounting period where the Companys aggregate net income exceeds its aggregate distribution for such period, the Company is required to present net income per limited partner unit as if all of the earnings for the period were distributed, based on the terms of the Partnership agreement, regardless of whether those earnings would actually be distributed during a particular period from an economic or practical perspective. This allocation does not impact the Companys overall net income or other financial results.\n20) Selected Quarterly Financial Data (unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nDec. 31,\nMar. 31,\nJun. 30,\nSep. 30,\n(in thousands - except per unit data)\nTotal\nSales\n$\n648,187\n$\n737,617\n$\n300,121\n$\n266,937\n$\n1,952,862\nGross profit for product, installation and service\n152,551\n203,039\n64,428\n50,733\n470,751\nOperating income (loss)\n23,605\n91,515\n(29,586\n)\n(22,989\n)\n62,545\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n19,002\n86,294\n(33,196\n)\n(26,171\n)\n45,929\nNet income (loss)\n13,539\n62,041\n(23,906\n)\n(19,729\n)\n31,945\nLimited Partner interest in net income (loss)\n13,417\n61,479\n(23,690\n)\n(19,549\n)\n31,657\nNet income (loss) per Limited Partner unit:\nBasic and diluted (a)\n$\n0.33\n$\n1.42\n$\n(0.67\n)\n$\n(0.55\n)\n$\n0.81\nThree Months Ended\nDec. 31,\nMar. 31,\nJun. 30,\nSep. 30,\n(in thousands - except per unit data)\nTotal\nSales\n$\n488,270\n$\n782,543\n$\n439,101\n$\n296,644\n$\n2,006,558\nGross profit for product, installation and service\n139,628\n220,073\n77,305\n47,224\n484,230\nOperating income (loss)\n22,624\n117,245\n(11,496\n)\n(67,920\n)\n60,453\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n20,327\n114,279\n(14,353\n)\n(71,227\n)\n49,026\nNet income (loss)\n14,489\n81,379\n(10,587\n)\n(49,993\n)\n35,288\nLimited Partner interest in net income (loss)\n14,367\n80,682\n(10,494\n)\n(49,548\n)\n35,007\nNet income (loss) per Limited Partner unit:\nBasic and diluted (a)\n$\n0.32\n$\n1.75\n$\n(0.29\n)\n$\n(1.36\n)\n$\n0.85\n(a)The sum of the quarters do not add-up to the total due to the weighting of Limited Partner Units outstanding, rounding or the theoretical effects of FASB ASC 260-10-45-60 to Master Limited Partners earnings per unit.\n21) Subsequent Events\nQuarterly Distribution Declared\nIn October 2023, we declared a quarterly distribution of $0.1625 per unit, or $0.65 per unit on an annualized basis, on all Common Units with respect to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, paid on October 30, 2023, to holders of record on October 20, 2023. The amount of distributions in excess of the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.0675, were distributed in accordance with our Partnership Agreement, subject to management incentive compensation plan. As a result, $5.8 million was paid to the Common Unit holders, $0.3 million to the General Partner unit holders (including $0.3 million of incentive distribution as provided in our Partnership Agreement) and $0.3 million to management pursuant to the management incentive compensation plan which provides for certain members of management to receive incentive distributions that would otherwise be payable to the General Partner.\nAcquisitions\nSubsequent to September 30, 2023, the Company purchased the customer list and assets of two heating oil businesses for an aggregate amount of approximately $2.5 million.\nSchedule I\nSTAR GROUP, L.P.
