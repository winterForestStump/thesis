Additional disclosures regarding our spin-off of the Diabetes Care business are provided in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nInternational Operations\nBDs products are manufactured and sold worldwide. For reporting purposes, we organize our operations outside the United States as follows: EMEA (which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa); Greater Asia (which includes countries in Greater China, Japan, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Korea, and Australia and New Zealand); Latin America (which includes Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America); and Canada. BD has manufacturing operations outside the United States in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, China, Dominican Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Geographic information with respect to BDs operations is included under the heading Geographic Information in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nForeign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability related to foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues. BD believes its activities in some countries outside the United States involve greater risk than its domestic business due to the factors cited herein. See further discussion of these risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in BD involves a variety of risks and uncertainties. The following describes some of the material risks that could adversely affect BDs business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. We may also be adversely impacted by other risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial.\nBusiness, Economic and Industry Risks\nGlobal economic conditions, including inflation and supply chain disruptions, could continue to adversely affect our operations.\nGeneral global economic downturns and macroeconomic trends, including heightened inflation, capital market volatility, interest rate and currency rate fluctuations, and economic slowdown or recession, may result in unfavorable conditions that could negatively affect demand for our products and services, or the prices we can charge for our products, disrupt our supply chain, impair our ability to produce our products, increase borrowing costs and exacerbate some of the other risks that affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, general economic conditions may impact the healthcare industry, including\nreductions in capital spending, changes in the delivery of healthcare services and increasing labor disputes, which could in turn affect demand for our products and services. Both domestic and international markets experienced inflationary pressures in fiscal year 2023 and we expect inflation to persist in the future but at lower levels than in fiscal year 2023. In addition, the Federal Reserve in the U.S. and other central banks in various countries have raised, and may again raise, interest rates in response to concerns about inflation, which, coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets, may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks. Interest rate increases or other government actions taken to reduce inflation could also result in recessionary pressures in many parts of the world. Furthermore, currency exchange rates have been especially volatile in the recent past, and these currency fluctuations have affected, and may continue to affect, the reported value of our assets and liabilities, as well as our cash flows. In addition, we have previously experienced delays in collecting government receivables in certain countries due to economic conditions, and we may experience similar delays in the future in these and other countries or regions experiencing financial problems.\nWe have also experienced, and may continue to experience, significant challenges in our global supply chain, including shortages in supply, or disruptions or delays in shipments, of certain materials or components used in our products, and related price increases. While to date, we have been able to manage the challenges associated with these delays and shortages without significant disruption to our business, no assurance can be given that these efforts will continue to be successful.\nOur international operations subject us to certain business risks.\nA substantial amount of our sales come from our operations outside the U.S., and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets, especially in emerging markets. Our foreign operations subject us to certain commercial, political and financial risks. In addition to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange (discussed above), our business in these foreign markets is subject to changing political, social, and geopolitical conditions, such as the evolving situations in Ukraine, the Middle East and Asia, including any political instability resulting from war, terrorism, insurrections and civil unrest, and changing economic conditions in these markets, such as inflation, deflation, interest rate volatility and credit availability. Additionally, a number of factors, including U.S. relations with the governments of the foreign countries in which we operate, changes to international trade agreements and treaties, changes in tax laws and regulations, economic sanctions, export controls, restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders, tariffs and other increases in trade protectionism and barriers to market participation, or the weakening or loss of certain intellectual property protection rights in some countries, may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Foreign regulatory requirements, including those related to the testing, authorization, and labeling of products and import or export licensing requirements, could affect the availability of our products in these markets. In addition to these broader market conditions, our operations may also be impacted by a variety of local factors, such as competition from local companies, local product preferences and requirements, and changes in local healthcare payment systems and healthcare delivery systems. We also experience longer payment terms for account receivables in foreign jurisdictions than we experience in the U.S., and we face increased difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing our foreign operations.\nThe success of our operations outside the U.S. also depends, in part, on our ability to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to, among other things, our production facilities and sales and distribution networks. These and other factors may adversely impact our ability to pursue our growth strategy in these markets.\nIn addition, our international operations are governed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws. Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased substantially in recent years, with more enforcement proceedings by U.S. and foreign governmental agencies and the imposition of significant fines and penalties. While we have implemented policies and procedures relating to compliance with these laws, our international operations, which often involve customer relationships with foreign governments, create the risk that there may be unauthorized payments or offers of payments made by employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors. We are also subject to certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that restrict BD from transacting business with, or making investments in, certain countries, governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S. or foreign economic sanctions or export restrictions. Any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government investigations and significant criminal\nor civil sanctions and other liabilities, and negatively affect our reputation and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe medical technology industry is very competitive.\nWe are a global company that faces significant competition from a wide range of existing competitors and new market entrants. These include large medical device companies with multiple product lines, some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do, as well as firms which are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets or product lines. Non-traditional entrants, such as technology companies, are also entering into the healthcare industry and some may have greater financial and other resources than we do. We face competition across all our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold on the basis of product features, clinical or economic outcomes, product quality, availability, price, services and other factors. Our ability to compete is also impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements, including increased focus on products using materials of concern and demand for more environmentally friendly products, and for products incorporating digital capabilities, as well as changes in the ways healthcare services are delivered (including the transition of more care from acute to non-acute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management). The shift of care from acute to non-acute settings may also place financial pressure on hospitals and broader healthcare systems that could result in less demand for our products and services. Cost containment efforts by governments and the private sector are also resulting in increased emphasis on products that reduce costs, improve clinical results and expand patient access. Changes in regulatory or market standards, including without limitation cybersecurity requirements, often require significant investment to maintain compliance to relevant standards. Our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we meet these changing market and regulatory demands in terms of our product offerings and go-to-market approaches.\nThe medical technology industry is also subject to rapid technological change, discovery and frequent product introductions. The development of new or improved products, processes or technologies by other companies (such as needle-free injection technology or novel medical therapies) that provide better features, pricing, clinical outcomes or economic value may render our current products or subsequently developed products obsolete or less competitive. In some instances, competitors, including pharmaceutical companies, also offer (or are attempting to develop) alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device. Lower cost producers have also created pricing pressure, particularly in developing markets.\nThe medical technology industry has also experienced a significant amount of consolidation, resulting in companies with greater scale and market presence than BD. Traditional distributors are also manufacturers of medical devices, providing another source of competition. In addition, healthcare systems and other providers are consolidating, resulting in greater purchasing power for these companies. As a result, competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services has increased. Group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have also served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device suppliers. Further consolidation in the industry could intensify competition among medical device suppliers and exert additional pressure on the demand for and prices of our products.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risk.\nA substantial amount of our revenue is derived from international operations, and we anticipate that a significant portion of our future sales will continue to come from outside the U.S. The revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the U.S. have been and may continue to be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which are caused by a number of factors, including changes in a country's political and economic policies and inflationary conditions. Furthermore, currency exchange rates have been especially volatile in the recent past, and these currency fluctuations have affected, and may continue to affect, the reported value of our assets and liabilities, as well as our cash flows. A discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any exchange rate hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can effectively mitigate these risks.\nMarket dynamics, changes in reimbursement practices and coverage policies and third-party payer cost containment measures could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold.\nThe sale of our products and market access to BD products and services depends, in part, on the healthcare funding landscape as well as how healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by public and private payers. Coverage policies and reimbursement levels can vary across the payer community globally, regionally, and locally, and may affect which products customers purchase, the market acceptance rate for new technologies and the prices customers are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction. Furthermore, any changes to the coverage or reimbursement landscape, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products, which could adversely affect customer demand, or the price customers are willing to pay for such products. See Third-Party Reimbursement under Item 1. Business.\nA global trend towards limiting growth of healthcare costs may also put industry-wide pressure on medical device or clinical diagnostic pricing. In the U.S., these include value-based purchasing and managed care arrangements. Governments in China and other countries are also using various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures, including increased use of competitive bidding and tenders as well as price regulation, such as volume-based procurement programs (VoBP), which have unfavorably impacted our revenues and may continue to impact our results of operations in certain countries.\nOur future growth is dependent in part upon the development of new products, and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed.\nA significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on innovation and new product development. New product development requires significant investment in R&D, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to anticipate customer needs, innovate and develop new products and technologies, successfully complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the U.S. and abroad, manufacture products in a cost-effective manner, obtain appropriate intellectual property protections, and gain and maintain market acceptance of our products. In addition, patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product. There can be no assurance that any products now in development, or that we may seek to develop in the future, will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. If we are unable to develop and launch new products, our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the markets in which we participate may be negatively impacted. Even if we successfully develop new products or enhancements or new generations of existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry or regulatory standards, or competitors innovations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, including COVID-19, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The nature and extent of future impacts are highly uncertain and unpredictable.\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, including COVID-19, which could result in reductions in the demand for certain of our products. While the direct impact of COVID-19 and many of the preventive measures moderated in FY2023, any resurgence of COVID-19, or the outbreak of any other epidemic or pandemic, or the reinstatement of similar preventive measures in the future could negatively impact the global economy and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, public health crises and the resulting volatility in supply and demand may impact our global supply chain network, including shortages in supply or disruptions or delays in shipments, as well as price increases, of certain materials or components used in our products and increases in transportation costs. The COVID-19 pandemic changed the ways healthcare services are delivered due to budget constraints and staffing shortages, particularly shortages of nursing staff, which could impact the future demand for our products and services.\nThe scope and duration of any future public health crisis, including the potential emergence of new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the pace at which government restrictions are imposed and lifted, the scope of additional actions taken to mitigate the spread of disease, global vaccination and booster rates, the speed and extent to which global markets and utilization rates for our products fully recover from the disruptions caused by such a public health crisis, and the impact of these factors on our business, financial condition and results of operations, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.\nTo the extent COVID-19 or other public health crises adversely affect our operations and global economic conditions more generally, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.\nReductions in customers research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our business.\nWe sell products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government laboratories and private foundations. Research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions. A number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from U.S. government agencies, such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health and similar agencies in other countries. The level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable. The availability of governmental research funding may be adversely affected by economic conditions and governmental spending reductions, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. Any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products.\nWe need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives, key employees and other associates. Competition for experienced employees, particularly for persons with certain technical competencies in some geographies, can be a challenge. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical, manufacturing and distribution experience to operate our business successfully. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including how BDs compensation, benefits, work location, corporate culture and work environment compares with those offered by our competitors and other local employers. While there has been a slight improvement in what had been an intensely competitive labor market, there continues to be pressure on skilled labor in certain markets. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base has lead to, and may continue to lead to, increased costs, such as an increase in overtime necessary to meet demand and increased wages and benefit costs to attract and retain skilled employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and skilled employees, we could encounter operational disruptions or other negative consequences to our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe military conflict between Russia and Ukraine may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe military conflict in Ukraine has increased global economic and political uncertainty. Furthermore, governments in the U.S., United Kingdom, and European Union have each imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia, and additional controls and sanctions could be enacted in the future. We continue to actively monitor the situation in Russia and Ukraine and assess its impact on our business, including our suppliers and customers. We have no manufacturing facilities or significant operations in Russia or Ukraine and as such, to date, the conflict has not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, it is possible that the conflict in Ukraine may escalate or expand, and the scope, extent and duration of the military action, current or future sanctions and resulting market and geopolitical disruptions could be significant. We cannot predict the impact the conflict may have on the global economy or our business, financial condition and operations in the future. The Russia and Ukraine conflict may also heighten the impact of other risks factors described herein. These potential effects could include but are not limited to increased inflation, volatility in prices for transportation, energy, commodities and other raw materials, constraints on the availability for us and our\nsuppliers of commodities and other raw materials, including cobalt and energy sources, disruptions in the global supply chain, decreased demand for certain of our products, disruptions to our global technology infrastructure, including through cyberattacks, ransom attacks or cyber-intrusion, adverse changes in international trade policies and relations, increased exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, and constraints, volatility or disruptions in the credit and capital markets.\nOperational Risks\nBreaches or breakdowns of our information and technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe use a large number of information and technology systems to operate our business. We process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations, including sensitive personal or proprietary information. In addition, we rely on networks and services, including internet sites, cloud and software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions, platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions, data hosting and processing facilities, tools and other hardware, software (including open-source software) and technical applications and platforms, including some that are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-party providers, to assist in conducting our business. Some of our products include information systems that collect data regarding patients and patient therapy on behalf of our customers and some connect to our systems for maintenance purposes.\nCyberattacks continue to increase in frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect for periods of time, especially as they relate to attacks on third-party providers or their vendors. Such attacks are often carried out by motivated and highly skilled actors, who are increasingly well-resourced. Our information systems, as well as those of various third parties on which we rely, have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, a variety of cybersecurity attacks including, but not limited to, unauthorized access, malicious code execution and/or phishing- attacks. Geopolitical events have also increased cybersecurity risks on a global basis. In this increasingly hostile environment, we, or our third-party providers, could suffer a loss or disclosure of certain business information (or information regarding third parties stored in our systems) due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches. These breaches and cyberattacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential or proprietary information being accessed, destroyed or stolen, which could adversely affect our competitive position in the market. Likewise, we or our third-party providers could suffer disruption of our operations and other significant negative consequences, including increased costs for security measures or remediation, lost revenue, manufacturing challenges or disruption, diversion of management attention, reputational damage, litigation and damage to our relationships with vendors, business partners and customers.\nUnauthorized tampering, adulteration or interference with our products may also create issues with product functionality that could result in a loss of data, risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions. Cyberattacks could also result in unauthorized access to our systems and products, which could impact our compliance with privacy and other laws and regulations and could result in actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation.\nCyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated, frequent and adaptive. While we have made investments to address these threats and continue to dedicate significant resources to protect against unauthorized access of our systems and products, and we continue to work with government authorities and third-party providers to detect and reduce the risk of future cyber incidents, there can be no assurances that these protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nCost volatility could adversely affect our operations.\nOur results of operations could be negatively impacted by volatility in the cost of raw materials, components, labor, freight and energy that, in turn, increases the costs of producing and distributing our products. New laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy and transportation costs, as well as the costs of certain raw materials and components. In particular, we purchase supplies of resins, which are oil-based components used in the manufacture of certain products, and any significant increases in resin costs, whether due to inflationary pressure, supply constraints, regulatory changes\nor otherwise, could adversely impact future operating results. Increases in oil prices can also increase our packaging and transportation costs. The costs of raw materials, transportation, construction, services, and energy necessary for the production and distribution of our products continues to increase and be volatile. These prices may continue to fluctuate based on many factors beyond our control, including but not limited to, changes in general economic conditions, labor costs, transportation costs, competition and currency exchange rates. While we have implemented cost containment measures, selective price increases and taken other actions to mitigate these inflationary pressures in our supply chain, we may not be able to completely offset all the increases in our operational costs.\nA reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe purchase many different types of raw materials and components used in our products, some of which are not available from multiple sources. In addition, for quality assurance, cost-effectiveness and other reasons, certain raw materials and components are purchased from sole suppliers. The price and supply of these materials and components may be impacted or disrupted for reasons beyond our control, including supplier shutdowns, supplier capacity constraints, supplier insolvencies, labor disruptions, transportation delays, inflationary pricing pressures, work stoppages, labor shortages, extreme weather events, geopolitical developments, global economic uncertainty or downturns, sanctions and trade restrictions, and other governmental regulatory actions (such as in the area of materials of concern). We have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant challenges to our global transportation channels and other aspects of our global supply chain network, including to the cost and availability of energy, raw materials and components due to shortages and cost inflation.\nWhile we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply and service, no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful. In addition, due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost. The termination, reduction or interruption in supply of these raw materials and components could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterruption of our manufacturing or sterilization operations could adversely affect our business.\nWe have manufacturing sites all over the world. In some instances, however, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants. Interruption to our manufacturing operations resulting from weather or natural disasters, regulatory requirements, equipment failure or other issues in our manufacturing process, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products. In some instances, we may not be able to transition manufacturing to other BD sites or a third party to replace the lost production. A significant interruption of our manufacturing operations could result in lost revenues and damage to our relationships with customers.\nIn addition, many of our products require sterilization prior to sale, and we utilize both BD facilities and third parties for this process. In some instances, only a few facilities are qualified under applicable regulations to conduct this sterilization. To the extent we or our third-party providers are unable to sterilize our products, whether due to lack of capacity, availability of materials for sterilization (including cobalt), regulatory requirements or otherwise, we may be unable to transition sterilization to other sites or modalities in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nAt a broader level, there is increased focus on the use and emission of ethylene oxide by the EPA and state environmental regulatory agencies. Additional regulatory requirements associated with the use and emission of ethylene oxide for sterilization may be imposed in the future, both domestically and outside the U.S. In April 2023, the EPA published proposed regulations relating to commercial sterilizers. We cannot predict what any final regulations adopted by the EPA may require and therefore we are not able to assess the impact they may have on our sterilization facilities, on the third-party sterilization facilities that BD utilizes or on our operations more generally. This increased regulation could require BD or sterilization service providers, including providers used by BD, to temporarily suspend operations to install additional emissions control\ntechnology, limit the use of ethylene oxide or take other actions, which would impact BDs operations and further reduce the available capacity to sterilize medical devices and healthcare products, and could also result in additional costs. If any existing regulatory requirements or any such regulatory actions or rulemaking result in the suspension or interruption of sterilization operations at BD or at medical device sterilizers used by BD, or otherwise limit the availability of third-party sterilization capacity, this could interrupt or otherwise adversely impact production of certain of our products or lead to civil litigation or other claims against BD. BD has business continuity plans in place to mitigate the impact of any such disruption, although these plans may not be able to fully offset such impact, for the reasons noted above. See Item 1. Business - Regulation for a discussion of the consent order BD entered into with the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the risk related to sterilization operations generally.\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere may present risks to our business and operations. Extreme weather or other conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, wildfires or flooding, which may result from climate change could adversely impact our operations and supply chain, including the availability and cost of raw materials and components required for the operation of our business, and human capital issues for BD and companies within our supply chain. In addition, access to and pricing of certain natural resources, such as water, could impact our manufacturing operations. Such conditions could also result in physical damage to our products, plants and distribution centers, as well as the infrastructure and facilities of our suppliers and of hospitals, medical care facilities and other customers.\nThere has been increased focus by federal, international, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies to combat and/or limit the effects of climate change through a variety of means, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions (and requirements to disclose climate-related risks and metrics, including greenhouse gas emissions), policies mandating or promoting the use of renewable or zero-carbon energy and sustainability initiatives, and additional taxes on fuel and energy. If legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the United States or in any other jurisdiction in which we do business that impose more stringent restrictions and requirements than our current legal or regulatory obligations, we and companies in our supply chain may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations, which could cause disruption in the sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, the impacts of climate change may further influence customer preferences and requirements, such as increased demand for products with lower environmental footprints, and for companies to produce and demonstrate progress against GHG reduction plans and targets. Failure to provide climate-friendly products or demonstrate GHG reductions could potentially result in loss of market share.\nLegal, Quality and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to lawsuits.\nWe are or have been a defendant in a number of lawsuits, including, among others, purported class action lawsuits for alleged antitrust violations and violations of federal securities laws, product liability claims (which may involve lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district litigation proceedings, including pending claims relating to our hernia repair implant products, surgical continence and pelvic organ prolapse products for women, vena cava filter products and implantable ports), and suits alleging patent infringement. We also are or have been subject to government subpoenas and civil investigative demands seeking information with respect to alleged violations of law, including in connection with federal and/or state healthcare programs (such as Medicare or Medicaid), federal contracting requirements and/or sales and marketing practices. A more detailed description of certain litigation to which we are a party is contained in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We could be subject to additional lawsuits, governmental investigations, subpoenas and civil investigative demands in the future. Any such lawsuits, governmental investigations, subpoenas and civil investigative demands could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could distract management from the operations of the business.\nReserves established for estimated losses with respect to legal proceedings do not represent an exact calculation of our actual liability, but instead represent our estimate of the probable loss at the time the reserve is established. Due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and our underlying loss reserve estimates, additional reserves may be established or current reserves may be significantly increased from time-to-time. Also, in some instances, we are not able to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party. In view of these uncertainties, we could incur charges materially in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, excess liability insurance. Any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nWith respect to certain litigation, we believe that some settlements and judgments, as well as legal defense costs, may be covered in whole or in part under applicable insurance policies with a limited number of insurance companies, or, in some circumstances, indemnification obligations owed to us by other parties. However, amounts recovered under these arrangements may be less than the stated coverage limits or less than otherwise expected and may not be adequate to cover damages and/or costs. In addition, there is no guarantee that insurers or other parties will pay claims or that coverage or indemnity will be otherwise available. Also, for certain product liability claims or lawsuits, BD does not maintain or has limited remaining insurance coverage, and we may not be able to obtain additional insurance on acceptable terms or at all that will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation.\nOur operations are global and are affected by complex state, federal and international laws relating to healthcare, environmental protection, occupational health and safety, antitrust, anti-corruption, marketing, fraud and abuse (including anti-kickback and false claims laws), export control, product safety and efficacy, employment, privacy and other areas. Violations of these laws can result in criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines and, in some cases, exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Environmental laws, particularly with respect to climate change and the emission of greenhouse gases, are also becoming more stringent throughout the world, which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate closures of, or changes to, our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers, or result in liability to BD. The enactment of additional laws and reporting requirements in the future or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations may increase our compliance costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations and financial performance.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Most of our products must receive clearance or approval from the FDA or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold. The process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may require us to incur significant costs in terms of time and resources, and these costs have been increasing due to increased requirements from the FDA and comparable governing bodies for supporting data for submissions. The regulatory process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of our products. Governmental agencies may also impose new requirements regarding registration, including, but not limited to, labeling updates or changes to prohibited materials that require us to modify or re-register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries.\nFollowing the introduction of a product, these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance. Our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices, adverse event reporting and other post market requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production, marketing or sale of our products and result in delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, warning letters or consent decrees, closure of manufacturing sites, import bans, seizures or recalls of products, civil or criminal sanctions and damage to our reputation. More stringent oversight by the FDA and other agencies in recent years has resulted in increased enforcement activity, which increases our compliance risk.\nWe are operating under an amended consent decree with the FDA, entered into by CareFusion in 2007 and amended in 2009, that affects our BD Alaris\u2122 infusion pump business in the U.S. We are also currently\noperating under a warning letter issued by the FDA. For more information regarding the consent decree and warning letter, see Regulation under Item 1. Business.\nAs previously disclosed, on July 21, 2023, BD received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its updated BD Alaris\u2122 Infusion System, which enables both remediation and a return to market for the BD Alaris\u2122 Infusion System. In accordance with our commitments to the FDA, all of the current BD Alaris\u2122 Infusion System devices in the U.S. market will be remediated or replaced with the updated 510(k) cleared version over the next several years. The overall timing and cost of replacement or remediation of the BD Alaris\u2122 Infusion Systems and return to market in the U.S. may be impacted by, among other things, customer readiness, supply continuity, and our continued engagement with the FDA.\nIn addition, the European Union (EU) has adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (the EU MDR) and the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the EU IVDR), each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical evidence requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. The EU MDR has been fully operational for previously approved self-certified medical devices since May 2021. In February 2023, the EU Parliament voted to extend the EU MDR transition timeline, which postpones application until 2027 for higher-risk Class III and implantable IIb devices (excluding WET devices) and 2028 for Class IIa, Class IIb (excluding Class IIb implantable non-WET devices), and Class I sterile devices or Class I devices with measuring function. This longer transition timeline applies only to devices that are transitioning to MDR and meet other specific conditions set out in the EU IVDR. The EU IVDR has been fully applicable for manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic medical devices since May 2022. Complying with and maintaining devices under these regulations requires us to incur significant expenditures. Additionally, the availability of EU notified body services certified to the new requirements is limited, which may delay the marketing approval for some of our products under the EU MDR. Any such delays, or any failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to EU conformity requirements.\nWe are also subject to complex and frequently changing privacy and data protection laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. as well as in all other regions where BD operates, regarding the collection, use, storage, transfer and other processing of personal information. These privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations, require changes to our policies, practices, and processes and in some cases impose restrictions on our use or storage of personal information. These limitations and restrictions could require us to modify current or future products or services, which may harm our future financial results. Any actual or perceived noncompliance with these laws, rules and regulations, our internal policies and procedures or our contracts governing the processing of personal information could result in significant consequences for BD, including, among other things, business interruption, sanctions and significant pecuniary fines, regulatory inquiries and investigations, adverse publicity, loss of competitive advantage and customer trust, as well as privacy litigation and civil lawsuits with damages.\nThe importance of privacy laws, rules and regulations for the healthcare and med-tech industry specifically is constantly growing, as personal data has become an integral part of doing business in our sector, and the legal standards are evolving and becoming more complex worldwide. For instance, the European General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR), applicable as of 2018 and still one of the strictest and most comprehensive privacy laws in the world, is being continuously enforced, and increasingly heavy fines for GDPR violations are now being levied on businesses. Fines for noncompliance with the GDPR can amount to up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover from the preceding financial year (whichever is higher) and may be imposed in conjunction with the exercise of the authoritys investigatory and corrective powers. The GDPRs extraterritorial scope makes it applicable to our U.S.-based legal entities whenever our business activities, systems and products process the personal data of EU residents. Additionally, privacy laws, rules and regulations are also rapidly developing in other countries and at the state level in the U.S. in parallel with federal privacy laws protecting sensitive health information. These varying laws, rules, regulations and industry standards impact BD businesses to the extent they rely on the use of personal data and create significant compliance challenges while maintaining our global reach. In addition, certain privacy and data protection laws may apply to us indirectly through our customers, manufacturers, suppliers or other third-party\npartners. For example, non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations by a third-party partner that is processing personal data on our behalf may be deemed non-compliance by us or a failure by us to conduct proper due diligence on the third party, which could result in material fines or litigation. We also could be subject to additional expenses and liabilities in the event of an information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of an information technology system owned or operated by us or a third party with which we partner or its vendor.\nDefects or quality issues associated with our products could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, component failures, unapproved or improper use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other serious adverse events. Such events have in the past and could in the future lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or as required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. A recall could result in significant costs and lost sales and customers, enforcement actions and/or investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of post-market approval requirements.\nOur operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets.\nMany of our businesses rely on patent, trademark and other intellectual property assets. These intellectual property assets, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business. We can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations, legal challenges or governmental action. Any patent applications we own or license may not result in patents being issued and any issued patents we obtain may not provide us with any competitive advantage. Furthermore, we may fail to accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable, and if we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. Patents attained by competitors, particularly as patents on our products expire, may also adversely affect our competitive position. Competitors may design around our intellectual property to develop competing technologies and products without infringing our intellectual property rights. In addition, competitors may seek to invalidate patents on our products or claim that our products infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate their intellectual property, which could result in a loss of competitive advantage or the payment of significant legal fees, damage awards and past or future royalties, as well as injunctions against future sales of our products. We also operate in countries that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the U.S., which could make it easier for competitors to compete with us in those countries.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants and other parties. These agreements may not adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors.\nThe loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings, financial condition or cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nWe may not be able to service all of our indebtedness.\nWe depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments. However, our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations of the combined Company and to utilize other methods to make scheduled payments will depend on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. There can be no assurance that these sources will be adequate. If we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, we will be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek additional capital, sell assets or refinance our indebtedness. Any such action may not\nbe successful and we may be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, we may not be able to refinance existing debt on favorable or comparable terms.\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness impose restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our businesses.\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur debt and the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, have liens on our property, and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person, engage in certain transactions with affiliates and change the nature of our business. In addition, the agreements also require us to comply with certain financial covenants, including financial ratios. Our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations.\nRisks Relating to the Spin-off of Embecta Corp.\nRisks relating to spin-off of Embecta Corp.\nOn April 1, 2022, we completed the spin-off of Embecta Corp. (Embecta) (NASDAQ: EMBC), which holds our former Diabetes Care business and is now one of the worlds largest pure-play diabetes management companies in the world. The spin-off is intended to be a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If any facts, assumptions, representations, and undertakings from BD and Embecta regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, the spin-off may not qualify for tax-free treatment, which could result in significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities for BD and its shareholders. Additionally, there can be no assurances that BD will be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from the spin-off.\nGeneral Business Risks\nWe cannot guarantee that any of our strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances will be successful.\nWe seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. Such transactions are inherently risky, and the integration of any newly-acquired business requires significant effort and management attention. The success of any acquisition, investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business. There can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful.\nNatural disasters, war and other events beyond our control could disrupt our business and adversely affect our future revenues and operating income.\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, wildfires and floods and other extreme weather events (including those caused by climate change), war, global health crises, terrorism, social or political unrest, labor disruptions and international conflicts and other events beyond our control, and actions taken by the U.S. and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events, could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the U.S. and areas outside of the U.S. in which we operate. These events could result in decreased demand for our products, adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities, or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers.\nInformation About our Executive Officers\nThe following is a list of the executive officers of BD, their ages and all positions and offices held by each of them during the past five years.

Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts. References to years throughout this discussion relate to our fiscal years, which end on September 30.\nCompany Overview\nDescription of the Company and Business Segments\nBecton, Dickinson and Company (BD) is a global medical technology company engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products used by healthcare institutions, physicians, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, the pharmaceutical industry and the general public. The Company's organizational structure is based upon three principal business segments, BD Medical (Medical), BD Life Sciences (Life Sciences) and BD Interventional (Interventional).\nBDs products are manufactured and sold worldwide. Our products are marketed in the United States and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to end-users by BD and independent sales representatives. We organize our operations outside the United States as follows: EMEA (which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa); Greater Asia (which includes countries in Greater China, Japan, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Korea, Australia and New Zealand); Latin America (which includes Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America); and Canada. We continue to pursue growth opportunities in emerging markets, which include the following geographic regions: Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and certain countries within Greater Asia. We are primarily focused on certain countries whose healthcare systems are expanding.\nStrategic Objectives\nBD remains focused on delivering durable growth, creating shareholder value and making appropriate investments for the future. BD 2025, our vehicle for value creation, is anchored in three key pillars: grow, simplify and empower. BD's management team aligns our operating model and investments with these key strategic pillars through continuous focus on the following underlying objectives:\nGrow\nDeveloping and maintaining a strong portfolio of leading products and solutions that address significant unmet clinical needs, improve outcomes, and reduce costs;\nFocusing on our core products, services and solutions that deliver greater benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchers;\nInvesting in research and development that leads to and expands category leadership, as well as results in a robust product pipeline;\nAccelerating innovation in smart devices, robotics, analytics, and artificial intelligence in order to enable new care settings, streamline care workflows and remove administrative burdens for healthcare providers;\nLeveraging our global scale in order to provide equitable access to affordable medical technologies around the world, including in under-resourced markets;\nSupplementing our internal growth through strategic acquisitions in faster growing market segments; and\nFocusing on cash management and an efficient capital structure in order to drive balance sheet productivity and strong shareholder returns.\nSimplify\nDriving operating effectiveness and margin expansion by increasing factory productivity and asset efficiencies;\nReducing complexity, increasing agility and improving customer experience by rationalizing our product portfolio, as well as by simplifying and optimizing our architecture and operating model;\nMaking strategic investments which prioritize a culture of quality and our quality management system to ensure we are a best-in-class, proactive quality-driven organization;\nEnhancing customer experiences through the digitalization of internal processes and go-to-market approaches;\nWorking across our supply chain to responsibly source materials and goods, as well as to reduce environmental impacts; and\nCreating more resilient operations through investments in an enterprise-wide renewable energy strategy.\nEmpower\nFostering a purpose-driven culture with a focus on positive impact to all stakeholders-customers, patients, employees, shareholders and communities;\nCultivating an inclusive work environment that welcomes and celebrates diverse backgrounds and perspectives;\nGrowing and enabling talent through training, development and reskilling strategies; and\nDriving sustainability initiatives within our organizational units to support enterprise-wide collaboration towards our sustainability strategy.\nIn assessing the outcomes of these strategies as well as BDs financial condition and operating performance, management generally reviews forecast data, monthly actual results, including segment sales, and other similar information. We also consider trends related to certain key financial data, including gross profit margin, selling and administrative expense, investment in research and development, return on invested capital, and cash flows.\nBDs Spin-Off of Diabetes Care and Sale of Surgical Instrumentation Platform\nOn April 1, 2022, we completed the spin-off of our former Diabetes Care business as a separate publicly traded company. The historical results of the Diabetes Care business that was contributed in the spin-off were reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2023, we completed the sale of the Interventional segment's Surgical Instrumentation platform. The historical financial results for this platform have not been classified as a discontinued operation. Additional disclosures regarding the spin-off and sale are provided in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nKey Trends Affecting Results of Operations\nOur operations, supply chain, suppliers and customers are exposed to various global macroeconomic factors. The factors which were most impactful to our fiscal year 2023 results included the following:\nInflation continued to drive higher costs of raw materials, electronic components, labor, energy, and logistical services. We expect inflation to persist into our fiscal year 2024, but at levels lower than our fiscal year 2023.\nA limited supply of skilled labor in certain markets drove higher overall labor costs, as noted above, and we expect labor availability will continue to be a macroeconomic challenge for our operations.\nThe availability of energy sources in certain markets, as well as the availability of certain raw materials and electronic components on a global basis.\nLogistics capacity constraints eased in our fiscal year 2023 compared to 2022 and lead times improved in most key routes. However, adequate supply of transportation capacity is critical to our operations and constrained capacity may unfavorably impact our results of operations.\nCurrent healthcare delivery has transitioned more care from acute to non-acute settings and has increased focus on chronic disease management; this transition has placed additional financial pressure on hospitals and the broader healthcare system. Healthcare institutions may take actions to mitigate any persistent pressures on their budgets and such actions could impact the future demand for our products and services. Additionally, a worsening of staffing shortages within healthcare systems may affect the prioritization of healthcare services, which could also impact the demand for certain of our products.\nCertain geopolitical conditions, including the evolving situations in Ukraine, the Middle East and Asia, may contribute to the macroeconomic conditions discussed above. While these geopolitical conditions have not materially impacted our results of operations to date, the continuation and/or an escalation of these evolving situations may further weaken the global economy and could result in additional inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints, including the unavailability and cost of energy.\nAdditionally, governments in China and other countries use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures, including increased use of competitive bidding and tenders as well as price regulation. During our fiscal year 2023, regional and national volume-based procurement programs (VoBP) established by the government in China unfavorably impacted our revenues and we anticipate that these programs may continue to impact our results of operations.\nWe continue to invest in research and development, strategic tuck-in acquisitions, geographic expansion, and new product programs to drive further revenue and profit growth. Our ability to sustain our long-term growth will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to expand our core business (including geographical expansion), develop innovative new products, and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness.\nWe have been mitigating the impacts of the macroeconomic and other factors discussed above through various strategies which leverage our procurement, logistics and manufacturing capabilities. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively mitigate these pressures in future periods and an inability to offset these pressures through our strategies, at least in part, could adversely impact our results of operations. Due to the significant uncertainty that exists relative to the duration and overall impact of the macroeconomic and other factors discussed above, our future operating performance, particularly in the short-term, may be subject to volatility. The impacts of macroeconomic and other conditions on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows are dependent on certain factors, including those discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nSummary of Financial Results\nWorldwide revenues in 2023 of $19.372 billion increased 2.7% from the prior-year period. This increase reflected the following impacts:\nIncrease (decrease) in current-period revenues\nVolume/other 3.0 %\nPeriod-over-period decline in revenues related to COVID-19-only testing (2.3) %\nPricing 3.8 %\nForeign currency translation (1.8) %\nIncrease in revenues from the prior-year period\n2.7 %\nOur fiscal year 2023 revenues reflected sales in our Life Sciences segment related to COVID-19-only diagnostic testing on the BD VeritorTM Plus and BD MaxTM Systems of $73 million, compared with revenues from such testing products in 2022 of $511 million.\nOur financial position remains strong, with cash flows from continuing operating activities totaling $2.990 billion in 2023. At September 30, 2023, we had $1.489 billion in cash and equivalents and short-term investments, including restricted cash. We continued to return value to our shareholders in the form of dividends. During fiscal year 2023, we paid cash dividends of $1.114 billion, including $1.046 billion paid to common shareholders and $68 million paid to preferred shareholders.\nEach reporting period, we face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period. A stronger U.S. dollar, compared to the prior-year period, resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact to our revenues and earnings during our fiscal year 2023. We evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currency-neutral basis, which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results on a foreign currency-neutral basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Foreign currency-neutral (\"FXN\") information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a foreign currency-neutral basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. We calculate foreign currency-neutral percentages by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior-period foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current-period results. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Results on a foreign currency-neutral basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nResults of Operations\nMedical Segment\nThe following summarizes Medical revenues by organizational unit:\n2023 vs. 2022 2022 vs. 2021\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2021 Total\nChange Estimated\nFX\nImpact FXN Change Total\nChange Estimated\nFX\nImpact FXN Change\nMedication Delivery Solutions $ 4,293 $ 4,308 $ 4,101 (0.3) % (1.9) % 1.6 % 5.0 % (1.8) % 6.8 %\nMedication Management Solutions 2,980 2,533 2,432 17.6 % (1.0) % 18.6 % 4.1 % (1.5) % 5.6 %\nPharmaceutical Systems 2,229 2,001 1,828 11.4 % (1.7) % 13.1 % 9.5 % (5.0) % 14.5 %\nTotal Medical revenues $ 9,502 $ 8,841 $ 8,361 7.5 % (1.6) % 9.1 % 5.7 % (2.4) % 8.1 %\nThe Medical segments revenue growth in 2023 reflected the following.\nStrong global sales of catheters and other vascular care products in the Medication Delivery Solutions unit were partially offset by the impact of VoBP in China and lower COVID vaccination-related revenues in 2023 compared with these revenues in 2022.\nStrong performance of the Medication Management Solutions units pharmacy automation portfolio, including Parata Systems, which we acquired in fiscal year 2022, and our BD Rowa\u2122 technologies, as well as strong growth in sales of dispensing systems.

The counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nBD and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout Europe, Greater Asia, Canada and Latin America. We face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency. These payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions. We hedge substantially all such exposures, primarily through the use of forward contracts. We have also hedged the currency exposure associated with investments in certain foreign subsidiaries with instruments such as foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps, which are designated as net investment hedges, as well as currency exchange contracts. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations, including sales, to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period. We did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows against these foreign currency fluctuations in fiscal year 2023 or 2022.\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. For foreign currency derivatives, market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs, specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities.\nWith respect to the foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding at September 30, 2023 and 2022, the impact that changes in the U.S. dollar would have on pre-tax earnings was estimated as follows:\nIncrease (decrease)\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022\n10% appreciation in U.S. dollar $ (100) $ (63)\n10% depreciation in U.S. dollar $ 100 $ 63\nThese calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWhen managing interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments. We may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interest-bearing investments in tandem, since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure. For interest rate derivative instruments, fair values are measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows using market-based observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate yield curves. Market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities.\nThe impact that changes in interest rates would have on interest rate derivatives outstanding at September 30, 2023 and 2022, as well as the effect that changes in interest rates would have on our earnings or cash flows over a one-year period, based upon our overall interest rate exposure, were estimated as follows:\nIncrease (decrease) to fair value of interest rate derivatives outstanding Increase (decrease) to earnings or cash flows\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2023 2022\n10% increase in interest rates $ (3) $ (4) $ 2 $ (1)\n10% decrease in interest rates $ 2 $ 4 $ (2) $ 1\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur strong financial position and cash flow performance have provided us with the capacity to accelerate our innovation pipeline through investments in research and development, as well as through strategic acquisitions. We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents, our ability to generate operating cash flow, and if needed, our access to borrowings from our financing facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our foreseeable operating needs. The following table summarizes our consolidated statement of cash flows in 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2021\nNet cash provided by (used for) continuing operations\nOperating activities $ 2,990 $ 2,471 $ 4,126\nInvesting activities $ (716) $ (3,220) $ (1,843)\nFinancing activities $ (1,956) $ (736) $ (3,306)\nNet Cash Flows from Continuing Operating Activities\nCash flows from continuing operating activities in 2023 reflected net income, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net use of cash, which was significantly lower than the net use of cash in 2022 due to efforts in 2023 to optimize inventory levels. The net use of cash in 2023 primarily reflected lower levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses, as well as higher levels of trade receivables, partially offset by lower levels of prepaid expenses.\nCash flows from continuing operating activities in 2022 reflected net income, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net use of cash. This net use of cash primarily reflected higher levels of inventory and prepaid expenses, as well as lower levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses. Cash flows from continuing operating activities in 2022 additionally reflected a discretionary cash contribution of $134 million to fund our pension obligation.\nCash flows from continuing operating activities in 2021 reflected higher net income, which was driven by strong revenue performance, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net source of cash. This net source of cash primarily reflected higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by higher levels of prepaid expenses, inventory and trade receivables. Cash flows from continuing operating activities in 2021 additionally reflected a $16 million discretionary cash contribution to fund our pension obligation.\nNet Cash Flows from Continuing Investing Activities\nCapital expenditures\nOur investments in capital expenditures are focused on projects that enhance our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities, as well as support our BD 2025 strategy for growth and simplification. Capital expenditures of $874 million, $973 million and $1.194 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily related to manufacturing capacity expansions. Details of spending by segment are contained in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nAcquisitions\nCash outflows for acquisitions in 2022 included a cash payment of $1.548 billion associated with our acquisition of Parata Systems in the fourth quarter of 2022, as well as cash payments relating to various strategic acquisitions we have executed as part of our growth strategy, including our acquisitions of MedKeeper, Scanwell Health, Inc, Tissuemed, Ltd., and Venclose, Inc. Cash outflows for acquisitions in 2021 included a cash payment relating to the strategic acquisition of Tepha, Inc.\nDivestitures\nCash inflows relating to our divestiture of the Interventional segment's Surgical Instrumentation platform in 2023 were $540 million. For further discussion, refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nNet Cash Flows from Continuing Financing Activities\nNet cash from continuing financing activities in 2023, 2022 and 2021 included the following significant cash flows:\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2021\nCash inflow (outflow)\nChange in short-term debt $ (230) $ 230 $ -\nProceeds from long-term debt $ 1,662 $ 497 $ 4,869\nDistribution from Embecta Corp. (see Note 2) $ - $ 1,266 $ -\nNet transfer of cash to Embecta upon spin-off $ - $ (265) $ -\nPayments of debt $ (2,155) $ (805) $ (5,112)\nShare repurchases $ - $ (500) $ (1,750)\nDividends paid $ (1,114) $ (1,082) $ (1,048)\nAdditional disclosures regarding the equity and debt-related financing activities detailed above are provided in Notes 4 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nDebt-Related Activities\nCertain measures relating to our total debt were as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\nTotal debt (Millions of dollars) $ 15,879 $ 16,065 $ 17,610\nWeighted average cost of total debt 3.0 % 2.8 % 2.4 %\nTotal debt as a percentage of total capital (a) 37.2 % 37.3 % 41.1 %\n(a) Represents shareholders equity, net non-current deferred income tax liabilities, and debt.\nAdditional disclosures regarding our debt instruments are provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nCash and Short-term Investments\nAt September 30, 2023, total worldwide cash and equivalents and short-term investments, including restricted cash, were $1.489 billion. These assets were largely held in the United States. We regularly review the amount of cash and short-term investments held outside of the United States and our historical foreign earnings are used to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment expenditure needs. To fund cash needs in the United States, we rely on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and remittances from foreign subsidiaries of earnings that are not considered to be permanently reinvested.\nFinancing Facilities\nWe have a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility in place which will expire in September 2026. The credit facility, which was amended and restated in January 2023, provides borrowings of up to $2.750 billion, with separate sub-limits of $100 million and $194 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively. The expiration date of the credit facility may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods, subject to certain restrictions (including the consent of the lenders). The credit facility provides that we may, subject to additional commitments by lenders, request an additional $500 million of financing, for a maximum aggregate commitment under the credit facility of up to $3.250 billion. Proceeds from this facility\nmay be used for general corporate purposes and Becton Dickinson Euro Finance S.\u00e0 r.l., an indirect, wholly owned finance subsidiary of BD, is authorized as an additional borrower under the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at September 30, 2023.\nThe agreement for our revolving credit facility contains the following financial covenants. We were in compliance with these covenants, as applicable, as of September 30, 2023.\nWe are required to have a leverage coverage ratio of no more than:\n\u25e64.25-to-1 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter following the closing of the credit facility; or\n\u25e64.75-to-1 for the four full fiscal quarters following the consummation of a material acquisition.\nWe may access commercial paper programs over the normal course of our business activities. In March 2023, we amended the agreement for our U.S. commercial paper program. The amendment provided, among other things, an increase of the maximum amount of unsecured borrowings available under the program to $2.750 billion. Also in March 2023, we entered into an agreement to establish a multicurrency euro commercial paper program. This multicurrency program allows for a maximum amount of unsecured borrowings that, when aggregated with the amount outstanding under the U.S. commercial paper program, will not exceed $2.750 billion at any time. Proceeds from these programs may be used for working capital purposes and general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions, share repurchases and repayments of debt. We had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2023. We have additional informal lines of credit outside the United States. Also, over the normal course of our business activities, we transfer certain trade receivable assets to third parties under factoring agreements. Additional disclosures regarding sales of trade receivable assets are provided in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nAccess to Capital and Credit Ratings\nOur corporate credit ratings with the rating agencies Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P), Moody's Investor Service (Moody's) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) were as follows at September 30, 2023:\nS&P Moodys Fitch\nRatings:\nSenior Unsecured Debt BBB Baa2 BBB\nCommercial Paper A-2 P-2\nOutlook Stable Stable Stable\nOur corporate credit ratings at September 30, 2023 were unchanged compared with our ratings at September 30, 2022. S&P, Moodys and Fitch assigned ratings of A-2, P-2 and, respectively, to the multicurrency euro commercial paper program we entered into in March 2023. These ratings were consistent with the ratings already assigned to our U.S. commercial paper program.\nLower corporate debt ratings and downgrades of our corporate credit ratings or other credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing. We believe that given our debt ratings, our financial management policies, our ability to generate cash flow and the non-cyclical, geographically diversified nature of our businesses, we would have access to additional short-term and long-term capital should the need arise. A rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. Information regarding our obligations under purchase, debt and lease arrangements are provided in Notes 6, 16 and 18, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe following discussion supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. For any given estimate or assumption made by management, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. Actual results that differ from managements estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements:\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are primarily recognized when the customer obtains control of the product sold, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms specified in the sales agreement. Revenues associated with certain instruments and equipment for which installation is complex, and therefore significantly affects the customers ability to use and benefit from the product, are recognized when customer acceptance of these installed products has been confirmed. For certain service arrangements, including extended warranty and software maintenance contracts, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. The majority of revenues relating to extended warranty contracts associated with certain instruments and equipment is generally recognized within a few years whereas deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts is generally recognized over a longer period.\nOur agreements with customers within certain organizational units including Medication Management Solutions, Integrated Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences, contain multiple performance obligations including both products and certain services noted above. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require judgment. The transaction price for these agreements is allocated to each performance obligation based upon its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling price is the amount at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. We generally estimate standalone selling prices using list prices and a consideration of typical discounts offered to customers. The use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.\nOur gross revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, including rebates. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and judgment is required when determining the impact on gross revenues for a reporting period. Additional factors considered in the estimate of our rebate liability include the quantification of inventory that is either in stock at or in transit to our distributors, as well as the estimated lag time between the sale of product and the payment of corresponding rebates.\nImpairment of Assets\nGoodwill assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually, or whenever indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with finite lives, including developed technology, and other long-lived assets, are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Our reporting units represent one level below reporting segments. Our review of goodwill for each reporting unit compares the fair value of the reporting unit, estimated using an income approach, with its carrying value. Our annual goodwill impairment\ntest performed on July 1, 2023 did not result in any impairment charges, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.\nWe generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures the value of our income producing assets. This approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, appropriate discount rates, terminal values and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with BDs business plans. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset. Actual results may differ from managements estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nBD maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.\nBD conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, we record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions, our past audit experience with similar situations, and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters. BDs effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if, upon resolution with taxing authorities, we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established, or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves.\nWe have reviewed our needs in the United States for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and we continue to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the United States to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment expenditure needs. As a result, we are permanently reinvested with respect to all of our historical foreign earnings as of September 30, 2023. Additional disclosures regarding our accounting for income taxes are provided in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nContingencies\nWe are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, product liability and environmental matters, as further discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. We establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable (and in the case of environmental matters, without considering possible third-party recoveries). A determination of the amount of accruals for these contingencies is made after analysis of each individual matter. When appropriate, the accrual is developed with the consultation of outside counsel and, in the case of certain mass tort litigation, actuarial specialists regarding the nature, timing and extent of each matter. The accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our litigation strategy. We record expected recoveries from product liability insurance carriers or other parties when realization of recovery is deemed probable.\nGiven the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party. In view of these uncertainties, we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, liability insurance. In the opinion of management, any such future charges, individually or in the\naggregate, could have a material adverse effect on BDs consolidated results of operations, financial condition and/or consolidated cash flows.\nBenefit Plans\nWe have significant net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations that are measured using actuarial valuations which include assumptions for the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion.\nThe discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date (September 30). Specifically for the U.S. plans, we will use a discount rate of 6.01% for 2024, which was based on an actuarially-determined, company-specific yield curve to measure liabilities as of the measurement date. To calculate the pension expense in 2024, we will apply the individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost. Additional disclosures regarding the method to be used in calculating the interest cost and service cost components of pension expense for 2024 are provided in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, although reviewed each year, changes less frequently due to the long-term nature of the assumption. This assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date; rather, it is used only in the calculation of pension expense. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider many factors, including our historical assumptions compared with actual results; benchmark data; expected returns on various plan asset classes, as well as current and expected asset allocations. We will use a long-term expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 7.5% for the U.S. pension plan in 2024. We believe our discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors.\nSensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our U.S. pension and other postretirement and postemployment plans are as follows:\nDiscount rate - A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $5 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the total U.S. net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan costs. This estimate assumes no change in the shape or steepness of the company-specific yield curve used to plot the individual spot rates that will be applied to the future cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost.\nExpected return on plan assets - A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $3 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on U.S. pension plan costs.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. BD and its representatives may also, from time to time, make certain forward-looking statements in publicly released materials, both written and oral, including statements contained in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, and our reports to shareholders. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as plan, expect, believe, intend, will, may, anticipate, estimate and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations and financial performance (including volume growth, pricing, sales and earnings per share growth, and cash flows) and statements regarding our strategy for growth, liquidity, future product development, regulatory approvals, competitive position and expenditures. All statements that address our future operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are, and will be, based on managements then-current views and\nassumptions regarding future events, developments and operating performance, and speak only as of their dates. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Furthermore, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law or regulations.\nThe following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements. For further discussion of certain of these factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report and our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.\nGeneral global, regional or national economic downturns and macroeconomic trends, including heightened inflation, capital market volatility, interest rate and currency rate fluctuations, and economic slowdown or recession, that may result in unfavorable conditions that could negatively affect demand for our products and services, impact the prices we can charge for our products and services, disrupt our supply chain. impair our ability to produce our products, or increase borrowing costs.\nThe impact of inflation and disruptions in our global supply chain on BD and our suppliers (particularly sole-source suppliers and providers of sterilization services), including fluctuations in the cost and availability of oil-based resins and other raw materials, as well as certain components, used in the production or sterilization of our products, transportation constraints and delays, product shortages, energy shortages or increased energy costs, labor shortages or disputes, and increased operating and labor costs.\nConditions in international markets, including social and political conditions, geopolitical developments such as the ongoing situations in Ukraine, the Middle East and Asia, civil unrest, terrorist activity, governmental changes, restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders, economic sanctions, export controls, tariffs and other protectionist measures and barriers to market participation (such as local company and products preferences), difficulties in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and governmental expropriation of assets. Our international operations also increase our compliance risks, including risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and bribery laws, as well as regulatory and privacy laws.\nCompetitive factors that could adversely affect our operations, including new product introductions and technologies (for example, new forms of drug delivery or novel medical therapies) by our current or future competitors, consolidation or strategic alliances among healthcare companies, distributors and/or payers of healthcare to improve their competitive position or develop new models for the delivery of healthcare, increased pricing pressure due to the impact of low-cost manufacturers, patents attained by competitors (particularly as patents on our products expire), new entrants into our markets and changes in the practice of medicine.\nChanges in the way healthcare services are delivered, including transition of more care from acute to non-acute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management, which may affect the demand for our products and services. Additionally, budget constraints and staffing shortages, particularly shortages of nursing staff, may affect the prioritization of healthcare services, which could also impact the demand for certain of our products and services.\nOur ability to achieve our projected level or mix of product sales, as our earnings forecasts are based on projected sales volumes and pricing of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others.\nChanges in the coverage or reimbursement landscape, or adverse decisions relating to our products by governments or third-party payers, which could reduce demand for our products or the price we can charge for such products.\nCost-containment efforts in the U.S. or in other countries in which we do business, such as alternative payment reform and increased use of competitive bidding and tenders, including, without limitation, any\nexpansion of the volume-based procurement process in China or the implementation of similar cost-containment efforts.\nRisks relating to our overall level of indebtedness, including our ability to service our debt and refinance our indebtedness, which is dependent upon the capital markets and the overall macroeconomic environment and our financial condition at such time.\nChanges in the domestic and foreign healthcare industry or in medical practices that result in a reduction in procedures using our products or increased pricing pressures, including cost-reduction measures instituted by and the continued consolidation among healthcare providers.\nThe effects of regulatory or other events (such as public health crises) that adversely impact our supply chain, including our ability to manufacture (including sterilize) our products (particularly where production of a product line or sterilization operations are concentrated in one or more plants), source materials or components or services from suppliers (including sole-source suppliers) that are needed for such manufacturing (including sterilization), or provide products to our customers, including events that impact key distributors. In particular, there has been increased regulatory focus on the use and emission of ethylene oxide in sterilization processes, and additional regulatory requirements have been proposed and may be imposed in the future that could adversely impact BD or our third-party sterilization providers.\nSecurity breaches of our information and technology systems or our products, which could impair our ability to conduct business, result in the loss of BD trade secrets or otherwise compromise sensitive information of BD or its customers, suppliers and other business partners, or of patients, including sensitive personal data, or result in product efficacy or safety concerns for certain of our products, and result in actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation.\nProduct efficacy or safety concerns regarding our products resulting in product holds or recalls, regulatory action on the part of the FDA or foreign counterparts (including restrictions on future product clearances and civil penalties), declining sales and product liability claims, and damage to our reputation. As a result of the CareFusion acquisition, our U.S. infusion pump business is operating under a Consent Decree with the FDA. The Consent Decree authorizes the FDA, in the event of any violations in the future, to order our U.S. infusion pump business to cease manufacturing and distributing products, recall products or take other actions, and order the payment of significant monetary damages if the business subject to the decree fails to comply with any provision of the Consent Decree. In accordance with our commitments to the FDA, the overall timing of replacement or remediation of the BD Alaris\u2122 Infusion Systems and return to market in the U.S. may be impacted by, among other things, customer readiness, supply continuity and our continued engagement with the FDA.\nDifficulties inherent in product development, including the potential inability to successfully continue technological innovation, successfully complete clinical trials, obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and registrations in the U.S. and abroad, obtain intellectual property protection for our products, obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for new products, or gain and maintain market approval of products, as well as the possibility of infringement claims by competitors with respect to patents or other intellectual property rights, all of which could preclude or delay commercialization of a product. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or clearances from the FDA or other regulatory agencies or changes in the regulatory process may also delay product launches and increase development costs.\nAny impact that public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, including COVID-19, may have on our business, the global economy and the global healthcare system. This may include decreases in the demand for our products, disruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers and customers, disruptions to our supply chain, or increases in transportation costs.\nThe impact of changes in U.S. federal or foreign laws and policies that could affect fiscal and tax policies, taxation (including tax reforms, such as the implementation of a global minimum tax, that could adversely impact multinational corporations), and international trade, including import and export\nregulation and international trade agreements. In particular, tariffs, sanctions or other trade barriers imposed by the U.S. or other countries could adversely impact our supply chain costs or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe risks associated with the spin-off of our former Diabetes Care business, including factors that could adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits of the spin-off, or the qualification of the spin-off as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe impact of business combinations or divestitures, including any volatility in earnings relating to acquisition-related costs, and our ability to successfully integrate any business we may acquire.\nOur ability to penetrate or expand our operations in emerging markets, which depends on local economic and political conditions, and how well we are able to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities and distribution networks.\nDeficit reduction efforts or other actions that reduce the availability of government funding for healthcare and research, which could weaken demand for our products and result in additional pricing pressures, as well as create potential collection risks associated with such sales.\nFluctuations in university or U.S. and international governmental funding and policies for life sciences research.\nOur ability to recruit and retain key employees and the impact of labor conditions which could increase employee turnover or increase our labor and operating costs and negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our business.\nFluctuations in the demand for products we sell to pharmaceutical companies that are used to manufacture, or are sold with, the products of such companies, as a result of funding constraints, consolidation or otherwise.\nThe impact of climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, such as regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, zero-carbon energy and sustainability mandates, and additional taxes on fuel and energy, and changing customer preferences and requirements, such as those regarding the use of materials of concern, increased demand for products with lower environmental footprints, and for companies to set and demonstrate progress against greenhouse gas reduction plans and targets.\nNatural disasters, including the impacts of hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, fires, earthquakes and floods and other extreme weather events, global health pandemics, war, terrorism, labor disruptions and international conflicts that could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability, resulting in decreased demand for our products, adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or cause interruptions in our supply chain.\nPending and potential future litigation or other proceedings asserting, and/or investigations concerning and/or subpoenas and requests seeking information with respect to, alleged violations of law (including in connection with federal and/or state healthcare programs (such as Medicare or Medicaid) and/or sales and marketing practices (such as investigative subpoenas and the civil investigative demands received by BD)), potential anti-corruption and related internal control violations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, antitrust claims, securities law claims, product liability (which may involve lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district litigation proceedings, including pending claims relating to our hernia repair implant products, surgical continence products for women, vena cava filter products and implantable ports), claims with respect to environmental matters, data privacy breaches and patent infringement, and the availability or collectability of insurance relating to any such claims.\nNew or changing laws and regulations affecting our domestic and foreign operations, or changes in enforcement practices, including, without limitation, laws relating to sales practices, environmental protection and reporting, price controls, privacy, cybersecurity, and licensing and regulatory\nrequirements for new products and products in the post-marketing phase. In particular, the U.S. and other countries may impose new requirements regarding registration, labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to re-register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products. Environmental laws, particularly with respect to the emission of greenhouse gases, are also becoming more stringent throughout the world, which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate changes in our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers, or result in liability to BD.\nThe effect of adverse media exposure or other publicity regarding BDs business or operations, including the effect on BDs reputation or demand for its products.\nThe effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in BDs pension plans and on actuarial interest rate and asset return assumptions, which could require BD to make additional contributions to the plans or increase our pension plan expense.\nOur ability to obtain the anticipated benefits of restructuring programs, if any, that we may undertake.\nIssuance of new or revised accounting standards by the FASB or the SEC.\nThe foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThe information required by this item is included in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in Notes 1, 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nReports of Management\nManagements Responsibilities\nThe following financial statements have been prepared by management in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include, where required, amounts based on the best estimates and judgments of management. The integrity and objectivity of data in the financial statements and elsewhere in this Annual Report are the responsibility of management.\nIn fulfilling its responsibilities for the integrity of the data presented and to safeguard the Companys assets, management employs a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance, at appropriate cost, that the Companys assets are protected and that transactions are appropriately authorized, recorded and summarized. This system of control is supported by the selection of qualified personnel, by organizational assignments that provide appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibilities, and by the dissemination of written policies and procedures. This control structure is further reinforced by a program of internal audits, including a policy that requires responsive action by management.\nThe Board of Directors monitors the internal control system, including internal accounting and financial reporting controls, through its Audit Committee, which consists of five independent Directors. The Audit Committee meets periodically with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and management to review the work of each and to satisfy itself that they are properly discharging their responsibilities. The independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee and meet with its members, with and without management present, to discuss the scope and results of their audits including internal control, auditing and financial reporting matters.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended. Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework).\nBased on the Company's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the criteria noted above, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023.\nThe financial statements and internal control over financial reporting have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Ernst & Youngs reports with respect to fairness of the presentation of the financial statements, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, are included herein.\n/s/ Thomas E. Polen /s/ Christopher J. DelOrefice /s/ Thomas J. Spoerel\nThomas E. Polen Christopher J. DelOrefice Thomas J. Spoerel\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer and President Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Senior Vice President and Controller, Chief Accounting Officer and International Chief Financial Officer\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Becton, Dickinson and Company (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of\nSeptember 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nEstimation of Product Liability Reserves\nDescription of the Matter As described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is a defendant in various product liability matters in which the plaintiffs allege a wide variety of claims associated with the use of certain Company devices. At September 30, 2023, the Companys product liability reserves totaled approximately $1.9 billion. The Company engaged an actuarial specialist to perform an analysis to estimate the outstanding liability for indemnity costs related to claims arising from certain of these product liability matters. The methods used by the Company to estimate these reserves are based on reported claims, historical settlement amounts, and stage of litigation, among other items.\nAuditing managements estimate of certain of the Companys product liability reserves and the related disclosure was challenging due to the significant judgment required to determine the methods used to estimate the amount of unreported product liability claims and the indemnity costs and the key assumptions utilized in those methods given the stages of these matters and the amount of claims history.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the Companys evaluation of certain product liability reserves. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the methods, significant assumptions and the underlying data used by the actuary to estimate the product liability reserves.\nTo evaluate managements estimate of certain product liability reserves, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by management's actuarial specialist to estimate the amount of unreported claims and the indemnity cost. For example, we compared filed and settled claims data to legal letters obtained from external counsel, and, on a sample basis, compared settlement amounts to the underlying agreements. In addition, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist us in evaluating the methods used to estimate the unreported claims and the indemnity cost used in the calculation of certain product liability reserves. We have also assessed the adequacy of the Companys disclosures in relation to these matters.\nIncome taxes - Uncertain tax positions\nDescription of the Matter As discussed in Notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company conducts business in numerous countries and as a result, files tax returns in those locations. Uncertain tax positions may arise for multiple reasons including, but not limited to, the interpretation of global tax rules and regulations. The Company uses judgment to (1) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. The Company has recorded a liability of $366 million related to uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2023.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty in predicting the resolution of these tax matters, auditing the Companys uncertain tax positions involved complex analysis and auditor judgment. This also required the use of tax subject matter resources to determine whether the more likely than not criteria was met.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over managements accounting for uncertain tax positions, including assessment of the technical merits of tax positions.\nTo evaluate whether the technical merits of uncertain tax positions are more likely than not sustainable, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluation of applicable tax law, tax regulations and other regulatory guidance by our tax subject matter professionals. We also involved our tax subject matter professionals in verifying our understanding of the relevant facts and analysis, by assessing the Companys correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and evaluating third-party advice obtained by the Company. We also evaluated the adequacy of the Companys income tax disclosures included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in relation to these matters.\n/s/\nERNST & YOUNG LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1959.\nNew York, New York\nNovember 21, 2023\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Becton, Dickinson and Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Becton, Dickinson and Company (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated November 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP\nNew York, New York\nNovember 21, 2023\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nYears Ended September 30\nMillions of dollars, except per share amounts 2023 2022 2021\nRevenues $ 19,372 $ 18,870 $ 19,131\nCost of products sold 11,202 10,393 10,500\nSelling and administrative expense 4,719 4,709 4,719\nResearch and development expense 1,237 1,256 1,279\nAcquisition-related integration and restructuring expense 313 192 179\nOther operating (income) expense, net (210) 37 203\nTotal Operating Costs and Expenses 17,261 16,588 16,881\nOperating Income 2,111 2,282 2,250\nInterest expense (452) (398) (469)\nInterest income 49 16 9\nOther expense, net (46) (117) (99)\nIncome from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes 1,662 1,783 1,692\nIncome tax provision 132 148 88\nNet Income from Continuing Operations 1,530 1,635 1,604\n(Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax (46) 144 488\nNet Income 1,484 1,779 2,092\nPreferred stock dividends (60) (90) (90)\nNet income applicable to common shareholders $ 1,424 $ 1,689 $ 2,002\nBasic Earnings per Share\nIncome from Continuing Operations $ 5.14 $ 5.42 $ 5.23\n(Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations (0.16) 0.50 1.69\nBasic Earnings per Share $ 4.97 $ 5.93 $ 6.92\nDiluted Earnings per Share\nIncome from Continuing Operations $ 5.10 $ 5.38 $ 5.18\n(Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations (0.16) 0.50 1.67\nDiluted Earnings per Share $ 4.94 $ 5.88 $ 6.85\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nYears Ended September 30\nMillions of dollars 2023 2022 2021\nNet Income $ 1,484 $ 1,779 $ 2,092\nOther Comprehensive (Loss) Income, Net of Tax\nForeign currency translation adjustments (91) 305 124\nDefined benefit pension and postretirement plans 4 210 255\nCash flow hedges 27 85 81\nOther Comprehensive (Loss) Income, Net of Tax (60) 600 460\nComprehensive Income $ 1,424 $ 2,379 $ 2,552\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nSeptember 30\nMillions of dollars, except per share amounts and numbers of shares 2023 2022\nAssets\nCurrent Assets\nCash and equivalents $ 1,416 $ 1,006\nRestricted cash 65 153\nShort-term investments 8 8\nTrade receivables, net 2,534 2,191\nInventories 3,273 3,224\nPrepaid expenses and other 1,380 1,559\nTotal Current Assets 8,676 8,141\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net 6,557 6,012\nGoodwill 24,522 24,621\nDeveloped Technology, Net 8,058 9,108\nCustomer Relationships, Net 2,338 2,683\nOther Intangibles, Net 552 519\nOther Assets 2,078 1,848\nTotal Assets $ 52,780 $ 52,934\nLiabilities and Shareholders Equity\nCurrent Liabilities\nCurrent debt obligations $ 1,141 $ 2,179\nAccounts payable 1,641 1,699\nAccrued expenses 2,604 2,605\nSalaries, wages and related items 1,115 1,171\nIncome taxes 139 157\nTotal Current Liabilities 6,641 7,811\nLong-Term Debt 14,738 13,886\nLong-Term Employee Benefit Obligations 1,023 902\nDeferred Income Taxes and Other Liabilities 4,582 5,052\nCommitments and Contingencies (See Note 6)\nShareholders Equity\nPreferred stock (See Note 4) - 2\nCommon stock - $1 par value: authorized - 640,000,000 shares;

Within the financial statements and tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts. Our fiscal year ends on September 30.\nOn April 1, 2022, the Company completed the spin-off of its Diabetes Care business as a separate publicly traded company. The historical results of the Diabetes Care business (previously included in BDs Medical segment) that was contributed to Embecta Corp (\"Embecta\") in the spin-off were reflected as discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Additional disclosures regarding the spin-off are provided in Note 2.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the Companys accounts and those of its majority-owned subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany transactions. The Company has no material interests in variable interest entities.\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at time of purchase.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash consists of cash restricted from withdrawal and usage and largely represents funds that are restricted for certain product liability matters, which are further discussed in Note 6.\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company grants credit to customers in the normal course of business and the resulting trade receivables are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents the Companys estimate of expected credit losses relating to trade receivables and is determined based on historical experience, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts and other specific account data. Amounts are written off against the allowances for doubtful accounts when the Company determines that a customer account is not collectable.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of approximate cost or net realizable value determined on the first-in, first-out basis.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are principally provided on the straight-line basis over estimated useful lives, which range from 20 to 45 years for buildings, four to 13 years for machinery and equipment and one to 20\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nyears for leasehold improvements. Depreciation and amortization expense was $696 million, $672 million and $689 million in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe Companys unamortized intangible assets include goodwill that arises from acquisitions of businesses. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment using quantitative models. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. The Companys reporting units represent one level below reporting segments. The Company reviews goodwill for each reporting unit by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit, estimated using an income approach, with its carrying value. The annual impairment review performed on July 1, 2023 indicated that all identified reporting units fair values exceeded their respective carrying values.\nAmortized intangible assets include developed technology assets which arise from acquisitions. These assets represent acquired intellectual property that is already technologically feasible upon the acquisition date or acquired in-process research and development assets that are completed subsequent to acquisition. Developed technology assets are generally amortized over periods ranging from 15 to 20 years, using the straight-line method. Customer relationship assets are generally amortized over periods ranging from 10 to 15 years, using the straight-line method. Other intangibles with finite useful lives, which include patents, are amortized over periods principally ranging from one to 40 years, using the straight-line method. Finite-lived intangible assets, including developed technology assets, are periodically reviewed when impairment indicators are present to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows. The carrying values of these finite-lived assets are compared to the undiscounted cash flows they are expected to generate and an impairment loss is recognized in operating results to the extent any finite-lived intangible assets carrying value exceeds its calculated fair value.\nForeign Currency Translation\nGenerally, foreign subsidiaries functional currency is the local currency of operations and the net assets of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. The U.S. dollar results that arise from such translation, as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature, are included in the foreign currency translation adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the customer obtains control of the product, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms specified in the sales agreement. Revenues associated with certain instruments and equipment for which installation is complex, and therefore significantly affects the customers ability to use and benefit from the product, are recognized upon customer acceptance of these installed products. Revenue for certain service arrangements, including extended warranty and software maintenance contracts, is recognized ratably over the contract term. When arrangements include multiple performance obligations, the total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. Variable consideration such as rebates, sales discounts and sales returns are estimated and treated as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized. These estimates are based on contractual terms, historical practices, and current trends, and are adjusted as new information becomes available. Revenues exclude any taxes that the Company collects from customers and remits to tax authorities.\nEquipment lease transactions with customers are evaluated and classified as either operating or sales-type leases. Generally, these arrangements are accounted for as operating leases and therefore, revenue is recognized at the contracted rate over the rental period defined within the customer agreement.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nAdditional disclosures regarding the Company's accounting for revenue recognition are provided in Note 7.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nThe Company considers its shipping and handling costs to be contract fulfillment costs and records them within Selling and administrative expense. Shipping expense was $733 million, $751 million and $641 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nContingencies\nThe Company establishes accruals for future losses which are both probable and can be reasonably estimated (and in the case of environmental matters, without considering possible third-party recoveries). Additional disclosures regarding the Company's accounting for contingencies are provided in Note 6.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nAll derivatives are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Any deferred gains or losses associated with derivative instruments are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized. The cash flows related to the Company's derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are reported as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash flows for all other derivatives, including undesignated hedges, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating or financing activities. Additional disclosures regarding the Company's accounting for derivative instruments are provided in Note 14.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has reviewed its needs in the United States for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and continues to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the United States to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment expenditure needs. As a result, the Company is permanently reinvested with respect to all of its historical foreign earnings as of September 30, 2023. Deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions, past audit experience with similar situations, and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters.\nThe Company maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in the tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. Additional disclosures regarding the Company's accounting for income taxes are provided in Note 17.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company has elected to account for its GILTI tax due as a period expense in the year the tax is incurred.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. In computing diluted earnings per share, only potential common shares that are dilutive (i.e., those that reduce earnings per share or increase loss per share) are included in the calculation.\nFair Value Measurements\nA fair value hierarchy is applied to prioritize inputs used in measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are detailed below. Additional disclosures regarding the Companys fair value measurements are provided in Notes 10 and 15.\nLevel 1 - Inputs to the valuation methodology which represent unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Inputs to the valuation methodology which include: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology which are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates or assumptions affect reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nNote 2 - Divestitures\nSurgical Instrumentation Platform\nThe Company completed the sale of its Interventional segment's Surgical Instrumentation platform in August 2023 pursuant to a definitive agreement that was signed in June 2023. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $268 million, which was recorded as a component of Other operating (income) expense, net in fiscal year 2023. The historical financial results for the Surgical Instrumentation platform have not been classified as a discontinued operation.\nSpin-Off of Embecta Corp.\nOn April 1, 2022, the Company completed the spin-off of its former Diabetes Care business as a separate publicly traded company named Embecta through a distribution of Embectas publicly traded common stock (listed on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol \"EMBC\") to BDs shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 22, 2022 (the record date). The Company distributed one share of Embecta common stock for every five common shares of BD outstanding as of the record date and shareholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares of Embecta common stock. BD retained no ownership interest in Embecta subsequent to the spin-off. The distribution is expected to qualify and has been treated as tax-free to the Company and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On March 31, 2022, Embecta used a portion of the proceeds from its financing transactions to make a cash distribution of approximately $1.266 billion to the Company. Additional disclosures regarding the various financing transactions entered into by Embecta and related to the spin-off are provided in Note 16.\nThe Company and Embecta entered into various agreements to effect the spin-off and provide a framework for the relationship between the Company and Embecta after the spin-off. Such agreements include the separation and distribution agreement, as well as the following ongoing agreements: a cannula supply agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement, a transition services agreement, manufacturing and\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nsupply agreements, a lease agreement, a distribution agreement to support commercial operations, a logistics services agreement and other agreements including an employee matters agreement and a tax matters agreement. Under these agreements, the Company will continue to provide certain products and services to Embecta following the spin-off. The agreements do not provide the Company with the ability to influence the operating or financial policies of Embecta subsequent to the spin-off date. Amounts included in the Companys consolidated statements of income during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 as a result of these agreements are detailed in Note 19.\nDetails of (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax, which represent the historical results of the Diabetes Care business prior to the spin-off date of April 1, 2022, are as follows:\nMillions of dollars 2022 2021\nRevenues $ 538 $ 1,117\nCost of products sold 143 320\nSelling and administrative expense 78 148\nResearch and development expense 32 59\nAcquisition-related integration and restructuring expense - 6\nOther operating expense, net 95 35\nTotal Operating Costs and Expenses 348 569\nOperating Income 190 549\nInterest expense (4) -\nOther income, net - 2\nIncome from Discontinued Operations Before Income Taxes 186 550\nIncome tax provision 42 62\nIncome from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax $ 144 $ 488\nIn fiscal year 2023, the Company recorded expenses of $46 million within (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax related to a foreign tax associated with the spin-off. For fiscal year 2022, in the table above, Other operating expense, net, includes $30 million of costs incurred by the Company to execute the spin-off and other costs for related residual activities, as well as $78 million of separation costs incurred by the Company prior to the spin-off date, including those for consulting, legal, tax and other advisory services associated with the spin-off.\nThe amounts of Revenues and Cost of products sold from discontinued operations detailed above include previously eliminated intercompany transactions that occurred between BD and Embecta which resulted in a third-party sale in the same period.\nNote 3 - Accounting Changes\nNew Accounting Principles Adopted\nOn July 1, 2022, the Company early-adopted an accounting standard update issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), which requires an entity to apply the provisions of Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" (\"ASC 606\") when recognizing and measuring contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination. The Companys adoption of this accounting standard update for business combinations that occurred during fiscal year 2022 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which requires earlier recognition of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by entities, including trade receivables. The new standard\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nrequires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at each reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Companys adoption of this accounting standard on October 1, 2020, using the modified retrospective method, did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nNew Accounting Principle Not Yet Adopted\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update that requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding supplier finance programs. The new disclosure requirements are intended to help investors better consider the effect of these programs on a company's working capital, liquidity, and cash flows. This update is effective for the Company in its first quarter of fiscal year 2024 and the Company is currently evaluating the impact this update will have on its disclosures.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nNote 4 - Shareholders Equity\nChanges in certain components of shareholders equity were as follows:\nCommon\nStock Issued\nat Par Value Capital in\nExcess of\nPar Value Retained\nEarnings Deferred\nCompensation Treasury Stock\n(Millions of dollars) Shares (in\nthousands) Amount\nBalance at September 30, 2020 $ 365 $ 19,270 $ 12,791 $ 23 (74,623) $ (6,138)\nNet income - - 2,092 - - -\nCash dividends:\nCommon ($3.32 per share)\n- - (958) - - -\nPreferred - - (90) - - -\nIssuance of shares under employee and other plans, net - (85) - - 1,068 15\nShare-based compensation - 237 - - - -\nCommon stock held in trusts, net (a) - - - - 33 -\nRepurchase of common stock - (150) - - (6,643) (1,600)\nEffect of change in accounting principle (see Note 3)\n- - (9) - - -\nBalance at September 30, 2021 $ 365 $ 19,272 $ 13,826 $ 23 (80,164) $ (7,723)\nNet income - - 1,779 - - -\nCash dividends:\nCommon ($3.48 per share)\n- - (992) - - -\nPreferred - - (90) - - -\nIssuance of shares under employee and other plans, net - (108) (1) - 1,271 44\nShare-based compensation - 239 - - - -\nCommon stock held in trusts, net (a) - - - - 25 -\nRepurchase of common stock - 150 - - (2,415) (650)\nSpin-off of Embecta (See Note 2)\n- - 634 - - -\nBalance at September 30, 2022 $ 365 $ 19,553 $ 15,157 $ 23 (81,283) $ (8,330)\nNet income - - 1,484 - - -\nCash dividends:\nCommon ($3.64 per share)\n- - (1,046) - - -\nPreferred - - (60) - - -\nIssuance of shares for preferred shares converted to common shares (b) 6 (4) - - - -\nIssuance of shares under employee and other plans, net - (88) - 1 1,056 24\nShare-based compensation - 259 - - - -\nCommon stock held in trusts, net (a) - - - - 24 -\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ 371 $ 19,720 $ 15,535 $ 24 (80,203) $ (8,305)\n(a)Common stock held in trusts consists of the Companys shares held in rabbi trusts in connection with deferred compensation under the Companys employee salary and bonus deferral plan and directors deferral plan.\n(b)Represents the conversion, in accordance with their terms, of 1.500 million mandatory convertible preferred shares that were issued in May 2020 were converted into 5.955 million shares of BD common stock on the mandatory conversion date of June 1, 2023.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nShare Repurchases\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company executed an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement in which 1.953 million common shares were repurchased and delivered in fiscal year 2022 for $500 million, which was recorded as an increase to Treasury stock.\nIn fiscal year 2021, the Company executed two ASR agreements to repurchase common shares totaling $1.250 billion, of which $1.100 billion settled in fiscal year 2021 and $150 million settled in fiscal year 2022. Total shares delivered in 2021 under the ASR agreements were 4.577 million shares. At September 30, 2021, the pending delivery of 462 thousand shares on one of the agreements was reflected as a decrease to Capital in excess of par value to recognize a net share-settled forward sale contract indexed to the Company's own common stock. Upon final settlement of the repurchase agreement and the forward sale contract during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, the final settlement amount was recorded as an increase to Treasury stock and an offsetting increase to Capital in excess of par value.\nThe Company also repurchased approximately 2.066 million shares of its common stock during fiscal year 2021 through open market repurchases, which were recorded as a $500 million increase to Treasury stock.\nIn November 2023, the Company executed ASR agreements to repurchase $500 million of its common stock and received an initial delivery of 1.718 million common shares, which will be recorded as an increase to Treasury stock in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024.\nThe share repurchases discussed above were made pursuant to the repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors on September 24, 2013 for 10 million shares, which has been fully utilized, and a repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in November 2021 for up to an additional 10 million shares of BD common stock, for which there is no expiration date.\nThe components and changes of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows:\n(Millions of dollars) Total Foreign\nCurrency\nTranslation Benefit Plans Cash Flow\nHedges\nBalance at September 30, 2020 $ (2,548) $ (1,416) $ (1,040) $ (91)\nOther comprehensive income before reclassifications, net of taxes 383 124 187 72\nAmounts reclassified into income, net of\ntaxes 77 - 68 9\nBalance at September 30, 2021 $ (2,088) $ (1,292) $ (784) $ (10)\nOther comprehensive income before reclassifications, net of taxes 306 54 169 83\nAmounts reclassified into income, net of\ntaxes 43 - 41 2\nSpin-off of Embecta (See Note 2)\n251 251 - -\nBalance at September 30, 2022 $ (1,488) $ (987) $ (574) $ 75\nOther comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications, net of taxes (106) (91) (37) 21\nAmounts reclassified into income, net of\ntaxes 46 - 41 6\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ (1,548) $ (1,078) $ (571) $ 103\nThe amount of foreign currency translation recognized in other comprehensive income during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 included net (losses) gains relating to net investment hedges, as further discussed in Note 14. Other comprehensive income relating to benefit plans during the year ended September 30, 2021 included a net gain of $24 million recognized as a result of the Companys remeasurement, as of October 31, 2020, of the legacy C.R. Bard, Inc. (Bard) U.S. defined pension benefit plan upon its merger\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nwith the BD defined benefit cash balance pension plan in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. The amounts recognized in other comprehensive income relating to cash flow hedges in 2023, 2022 and 2021 are primarily related to forward starting interest rate swaps. Additional disclosures regarding the Company's derivatives are provided in Note 14.\nThe tax impacts for amounts recognized in other comprehensive income before reclassifications were as follows:\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2021\nBenefit Plans\nIncome tax benefit (provision) for net (losses) gains recorded in other comprehensive income $ 15 $ (47) $ (42)\nThe tax impacts for cash flow hedges recognized in other comprehensive income before reclassifications in 2023, 2022 and 2021 were immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial results. The tax impacts for reclassifications out of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) relating to benefit plans and cash flow hedges in 2023, 2022 and 2021 were also immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial results.\nNote 5 - Earnings per Share\nThe weighted average common shares used in the computations of basic and diluted earnings per share (shares in thousands) for the years ended September 30 were as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\nAverage common shares outstanding 286,282 285,005 289,288\nDilutive share equivalents from share-based plans (a) (b) 2,110 2,333 2,801\nDilutive share equivalents from Series C preferred shares (c) - 26 -\nAverage common and common equivalent shares outstanding - assuming dilution 288,392 287,364 292,089\n(a)In 2023, 2022 and 2021, dilutive share equivalents associated with mandatory convertible preferred stock of 4 million, 6 million and 6 million, respectively, were excluded from the diluted shares outstanding calculation because the result would have been antidilutive. All of the mandatory convertible preferred shares outstanding were converted during fiscal year 2023, as further discussed in Note 4.\n(b)In 2021, 1 million of certain share-based compensation awards were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation as the exercise prices of these awards were greater than the average market price of the Companys common shares. In both 2023 and 2022, no such awards were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation. Additional disclosures regarding the Companys share-based compensation are provided in Note 9.\n(c)Represents dilutive share equivalents from Series C preferred shares that temporarily replaced shares of common stock held in trusts to adhere to trust requirements until the Companys spin-off of its Diabetes Care business on April 1, 2022 was completed.\nNote 6 - Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\nThe Company has certain future purchase commitments entered in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital requirements. As of September 30, 2023, these commitments aggregated to approximately $1.621 billion and will be expended over the next several years.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nContingencies\nThe Company is involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, product liability and environmental matters in certain U.S. and international locations. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, the Company is not able, in all cases, to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of litigation in which the Company is a party. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company establishes accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable (and in the case of environmental matters, without considering possible third-party recoveries). With respect to putative class action lawsuits in the United States and certain of the Canadian lawsuits described below, the Company is unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses for the following reasons: (i) all or certain of the proceedings are in early stages; (ii) the Company has not received and reviewed complete information regarding all or certain of the plaintiffs and their medical conditions; and/or (iii) there are significant factual issues to be resolved. In addition, there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of any class. With respect to the civil investigative demands (CIDs) served by the Department of Justice which are discussed below, the Company is unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses for the following reasons: (i) all or certain of the proceedings are in early stages; and/or (ii) there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved.\nProduct Liability Matters\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company is defending approximately 34,845 product liability claims involving the Companys line of hernia repair devices (collectively, the Hernia Product Claims). The Companys outstanding Hernia Product Claims as of September 30, 2022 were approximately 31,445. The Companys outstanding product liability claims represent nonhomogeneous populations of claims which vary widely based upon various factors, most notably the quality of the claims. As such, claim activity during any given period may not necessarily be indicative of the Companys ultimate liability under a mass tort matter. As further discussed below, the Companys underlying estimate of its product liability includes and already accounts for unfiled claims and as such, the net year-to-date change in the number of outstanding Hernia Product Claims did not materially impact the Companys product liability accrual as of September 30, 2023. The majority of the outstanding claims are currently pending in a coordinated proceeding in Rhode Island State Court (RI) and in a federal multi-district litigation (MDL) established in the Southern District of Ohio, but claims are also pending in other state and/or federal court jurisdictions. In addition, outstanding claims include multiple putative class actions in Canada. Generally, the Hernia Product Claims seek damages for personal injury allegedly resulting from use of the products. From time to time, the Company engages in resolution discussions with plaintiffs law firms regarding certain of the Hernia Product Claims, but the Company also intends to vigorously defend Hernia Product Claims that do not settle, including through litigation and trial. A trial for the Hernia Product Claims is currently scheduled in the MDL in April 2024.\nThe Company also continues to be a defendant in certain other mass tort litigation. As of September 30, 2023, the Company is defending product liability claims involving the Companys line of pelvic mesh products, the majority of which are pending in a coordinated proceeding in New Jersey Superior Court and in various federal court jurisdictions, and the Companys line of inferior vena cava (IVC) filter products, which are pending in various jurisdictions. Also, as of September 30, 2023, the Company is defending product liability claims involving its implantable ports, the majority of which are pending in an MDL formed on August 8, 2023 in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and is vigorously defending itself in these matters.\nIn most product liability litigations like those described above, plaintiffs allege a wide variety of claims, ranging from allegations of serious injury caused by the products to efforts to obtain compensation notwithstanding the absence of any injury. In many of these cases, the Company has not yet received and reviewed complete information regarding the plaintiffs and their medical conditions and, consequently, is unable to fully evaluate the claims. The Company expects that it will receive and review additional information regarding any remaining unsettled product liability matters.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nOther Legal Matters\nOn February 27, 2020, a putative class action captioned Kabak v. Becton, Dickinson and Company, et al., Civ. No. 2:20-cv-02155 (SRC) (CLW), now captioned Industriens Pensionsforsikring v. Becton, Dickinson and Company, et al., was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company and certain of its officers. The complaint, which purports to be brought on behalf of all persons (other than defendants) who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company's common stock from November 5, 2019 through February 5, 2020, asserts claims for purported violations of Sections 10 and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and seeks, among other things, damages and costs. The complaint alleges that defendants concealed certain material information regarding AlarisTM infusion pumps, allegedly rendering certain public statements about the Companys business, operations and prospects false or misleading, thereby allegedly causing investors to purchase stock at an inflated price. After an initial without prejudice dismissal, additional submissions were filed and the court permitted certain aspects of the case to proceed including claims asserted on behalf of option holders. In October 2023, an agreement in principle was reached to resolve this matter for an amount that is not material to the Companys consolidated financial results and for which it is adequately reserved; the terms of the settlement, including the amount, are subject to judicial approval.\nOn November 2, 2020, a putative shareholder derivative action captioned Jankowski v. Forlenza, et al., Civ. No. 2:20-cv-15474, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey by a shareholder, derivatively on behalf of the Company, against certain of the Companys directors and officers. The complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty; violations of sections 10(b), 14(a) and 21D of the Exchange Act, and insider trading. The complaint principally alleges, that the Company made misleading statements regarding AlarisTM infusion pumps in a proxy statement and other SEC filings. A second derivative action was filed on January 24, 2021, and the two actions were consolidated. In March 2021, the Company received letters from two additional shareholders which, in general, mirrored the allegations in the derivative actions, and demanded, among other things, that the Board of Directors pursue claims against members of management for claimed breaches of fiduciary duties. Consistent with New Jersey law, the Board appointed a special committee to review the allegations and demands in the derivative actions and demand letters. Following an investigation, the special committee determined that no action was warranted, and rejected the shareholders demands, communicating its determination to counsel for the shareholders. On January 10, 2023, one of the two shareholders referenced above filed a separate derivative action that: (i) is generally consistent with the shareholder letter and the two prior actions; and (ii) purports to challenge the reasonableness of the special committees process and determination. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and is vigorously defending itself in these matters.\nBeginning in February 2021, the Company received subpoenas from the Enforcement Division of the SEC requesting information from the Company relating to, among other things, AlarisTM infusion pumps. The Company is cooperating with the SEC and responding to these requests, including requests for employee interviews and depositions. The Company cannot anticipate the timing, scope, outcome or possible impact of the investigation, financial or otherwise.\nIn April 2019, the Department of Justice served the Company and CareFusion with CIDs seeking information regarding certain of CareFusions contracts with the Department of Veterans Affairs for certain products, including AlarisTM and PyxisTM devices, in connection with a civil investigation of possible violations of the False Claims Act, and the government later expanded the investigation to include several additional contracts. The government has made several requests for documents and interviews or depositions of Company personnel. The Company is cooperating with the government and responding to these requests.\nIn September 2021, the Company received a CID related to an inquiry initiated by the Northern District of Georgia in 2018 concerning sales and marketing practices with respect to certain aspects of the Companys urology business. After multiple document productions and interviews, the Company and the government mediated the case in an effort to resolve this dispute; such discussions are ongoing.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nIn April 2023, the Department of Justice served the Company with a CID seeking information regarding the Companys GenesisTM container products in connection with an investigation of possible violations of the False Claims Act. The government has requested documents and the Company is cooperating with the government and responding to its requests.\nIn September 2021, the Company was served with a complaint from the New Mexico Attorney General, alleging violations of the states consumer protection laws in connection with the sales and marketing of its IVC filters. The Companys motion to dismiss certain of the claims was granted on May 10, 2022 and discovery is proceeding as to the remaining claims. Trial is currently scheduled for June 2024. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and is vigorously defending itself in this matter. The Company cannot anticipate the timing, scope, outcome or possible impact at present.\nThe Company was sued in state and federal courts in Georgia by plaintiffs who work or reside near Company facilities in Covington, GA, where ethylene oxide (EtO) sterilization activities take place. The federal cases have been dismissed and refiled in state court. The plaintiffs in the cases seek compensatory and punitive damages. Pursuant to Georgia statute, punitive damages in these cases are generally capped at $250,000 per claimant. The cases allege a variety of injuries, including but not limited to multiple types of cancer, allegedly attributable to exposure to EtO. The Company does not believe these cases are appropriate for class action treatment and they have not been filed as such. The Company currently has approximately 230 of such suits involving approximately 340 plaintiffs asserting personal injury claims; approximately 45 of the cases also allege injury caused by exposure to a chemical of another defendant entirely unrelated to the Company. Three trial dates have been set in 2024. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and is vigorously defending itself in these matters.\nThe Company is also involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and is vigorously defending itself in each of these matters.\nExcept for the matters for which a potential disposition has been noted per above, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the other legal matters discussed above, nor can it predict whether any outcome will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations and/or consolidated cash flows. Accordingly, the Company has made no provisions for these legal matters in its consolidated results of operations.\nThe Company is a potentially responsible party to a number of federal administrative proceedings in the United States brought under the Comprehensive Environment Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as Superfund, and similar state laws. The Company also is subject to administrative proceedings under environmental laws in jurisdictions outside the U.S. The affected sites are in varying stages of development. In some instances, the remedy has been completed, while in others, environmental studies are underway or commencing. For several sites, there are other potentially responsible parties that may be jointly or severally liable to pay all or part of cleanup costs. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon the Companys experience, current information and applicable law, the Company does not expect these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations and/or consolidated cash flows.\nLitigation Accruals\nThe Company regularly monitors and evaluates the status of product liability and other litigated matters, and may, from time-to-time, engage in settlement discussions and mediation taking into consideration, among other things, developments in the litigation and the risks and uncertainties associated therewith. These activities have resulted in confidential settlements and going forward could result in further settlements, the terms of which would be confidential. A determination of the accrual amounts for these contingencies is made after analysis of each litigation matter. When appropriate, the accrual is developed with the consultation of outside\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\ncounsel and, in the case of certain mass tort litigation, actuarial specialists regarding the nature, timing, and extent of each matter.\nDuring fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company recorded pre-tax charges to Other operating (income) expense, net, of approximately $26 million, $21 million, and $361 million, respectively, related to certain of the product liability matters discussed above under the heading Product Liability Matters, including the related legal defense costs.\nThe Company considers relevant information when estimating its product liability accruals, including, but not limited to: the nature, number, and quality of unfiled and filed claims; the rate of claims being filed; the status of settlement discussions with plaintiffs counsel; the allegations and documentation supporting or refuting such allegations; publicly available information regarding similar medical device mass tort settlements; historical information regarding other product liability settlements involving the Company; and the stage of litigation. Because currently available information regarding product liability matters is often limited, there is inherent uncertainty and volatility relating to the Companys estimate of product liability. As additional information becomes available, the Company records adjustments to its product liability accruals as required.\nAccruals for the Company's product liability claims which are discussed above, as well as the related legal defense costs, amounted to approximately $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These accruals, which are generally long-term in nature, are largely recorded within Deferred Income Taxes and Other Liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in the Companys product liability accrual as of September 30, 2023, as compared with September 30, 2022, largely reflected the payment of settlements and legal fees during the fiscal year 2023, which reduced the amount of the accrual. The increase in the number of outstanding hernia repair device claims discussed above did not materially impact the Companys product liability accrual because the underlying estimate of the Companys liability includes and already accounts for unfiled claims. Moreover, the accrual reflects the determination that the quality of new hernia repair device claims has generally diminished over time. Claim activity during the fiscal year 2023 relating to the pelvic mesh device and IVC filter matters did not materially impact the Companys product liability accrual as of September 30, 2023.\nAdditionally, the particular outcome in any one product liability trial is typically not representative of potential outcomes of all cases or claims. Because the accrual already contemplates a wide range of possible outcomes, including those with a de minimis value, individual outcomes generally do not impact the value of other cases in the total case inventory or the overall product liability accrual.\nIn view of the uncertainties discussed above, the Company could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, liability insurance. In the opinion of management, any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and /or consolidated cash flows.\nNote 7 - Revenues\nThe Company sells a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products which are distributed through independent distribution channels and directly by BD through sales representatives. End-users of the Company's products include healthcare institutions, physicians, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, the pharmaceutical industry and the general public.\nTiming of Revenue Recognition\nThe Company's revenues are primarily recognized when the customer obtains control of the product sold, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms specified in the sales agreement. Revenues associated with certain instruments and equipment for which installation is complex, and therefore significantly affects the customers ability to use and benefit from the product, are recognized when customer acceptance of these installed products has been confirmed. For certain service arrangements, including extended warranty and software maintenance contracts, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. The\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nmajority of revenues relating to extended warranty contracts associated with certain instruments and equipment is generally recognized within a few years whereas deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts is generally recognized over a longer period.\nMeasurement of Revenues\nThe Company acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and as such, generally records revenues on a gross basis. Revenues exclude any taxes that the Company collects from customers and remits to tax authorities. The Company considers its shipping and handling costs to be costs of contract fulfillment and has made the accounting policy election to record these costs within Selling and administrative expense.\nPayment terms extended to the Company's customers are based upon commercially reasonable terms for the markets in which the Company's products are sold. Because the Company generally expects to receive payment within one year or less from when control of a product is transferred to the customer, the Company does not generally adjust its revenues for the effects of a financing component. The Companys allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of its trade receivables. Such estimated credit losses are determined based on historical loss experiences, customer-specific credit risk, and reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, such as country or regional risks that are not captured in the historical loss information. Amounts are written off against the allowances for doubtful accounts when the Company determines that a customer account is uncollectable. The allowance for doubtful accounts for trade receivables is not material to the Company's consolidated financial results.\nThe Company's gross revenues are subject to a variety of deductions which are recorded in the same period that the underlying revenues are recognized. Such variable consideration includes rebates, sales discounts and sales returns. Because these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations, judgment is required when determining the impact of these revenue deductions on gross revenues for a reporting period. Rebates provided by the Company are based upon prices determined under the Company's agreements with its end-user customers. Additional factors considered in the estimate of the Company's rebate liability include the quantification of inventory that is either in stock at or in transit to the Company's distributors, as well as the estimated lag time between the sale of product and the payment of corresponding rebates. The Companys rebate liability at September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $538 million and $525 million, respectively. The impact of other forms of variable consideration, including sales discounts and sales returns, is not material to the Company's revenues. Additional disclosures relating to sales discounts and sales returns are provided in Note 19.\nThe Company's agreements with customers within certain organizational units including Medication Management Solutions, Integrated Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences, contain multiple performance obligations including both products and certain services noted above. The transaction price for these agreements is allocated to each performance obligation based upon its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling price is the amount at which the Company would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. The Company generally estimates standalone selling prices using its list prices and a consideration of typical discounts offered to customers.\nEffects of Revenue Arrangements on Consolidated Balance Sheets\nDue to the nature of the majority of the Company's products and services, the Company typically does not incur costs to fulfill a contract in advance of providing the customer with goods or services. Capitalized contract costs associated with the costs to fulfill contracts for certain products in the Medication Management Solutions organizational unit are immaterial to the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company's costs to obtain contracts are comprised of sales commissions which are paid to the Company's employees or third party agents. The majority of the sales commissions incurred by the Company relate to revenue that is recognized over a period that is less than one year and as such, the Company has elected a practical expedient provided under ASC 606 to record the majority of its expense associated with sales commissions as it is incurred. Commissions\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nrelating to revenues recognized over a period longer than one year are recorded as assets which are amortized over the period over which the revenues underlying the commissions are recognized. Capitalized contract costs related to such commissions are immaterial to the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company records contract liabilities for unearned revenue that is allocated to performance obligations such as extended warranty and software maintenance contracts, which are performed over time as discussed further above. Accrued expenses on the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2023, included approximately $412 million of contract liabilities. Contract liabilities as of September 30, 2022, were immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial results. The Company's liability for product warranties provided under its agreements with customers is not material to its consolidated balance sheets.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe Company's obligations relative to service contracts, which are further discussed above, and pending installations of equipment, primarily in the Company's Medication Management Solutions unit, represent unsatisfied performance obligations of the Company. The revenues under existing contracts with original expected durations of more than one year, which are attributable to products and/or services that have not yet been installed or provided, are estimated to be approximately $2.3 billion at September 30, 2023. The Company expects to recognize the majority of this revenue over the next three years.\nWithin the Company's Medication Management Solutions, Medication Delivery Solutions, Integrated Diagnostic Solutions, and Biosciences units, some contracts also contain minimum purchase commitments of reagents or other consumables and the future sales of these consumables represent additional unsatisfied performance obligations of the Company. The revenue attributable to the unsatisfied minimum purchase commitment-related performance obligations, for contracts with original expected durations of more than one year, is estimated to be approximately $2.0 billion at September 30, 2023. This revenue will be recognized over the customer relationship periods.\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nA disaggregation of the Company's revenues by segment, organizational unit and geographic region is provided in Note 8.\nNote 8 - Segment Data\nThe Company's organizational structure is based upon three worldwide business segments: BD Medical (Medical), BD Life Sciences (Life Sciences) and BD Interventional (\"Interventional\"). The Companys segments are strategic businesses that are managed separately because each one develops, manufactures and markets distinct products and services.\nMedical\nMedical produces a broad array of medical technologies and devices that are used to help improve healthcare delivery in a wide range of settings. The primary customers served by Medical are hospitals and clinics; physicians office practices; consumers and retail pharmacies; governmental and nonprofit public health agencies; pharmaceutical companies; and healthcare workers. Medical consists of the following organizational units: Medication Delivery Solutions; Medication Management Solutions; Pharmaceutical Systems.\nLife Sciences\nLife Sciences provides products for the safe collection and transport of diagnostics specimens, and instruments and reagent systems to detect a broad range of infectious diseases, healthcare-associated infections and cancers. In addition, Life Sciences produces research and clinical tools that facilitate the study of cells, and the components of cells, to gain a better understanding of normal and disease processes. That information is used to aid the discovery and development of new drugs and vaccines, and to improve the diagnosis and management of diseases. The primary customers served by Life Sciences are hospitals, laboratories and clinics;\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nblood banks; healthcare workers; physicians office practices; retail pharmacies; academic and government institutions; and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Life Sciences consists of the following organizational units: Integrated Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences.\nInterventional\nInterventional provides vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialty products that are intended to be used once and then discarded or are either temporarily or permanently implanted. The primary customers served by Interventional are hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, individual healthcare professionals, extended care facilities, alternate site facilities, and patients via the segment's Homecare business. Interventional consists of the following organizational units: Surgery; Peripheral Intervention; Urology and Critical Care.\nAdditional Segment Information\nDistribution of products is primarily through independent distribution channels, and directly to end-users by BD and independent sales representatives. No customer accounted for 10% or more of revenues in any of the three years presented.\nSegment disclosures are on a performance basis consistent with internal management reporting. The Company evaluates performance of its business segments and allocates resources to them primarily based upon operating income, which represents revenues reduced by product costs and operating expenses. The Companys chief operating decision maker does not receive any asset information by business segment and, as such, the Company does not report asset information by business segment.\nThe tables below reflect the Companys revenues and operating income from continuing operations. Revenues and operating income from the former Diabetes Care business prior to its spin-off on April 1, 2022 are included in (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax. See Note 2 for further information.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nFinancial information for the Companys segments is detailed below.

The amount in 2023 includes a pre-tax gain recognized on the Company's sale of its Surgical Instrumentation platform of approximately $268 million, which is further discussed in Note 2. The amount in 2021 includes a pre-tax charge recorded to Other operating (income) expense, net, related to certain product liability matters of $361 million, as further discussed in Note 6.\nGeographic Information\nThe countries in which the Company has local revenue-generating operations have been combined into the following geographic areas: the United States (including Puerto Rico); EMEA (which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa); Greater Asia (which includes countries in Greater China, Japan, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Korea, and Australia and New Zealand); and Other, which is comprised of Latin America (which includes Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America) and Canada.\nRevenues to unaffiliated customers are generally based upon the source of the product shipment. Long-lived assets, which include net property, plant and equipment, are based upon physical location.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nThe table below shows revenues from continuing operations and long-lived assets of continuing operations by geographic area:\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2021\nRevenues\nUnited States $ 11,113 $ 10,722 $ 10,371\nEMEA 4,244 4,043 4,548\nGreater Asia 2,913 3,047 3,069\nOther 1,102 1,058 1,142\n$ 19,372 $ 18,870 $ 19,131\nLong-Lived Assets\nUnited States $ 35,732 $ 36,617 $ 35,896\nEMEA 5,317 5,126 5,778\nGreater Asia 1,521 1,528 1,607\nOther 1,116 1,079 860\nCorporate 418 442 465\n$ 44,104 $ 44,792 $ 44,606\nNote 9 - Share-Based Compensation\nThe Company grants share-based awards under the 2004 Employee and Director Equity-Based Compensation Plan (\"2004 Plan\"), which provides long-term incentive compensation to employees and directors consisting of: stock appreciation rights (\"SARs\"), performance-based restricted stock units, time-vested restricted stock units and other stock awards.\nThe fair value of share-based payments is recognized as compensation expense in net income. BD estimates forfeitures based on experience at the time of grant and adjusts expense to reflect actual forfeitures. The amounts and location of compensation cost relating to share-based payments included in the consolidated statements of income is as follows:\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2021\nCost of products sold $ 50 $ 46 $ 43\nSelling and administrative expense 170 156 158\nResearch and development expense 41 37 36\nAcquisition-related integration and restructuring expense - 1 1\nTotal share-based compensation cost $ 261 $ 240 $ 238\nTax benefit associated with share-based compensation costs recognized $ 58 $ 55 $ 55\nTotal share-based compensation expense includes pre-tax compensation expense included in Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax that was not material in 2022 and 2021.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nStock Appreciation Rights\nSARs represent the right to receive, upon exercise, shares of common stock having a value equal to the difference between the market price of common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price on the date of grant. SARs generally vest over a period of four years and have a term of ten years. The fair value of awards was estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-based binomial option valuation model and these valuations were largely based upon the following weighted-average assumptions:\n2023 2022 2021\nRisk-free interest rate 3.78% 1.41% 0.68%\nExpected volatility 21.0% 22.0% 23.0%\nExpected dividend yield 1.53% 1.42% 1.46%\nExpected life 7.0 years 7.3 years 7.4 years\nFair value derived $57.80 $49.45 $44.38\nExpected volatility is based upon historical volatility for the Companys common stock and other factors. The expected life of SARs granted is derived from the output of the lattice-based model, using assumed exercise rates based on historical exercise and termination patterns, and represents the period of time that SARs granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate used is based upon the published U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar life. The dividend yield is based upon the most recently declared quarterly dividend as of the grant date. The Company issued 0.5 million shares during 2023 to satisfy the SARs exercised.\nA summary of SARs outstanding as of September 30, 2023 and changes during the year then ended is as follows:\nSARs (in\nthousands) Weighted\nAverage\nExercise Price Weighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual Term\n(Years) Aggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\n(Millions\nof dollars)\nBalance at October 1 5,544 $ 197.31\nGranted 752 238.06\nExercised (1,161) 156.11\nForfeited, canceled or expired (230) 253.21\nBalance at September 30 4,905 $ 211.47 5.66 $ 231\nVested and expected to vest at September 30 4,757 210.67 5.58 $ 228\nExercisable at September 30 3,428 $ 200.41 4.53 $ 199\nA summary of SARs exercised during 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2021\nTotal intrinsic value of SARs exercised $ 126 $ 184 $ 102\nTotal fair value of SARs vested $ 34 $ 36 $ 39\nPerformance-Based and Time-Vested Restricted Stock Units\nPerformance-based restricted stock units cliff vest three years after the date of grant. These units are tied to the Companys performance against pre-established targets over a performance period of three years. The performance measures for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 were average annual currency-neutral revenue growth and average annual return on invested capital, with the combined factor subject to adjustment based on the Company's relative total shareholder return (measures the Companys stock performance during the performance period against that of peer companies). Under the Companys long-term incentive program, the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nactual payout under these awards may vary from zero to 200% of an employees target payout, based on the Companys actual performance over the performance period of three years. In fiscal year 2021, the Company also issued additional performance-based time-vested units to certain key executives, which cliff vest three years after the date of grant and are tied to the Companys performance against average annual growth in the Companys Adjusted EPS over a performance period of three years. No shares will be issuable if the performance targets have not been met. The fair value is based on the market price of the Companys stock on the date of grant. Compensation cost initially recognized assumes that the target payout level will be achieved and is adjusted for subsequent changes in the expected outcome of performance-related conditions. For units for which the performance conditions are modified after the date of grant, any incremental increase in the fair value of the modified units, over the original units, is recorded as compensation expense on the date of the modification for vested units, or over the remaining performance period for units not yet vested.\nTime-vested restricted stock unit awards vest on a graded basis over a period of three years, except for certain key executives of the Company, including the executive officers, for which such units generally vest one year following the employees retirement. The related share-based compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period or is based on retirement eligibility. The fair value of all time-vested restricted stock units is based on the market value of the Companys stock on the date of grant.\nA summary of restricted stock units outstanding as of September 30, 2023 and changes during the year then ended is as follows:\nPerformance-Based Time-Vested\nStock Units (in\nthousands) Weighted\nAverage Grant\nDate Fair Value Stock Units (in\nthousands) Weighted\nAverage Grant\nDate Fair Value\nBalance at October 1 934 $ 230.46 1,561 $ 224.87\nGranted 440 227.11 1,037 231.58\nDistributed (81) 238.60 (510) 232.11\nForfeited or canceled (330) 235.53 (372) 231.72\nBalance at September 30 963 (a) $ 226.51 1,716 $ 225.33\nExpected to vest at September 30 597 (b) $ 225.74 1,626 $ 224.89\n(a)Based on 200% of target payout for performance based restricted units and 100% of the performance based time-vested units.\n(b)Net of expected forfeited units and units in excess of the expected performance payout of 69 thousand and 297 thousand shares, respectively.\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted during the years 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nPerformance-Based Time-Vested\n2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021\nWeighted average grant date fair value of units granted $ 227.11 $ 242.39 $ 216.39 $ 231.58 $ 239.39 $ 223.60\nThe total fair value of stock units vested during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:\nPerformance-Based Time-Vested\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021\nTotal fair value of units vested $ 28 $ 14 $ 16 $ 169 $ 169 $ 203\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nAt September 30, 2023, the weighted average remaining vesting term of performance-based and time vested restricted stock units is 1.27 and 0.71 years, respectively.\nUnrecognized Compensation Expense and Other Stock Plans\nThe amount of unrecognized compensation expense for all non-vested share-based awards as of September 30, 2023, is approximately $272 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining life of approximately 1.9 years. At September 30, 2023, 5.6 million shares were authorized for future grants under the 2004 Plan. The Company has a policy of satisfying share-based payments through either open market purchases or shares held in treasury. At September 30, 2023, the Company has sufficient shares held in treasury to satisfy these payments.\nAs of September 30, 2023, 98 thousand shares were held in trust relative to a Director's Deferral plan, which provides a means to defer director compensation, from time to time, on a deferred stock or cash basis. Also as of September 30, 2023, 211 thousand shares were issuable under a Deferred Compensation Plan that allows certain highly-compensated employees, including executive officers, to defer salary, annual incentive awards and certain equity-based compensation.\nNote 10 - Benefit Plans\nThe Company has defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees in the United States and in certain international locations. Postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits provided to qualifying domestic retirees as well as other postretirement benefit plans in international countries are not material. The measurement date used for the Companys employee benefit plans is September 30.\nIn August 2023, the Company announced that effective September 30, 2024, it would freeze the U.S. Plan, and plan participants, which include legacy Bard U.S. pension plan participants as further discussed below, no longer will accrue benefits under the plan subsequent to this date. Both the legacy BD U.S. pension and legacy Bard U.S. pension plans had already been frozen to prevent new participants effective January 1, 2018 and January 1, 2011, respectively.\nIn fiscal year 2022, the transfer of employees to Embecta in connection with the spin-off triggered remeasurements of some of the Companys benefit plans. The BD U.S. pension plan was also remeasured upon the merging of this plan with the legacy Bard U.S. pension plan effective January 1, 2022. These remeasurements did not materially impact the Companys benefit obligation and resulted in adjustments to Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nGenerally, all components of the Companys net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, aside from service cost, are recorded to Other expense, net on its consolidated statements of income. Certain amounts for termination benefits, curtailments and settlements related to the spin-off of Embecta, were recorded in Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax and were not material.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nNet pension cost for the years ended September 30 included the following components:\nPension Plans\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2021\nService cost $ 91 $ 134 $ 150\nInterest cost 129 77 71\nExpected return on plan assets (141) (187) (174)\nAmortization of prior service credit (7) (15) (16)\nAmortization of loss 58 61 97\nCurtailments/settlement loss 44 73 9\nNet pension cost $ 174 $ 143 $ 137\nNet pension cost included in the preceding table that is attributable to international plans $ 25 $ 20 $ 41\nThe amounts provided above for amortization of prior service credit and amortization of loss represent the reclassifications of prior service credits and net actuarial losses that were recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in prior periods. The Company recognizes pension settlements when payments from the plan exceed the sum of service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost associated with the plan for the fiscal year. The settlement losses recorded in 2023 and 2022 included lump sum benefit payments primarily associated with the Companys U.S. pension plan. A curtailment gain was recognized in 2023 related the freeze of the U.S. pension plan and a curtailment loss was recognized in 2021 related to a freeze of a pension plan in Europe.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nThe change in benefit obligation, change in fair value of pension plan assets, funded status and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for these plans were as follows:\nPension Plans\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022\nChange in benefit obligation:\nBeginning obligation $ 2,634 $ 3,889\nService cost 91 134\nInterest cost 129 77\nPlan amendments - 1\nBenefits paid (67) (64)\nImpact of Embecta spin-off - (7)\nActuarial gain (24) (1,007)\nCurtailments/settlements (214) (246)\nOther, includes translation 68 (143)\nBenefit obligation at September 30 $ 2,617 $ 2,634\nChange in fair value of plan assets:\nBeginning fair value $ 2,242 $ 3,222\nActual return on plan assets 33 (740)\nEmployer contribution 62 198\nBenefits paid (67) (64)\nImpact of Embecta spin-off - (6)\nSettlements (200) (241)\nOther, includes translation 59 (127)\nPlan assets at September 30 $ 2,129 $ 2,242\nFunded Status at September 30:\nUnfunded benefit obligation $ (488) $ (392)\nAmounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets at September 30:\nOther Assets $ 81 $ 70\nSalaries, wages and related items (15) (15)\nLong-term Employee Benefit Obligations (554) (447)\nNet amount recognized $ (488) $ (392)\nAmounts recognized in Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) before income taxes at September 30:\nPrior service credit $ 3 $ 24\nNet actuarial loss (689) (728)\nNet amount recognized $ (686) $ (704)\nInternational pension plan assets at fair value included in the preceding table were $748 million and $705 million at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The international pension plan projected benefit obligations were $833 million and $772 million at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nThe benefit obligation associated with postretirement healthcare and life insurance plans provided to qualifying domestic retirees, which was largely recorded to Long-Term Employee Benefit Obligations, was $92 million and $101 million at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nPension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets and plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets consist of the following at September 30:\nAccumulated Benefit\nObligation Exceeds the\nFair Value of Plan Assets Projected Benefit\nObligation Exceeds the\nFair Value of Plan Assets\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2023 2022\nProjected benefit obligation $ 2,140 $ 2,104 $ 2,159 $ 2,182\nAccumulated benefit obligation $ 2,088 $ 2,059\nFair value of plan assets $ 1,575 $ 1,644 $ 1,591 $ 1,720\nThe weighted average assumptions used in determining pension plan information were as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\nNet Cost\nDiscount rate:\nU.S. plans (a) 5.62 % 2.89 % 2.80 %\nInternational plans 4.26 1.75 1.44\nExpected return on plan assets:\nU.S. plans 7.25 6.25 6.25\nInternational plans 5.02 4.84 4.92\nRate of compensation increase:\nU.S. plans 4.51 4.31 4.30\nInternational plans 2.86 2.63 2.20\nCash balance plan interest crediting rate:\nU.S. plans 4.00 4.00 4.00\nInternational plans 1.98 2.02 1.95\nBenefit Obligation\nDiscount rate:\nU.S. plans 6.01 5.62 2.89\nInternational plans 4.62 4.26 1.75\nRate of compensation increase:\nU.S. plans 4.00 4.51 4.31\nInternational plans 2.86 2.86 2.63\nCash balance plan interest crediting rate:\nU.S. plans 4.00 4.00 4.00\nInternational plans 2.21 1.98 2.02\n(a)The Company calculated the service and interest components utilizing an approach that discounts the individual expected cash flows using the applicable spot rates derived from the yield curve over the projected cash flow period.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nExpected Rate of Return on Plan Assets\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets is based upon expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios. In establishing this assumption, the Company considers many factors, including historical assumptions compared with actual results; benchmark data; expected returns on various plan asset classes, as well as current and expected asset allocations.\nExpected Funding\nThe Companys funding policy for its defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that may be appropriate considering the funded status of the plans, tax consequences, the cash flow generated by the Company and other factors. The Company made a discretionary contribution to its BD U.S. pension plan of $150 million in October 2023. The Company did not make any required contributions in 2023 and does not anticipate any significant required contributions to its pension plans in fiscal year 2024.\nExpected benefit payments are as follows:\n(Millions of dollars) Pension\nPlans\n2024 $ 208\n2025 203\n2026 214\n2027 204\n2028 208\n2029-2033 1,061\nExpected benefit payments associated with postretirement healthcare plans are immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial results.\nInvestments\nThe Companys primary objective is to achieve returns sufficient to meet future benefit obligations. It seeks to generate above market returns by investing in more volatile asset classes such as equities while at the same time controlling risk through diversification in non-correlated asset classes and through allocations to more stable asset classes like fixed income.\nU.S. Plans\nThe Companys U.S. pension plans comprise 65% of total benefit plan investments, based on September 30, 2023 market values, and have a target asset mix of 45% fixed income, 21% diversifying investments and 34% equities. This mix was established based on an analysis of projected benefit payments and estimates of long-term returns, volatilities and correlations for various asset classes. The asset allocations to diversifying investments include high-yield bonds, hedge funds, real estate, infrastructure, leveraged loans and emerging markets bonds.\nThe actual portfolio investment mix may, from time to time, deviate from the established target mix due to various factors such as normal market fluctuations, the reliance on estimates in connection with the determination of allocations and normal portfolio activity such as additions and withdrawals. Rebalancing of the asset portfolio on a quarterly basis is required to address any allocations that deviate from the established target allocations in excess of defined allowable ranges. The target allocations are subject to periodic review, including a review of the asset portfolios performance, by the named fiduciary of the plans. Any tactical deviations from the established asset mix require the approval of the named fiduciary.\nThe U.S. plans may enter into both exchange traded and non-exchange traded derivative transactions in order to manage interest rate exposure, volatility, term structure of interest rates, and sector and currency\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nexposures within the fixed income portfolios. The Company has established minimum credit quality standards for counterparties in such transactions.\nThe following table provides the fair value measurements of U.S. plan assets, as well as the measurement techniques and inputs utilized to measure fair value of these assets, at September 30, 2023 and 2022. The categorization of fund investments is based upon the categorization of these funds underlying assets.\nBasis of fair value measurement (See Note 1)\n(Millions of dollars) Total U.S.\nPlan Asset\nBalances Investments Measured at Net Asset Value (a) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\n2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022\nFixed Income:\nCorporate bonds $ 443 $ 492 $ - $ - $ 260 $ 258 $ 182 $ 234 $ - $ -\nGovernment and agency-U.S. 53 69 - - 43 53 10 16 - -\nGovernment and agency-Foreign 17 22 - - - - 17 22 - -\nOther fixed income 46 52 - - 24 26 22 26 - -\nEquity securities 469 469 59 62 410 406 - - - -\nCash and cash equivalents 202 243 - - 202 243 - - - -\nOther 151 191 79 110 72 81 - - - -\nFair value of plan assets $ 1,382 $ 1,537 $ 138 $ 172 $ 1,012 $ 1,068 $ 231 $ 297 $ - $ -\n(a)As per applicable disclosure requirements, certain investments that were measured at net asset value per share or its equivalent have not been categorized within the fair value hierarchy. Values of such assets are based on the corroborated net asset value provided by the fund administrator.\nFixed Income Securities\nU.S. pension plan assets categorized above as fixed income securities include fund investments comprised of corporate and government and agency investments. Investments in corporate bonds are diversified across industry and sector and consist of investment-grade, as well as high-yield debt instruments. U.S. government investments consist of obligations of the U.S. Treasury, other U.S. government agencies, state governments and local municipalities. Assets categorized as foreign government and agency debt securities included investments in developed and emerging markets.\nThe values of fixed income investments classified within Level 1 are based on the closing price reported on the major market on which the investments are traded. A portion of the fixed income instruments classified within Level 2 are valued based upon estimated prices from independent vendors pricing models and these prices are derived from market observable sources including: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other market-related data.\nEquity Securities\nU.S. pension plan assets categorized as equity securities consist of fund investments in publicly-traded U.S. and non-U.S. equity securities. In order to achieve appropriate diversification, these portfolios are invested across market sectors, investment styles, capitalization weights and geographic regions. The values of equity securities classified within Level 1 are based on the closing price reported on the major market on which the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\ninvestments are traded or have a readily determinable fair value based on published prices obtained from fund managers which represent the price at which the instruments can be redeemed at period end. The U.S. pension plan has no future funding commitments associated with these investments and has the right to redeem them upon one days notice, at any time and without restriction.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nA portion of the U.S. plans assets consists of investments in cash and cash equivalents, primarily to accommodate liquidity requirements relating to trade settlement and benefit payment activity, and the values of these assets are based upon quoted market prices.\nOther Securities\nOther U.S. pension plan assets include fund investments comprised of hedge funds. The values of such instruments classified within Level 1 are based on the closing price reported on the major market on which the investments are traded.\nInternational Plans\nInternational plan assets comprise 35% of the Companys total benefit plan assets, based on market value at September 30, 2023. Such plans have local independent fiduciary committees, with responsibility for development and oversight of investment policy, including asset allocation decisions. In making such decisions, consideration is given to local regulations, investment practices and funding rules.\nThe following table provides the fair value measurements of international plan assets, as well as the measurement techniques and inputs utilized to measure fair value of these assets, at September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nBasis of fair value measurement (See Note 1)\n(Millions of dollars) Total International\nPlan Asset\nBalances Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (a)\n2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022\nFixed Income:\nCorporate bonds $ 122 $ 33 $ 100 $ 19 $ 10 $ 14 $ 12 $ -\nGovernment and agency-U.S. 9 10 8 8 2 2 - -\nGovernment and agency-Foreign 197 180 165 167 26 13 6 -\nOther fixed income 43 76 34 68 9 8 - -\nEquity securities 173 190 147 190 1 - 25 -\nCash and cash equivalents 10 7 8 7 - - 2 -\nReal estate 36 35 1 1 26 24 9 10\nInsurance contracts 103 96 - - - - 103 96\nOther 55 76 35 48 1 7 19 21\nFair value of plan assets $ 748 $ 705 $ 499 $ 508 $ 74 $ 68 $ 175 $ 128\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\n(a)Changes in the fair value of international pension assets measured using Level 3 inputs for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were immaterial.\nFixed Income Securities\nFixed income investments held by international pension plans include corporate, U.S. government and non-U.S. government securities. The values of fixed income securities classified within Level 1 are based on the closing price reported on the major market on which the investments are traded. Values of investments classified within Level 2 are based upon estimated prices from independent vendors pricing models and these prices are derived from market observable sources.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities included in the international plan assets consist of publicly-traded U.S. and non-U.S. equity securities. The values of equity securities classified within Level 1 are based on the closing price reported on the major market on which the investments are traded or have a readily determinable fair value based on published prices obtained from fund managers which represent the price at which the instruments can be redeemed at period end. The international plans holding these securities have no future funding commitments associated with these investments and has the right to redeem them upon one days notice, at any time and without restriction.\nOther Securities\nThe international plans hold a portion of assets in cash and cash equivalents, in order to accommodate liquidity requirements and the values are based upon quoted market prices. Real estate investments consist of investments in funds holding an interest in real properties and the corresponding values represent the estimated fair value based on the fair value of the underlying investment value or cost, adjusted for any accumulated earnings or losses. The values of insurance contracts approximately represent cash surrender value. Other investments include fund investments for which values are based upon either quoted market prices or market observable sources.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe cost of voluntary defined contribution plans which provide for a Company match or contribution was $156 million in 2023, $178 million in 2022 and $153 million in 2021.\nNote 11 - Acquisitions\nOn July 18, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Parata Systems (Parata), an innovative provider of pharmacy automation solutions, for total cash consideration of $1.548 billion. Since the acquisition date, financial results for Parata's product offerings are being reported within results for the Medical segments Medication Management Solutions unit. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.\nThe fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed resulted in the recognition of developed technology intangible assets of $628 million, customer relationships intangible asset of $161 million, and $1 million of other net liabilities. The excess of the purchase price over fair value of the acquired net assets was recorded as goodwill of $759 million, which related to synergies expected to be gained from leveraging the existing presence of the Companys sales and marketing teams in pharmacies and acute care facilities, the broader coverage of the Companys legacy sales and marketing teams, and revenue and cash flow projections associated with future technologies. A portion of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.\nIn addition to the Parata acquisition discussed above, the Company completed various other acquisitions during fiscal year 2022 which were not material individually or in the aggregate, including Parata.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nNote 12 - Business Restructuring Charges\nThe Company incurred restructuring costs, primarily in connection with the Company's simplification and other cost saving initiatives that are part of its strategic objectives, which were largely recorded within Acquisition-related integration and restructuring expense on its consolidated statements of income. These simplification and other costs saving initiatives are focused on reducing complexity, enhancing product quality, refining customer experience, and improving cost efficiency across all of the Companys segments. Restructuring liability activity in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:\n(Millions of dollars) Employee Termination Other (a) Total\nBalance at September 30, 2020 $ 32 $ 4 $ 36\nCharged to expense 14 30 44\nCash payments (31) (25) (56)\nNon-cash settlements - (4) (4)\nBalance at September 30, 2021 $ 14 $ 5 $ 19\nCharged to expense 21 103 123\nCash payments (11) (71) (82)\nNon-cash settlements - (25) (25)\nOther adjustments - (1) (1)\nBalance at September 30, 2022 $ 24 $ 11 $ 35\nCharged to expense 117 122 239\nCash payments (62) (103) (165)\nNon-cash settlements - (30) (30)\nOther adjustments - 1 1\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ 79 $ 1 $ 80\n(a)Expenses primarily relate to other costs associated with the execution of the Companys cost efficiency and restructuring programs, such as incremental project management costs and asset write-offs.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nNote 13 - Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets at September 30 consisted of:\n2023 2022\n(Millions of dollars) Gross\nCarrying\nAmount Accumulated\nAmortization Net Carrying Amount Gross\nCarrying\nAmount Accumulated\nAmortization Net Carrying Amount\nAmortized intangible assets\nDeveloped technology $ 15,080 $ (7,023) $ 8,058 $ 15,087 $ (5,979) $ 9,108\nCustomer relationships 4,859 (2,521) 2,338 4,853 (2,170) 2,683\nPatents, trademarks and other 1,130 (624) 505 1,046 (574) 473\nAmortized intangible assets $ 21,069 $ (10,168) $ 10,901 $ 20,987 $ (8,723) $ 12,264\nUnamortized intangible assets\nAcquired in-process research and development $ 44 $ 44\nTrademarks 2 2\nUnamortized intangible assets $ 46 $ 46\nIntangible amortization expense was $1.465 billion, $1.430 billion and $1.402 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The estimated aggregate amortization expense for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2024 to 2028 are as follows: 2024 - $1.434 billion; 2025 - $1.431 billion; 2026 - $1.398 billion; 2027 - $1.327 billion; 2028 - $1.239 billion.\nThe following is a reconciliation of goodwill by business segment:\n(Millions of dollars) Medical Life Sciences Interventional Total\nGoodwill as of September 30, 2021 $ 10,240 $ 836 $ 12,810 $ 23,886\nAcquisitions (a) 814 71 188 1,073\nPurchase price allocation adjustments 1 - (2) (1)\nCurrency translation (145) (20) (171) (337)\nGoodwill as of September 30, 2022 $ 10,909 $ 888 $ 12,824 $ 24,621\nDivestitures and related adjustments (b) - - (218) (218)\nPurchase price allocation adjustments (c) 13 - - 13\nCurrency translation 33 9 64 105\nGoodwill as of September 30, 2023 $ 10,955 $ 897 $ 12,670 $ 24,522\n(a)Primarily represents goodwill recognized in the Medical segment upon the Company's acquisition of Parata, which is further discussed in Note 11. Also includes goodwill recognized relative to certain acquisitions which were not material individually or in the aggregate.\n(b)Represents goodwill derecognized upon the Companys sale of its Surgical Instrumentation platform, as further discussed in Note 2.\n(c)The purchase price allocation adjustments were primarily driven by an adjustment to tax-related balances recorded upon the finalization of the Parata acquisition allocation within one year of the transaction's closing.\nNote 14 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate certain exposures. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The effects these derivative instruments and\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nhedged items had on the Companys balance sheets and the fair values of the derivatives outstanding at September 30, 2023 and 2022 were not material. The effects on the Companys financial performance and cash flows are provided below.\nForeign Currency Risks and Related Strategies\nThe Company has foreign currency exposures throughout Europe, Greater Asia, Canada and Latin America. Transactional currency exposures that arise from entering into transactions, generally on an intercompany basis, in non-hyperinflationary countries that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are mitigated primarily through the use of forward contracts. In order to mitigate foreign currency exposure relating to its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, the Company has hedged the currency risk associated with those investments with certain instruments such as foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps, which are designated as net investment hedges, as well as currency exchange contracts.\nThe notional amounts of the Companys foreign currency-related derivative instruments as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n(Millions of dollars) Hedge Designation 2023 2022\nForeign exchange contracts (a) Undesignated $ 3,146 $ 2,766\nForeign currency-denominated debt (b) Net investment hedges 1,056 2,140\nCross-currency swaps (c) Net investment hedges 2,119 910\n(a)Represent hedges of transactional foreign exchange exposures resulting primarily from intercompany payables and receivables. Gains and losses on these instruments are recognized immediately in income. These gains and losses are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying hedged items, as well as the hedging costs associated with the derivative instruments. Net amounts recognized in Other expense, net, during the years ending September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are detailed in Note 19.\n(b)Represents foreign currency-denominated long-term notes outstanding which were effective as economic hedges of net investments in certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.\n(c)Represents cross-currency swaps which were effective as economic hedges of net investments in certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.\nNet gains or losses relating to the net investment hedges, which are attributable to changes in the foreign currencies to U.S. dollar spot exchange rates, are recorded as accumulated foreign currency translation in Other comprehensive income (loss). Upon the termination of a net investment hedge, any net gain or loss included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) relative to the investment hedge remains until the foreign subsidiary investment is disposed of or is substantially liquidated.\nNet (losses) gains recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) relating to the Company's net investment hedges as of September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2021\nForeign currency-denominated debt $ (155) $ 320 $ 32\nCross-currency swaps (a) (70) 173 (21)\n(a)The amounts in 2023, 2022 and 2021 include net of tax gains (losses) recognized on terminated cross-currency swaps of $13 million, $46 million and $(35) million, respectively.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nInterest Rate Risks and Related Strategies\nThe Company uses a mix of fixed and variable rate debt, which is further discussed in Note 16, to manage its interest rate exposure, and periodically uses interest rate swaps to manage such exposures. Under these interest rate swaps, the Company exchanges, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. These swaps are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges.\nChanges in the fair value of the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk) are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss). If interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are terminated, the balance in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) attributable to those derivatives is reclassified into earnings, within Interest expense, over the remaining life of the hedged debt. The amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income relating to cash flow hedges during 2023, 2022 and 2021, as well as the amounts expected to be reclassified within the next 12 months, are not material to the Company's consolidated financial results.\nThe Company recorded net after-tax gains of $23 million, $92 million and $72 million in Other comprehensive income (loss) relating to interest rate-related cash flow hedges during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The gains recorded during fiscal year 2022 included a net after-tax gain of $41 million that was realized upon the Companys termination of $500 million of forward starting interest rate swaps.\nFor interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges (i.e., hedges against the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk), changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps offset changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to changes in market interest rates. Amounts recorded during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial results.\nThe notional amounts of the Companys interest rate-related derivative instruments as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n(Millions of dollars) Hedge Designation 2023 2022\nInterest rate swaps (a) Fair value hedges $ 700 $ 700\nForward starting interest rate swaps (b) Cash flow hedges 500 500\n(a)Represents fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements the Company entered into to convert the interest payments on certain long-term notes from the fixed rate to a floating interest rate based on secured overnight financing rates (\"SOFR\"), which replaced LIBOR rates in fiscal year 2023.\n(b)Represents interest rate derivatives entered into to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk related to future debt issuances.\nOther Risk Exposures\nThe Company purchases resins, which are oil-based components used in the manufacture of certain products. Significant increases in world oil prices that lead to increases in resin purchase costs could impact future operating results. From time to time, the Company has managed price risks associated with these commodity purchases through commodity derivative forward contracts. The Companys commodity derivative forward contracts at September 30, 2023 and 2022 were immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial results.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nNote 15 - Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\nThe following reconciles cash and equivalents and restricted cash reported within the Company's consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2023 and 2022 to the total of these amounts shown on the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows:\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022\nCash and equivalents $ 1,416 $ 1,006\nRestricted cash 65 153\nCash and equivalents and restricted cash $ 1,481 $ 1,159\nThe fair values of the Companys financial instruments are as follows:\n(Millions of dollars) Basis of fair value measurement (See Note 1) 2023 2022\nInstitutional money market accounts (a) Level 1 $ 373 $ 1\nCurrent portion of long-term debt (b) Level 2 1,122 1,927\nLong-term debt (b) Level 2 12,850 12,119\n(a)These financial instruments are recorded within Cash and equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. The institutional money market accounts permit daily redemption.\n(b)Long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost. The fair value of long-term debt is measured based upon quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments\nShort-term investments are held to their maturities and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. The short-term investments consist of instruments with maturities greater than three months and less than one year. All other instruments measured by the Company at fair value, including derivatives and contingent consideration liabilities, are immaterial to the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\nIn fiscal year 2022, the Company recorded non-cash asset impairment charges of $11 million to Cost of products sold in the Life Sciences segment, $19 million to Acquisition-related integration and restructuring expense in the Medical segment and $54 million to Cost of products sold in the Medical segment to write down the carrying value of certain fixed assets. In fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded charges to Cost of products sold of $40 million to write down the carrying value of certain fixed assets. The amounts recognized in 2022 and 2021 were recorded to adjust the carrying amount of assets to the assets' fair values, which were estimated, based upon a market participant's perspective, using Level 3 inputs, including values estimated using the income approach.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company maintains cash deposits in excess of government-provided insurance limits. Such cash deposits are exposed to loss in the event of nonperformance by financial institutions. Substantially all of the Companys trade receivables are due from public and private entities involved in the healthcare industry. Due to the large size and diversity of the Companys customer base, concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited. The Company does not normally require collateral. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by financial institutions with which it conducts business. However, this loss is limited to the amounts, if any, by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed the obligations of the Company. The Company also minimizes exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions.\nThe Company continually evaluates its accounts receivables for potential collection risks, particularly those resulting from sales to government-owned or government-supported healthcare facilities in certain countries, as payment may be dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of those countries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nnational economies. The Company continually evaluates all governmental receivables for potential collection risks associated with the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices. The Company believes the current reserves related to all governmental receivables are adequate and that this concentration of credit risk will not have a material adverse impact on its financial position or liquidity.\nTransfers of trade receivables\nOver the normal course of its business activities, the Company transfers certain trade receivable assets to third parties under factoring agreements. Per the terms of these agreements, the Company surrenders control over its trade receivables upon transfer. Accordingly, the Company accounts for the transfers as sales of trade receivables by recognizing an increase to Cash and equivalents and a decrease to Trade receivables, net when proceeds from the transactions are received. The costs incurred by the Company in connection with factoring activities were not material to its consolidated financial results. The amounts transferred and yet to be remitted under factoring arrangements are provided below.\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2021\nTrade receivables transferred to third parties under factoring arrangements $ 2,615 $ 1,215 $ 1,189\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022\nAmounts yet to be collected and remitted to the third parties 357 323\nNote 16 - Debt\nCurrent debt obligations\nThe carrying value of Current debt obligations, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, at September 30 consisted of:\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022\nCommercial paper borrowings $ - $ 230\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n1.000% Notes due December 15, 2022\n(a) - 487\n1.401% Notes due May 24, 2023\n(a) - 292\n0.632% Notes due June 4, 2023\n(a) - 779\n0.000% Notes due August 13, 2023\n(a) - 390\n3.875% Notes due May 15, 2024\n144 -\n3.363% Notes due June 6, 2024\n997 -\nTotal current debt obligations $ 1,141 $ 2,179\n(a)All of the aggregate principal amount outstanding was retired upon maturity during 2023, as further discussed below.\nThe weighted average interest rates for current debt obligations were 3.43% and 1.00% at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFrom time to time, the Company may access the commercial paper market as it manages working capital over the normal course of its business activities. In March 2023, the Company amended the agreement for its U.S. commercial paper program, which provided, among other things, an increase of the maximum amount of unsecured borrowings available under the program to $2.750 billion. Also in March 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to establish a multicurrency euro commercial paper program. This multicurrency program allows for a maximum amount of unsecured borrowings that, when aggregated with the amount outstanding under the U.S. commercial paper program, will not exceed $2.750 billion at any time. Proceeds from these\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nprograms may be used for working capital purposes and general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions, share repurchases and repayments of debt. The Company utilized commercial paper borrowings in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 of which $230 million was outstanding as of September 30, 2022. There were no such borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2023.\nLong-term debt\nThe carrying value of Long-Term Debt, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, at September 30 consisted of:\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022\n3.875% Notes due May 15, 2024\n- 145\n3.363% Notes due June 6, 2024\n- 996\n3.734% Notes due December 15, 2024\n874 873\n3.020% Notes due May 24, 2025\n306 275\n0.034% Notes due August 13, 2025\n528 485\n1.208% Notes due June 4, 2026\n634 583\n6.700% Notes due December 1, 2026\n161 165\n1.900% Notes due December 15, 2026\n528 485\n3.700% Notes due June 6, 2027\n1,719 1,718\n7.000% Debentures due August 1, 2027\n119 119\n4.693% Notes due February 13, 2028\n(a) 796 -\n6.700% Debentures due August 1, 2028\n115 116\n0.334% Notes due August 13, 2028\n949 872\n3.553% Notes due September 13, 2029\n(a) 842 -\n2.823% Notes due May 20, 2030\n745 745\n1.957% Notes due February 11, 2031\n993 992\n4.298% Notes due August 22, 2032\n496 495\n1.213% Notes due February 12, 2036\n631 580\n6.000% Notes due May 15, 2039\n121 121\n5.000% Notes due November 12, 2040\n90 90\n1.336% Notes due August 13, 2041\n945 869\n4.875% Notes due May 15, 2044\n245 246\n4.685% Notes due December 15, 2044\n899 911\n4.669% Notes due June 6, 2047\n1,445 1,449\n3.794% Notes due May 20, 2050\n554 554\nOther long-term debt 2 -\nTotal Long-Term Debt $ 14,738 $ 13,886\n(a)Represents notes issued during 2023, as further discussed below.\nThe aggregate annual maturities of Long-Term Debt including interest during the fiscal years ending September 30, 2024 to 2028 are as follows: 2024 - $1.625 billion; 2025 - $2.161 billion; 2026 - $1.073 billion; 2027 - $2.916 billion; 2028 - $2.183 billion.\nOther current credit facilities\nThe Company has a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility in place which will expire in September 2026. The credit facility, which was amended and restated in January 2023, provides borrowings of up to $2.750 billion, with separate sub-limits of $100 million and $194 million for letters of credit and\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nswingline loans, respectively. The expiration date of the credit facility may be extended for up to two additional one year periods, subject to certain restrictions, including the consent of the lenders. The credit facility provides that the Company may, subject to additional commitments by lenders, request an additional $500 million of financing, for a maximum aggregate commitment under the credit facility of up to $3.250 billion. Proceeds from this facility may be used for general corporate purposes and Becton Dickinson Euro Finance S.\u00e0 r.l. (\"Becton Finance\"), an indirect, wholly-owned finance subsidiary of BD, is authorized as an additional borrower under the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Companys revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2023. In addition, the Company has informal lines of credit outside of the United States.\nDebt issuances\nThe Company issued the following U.S. dollar-denominated debt during fiscal years 2023 and 2022:\nInterest rate and maturity Period issued Amount issued (Millions of dollars) Use of proceeds\n4.693% notes due February 13, 2028\nSecond quarter 2023 $ 800 Retirement of 1.401% notes due May 24, 2023 and 0.000% notes due August 13, 2023\n4.298% notes due August 22, 2032\nFourth quarter 2022 $ 500 Fourth quarter 2022 debt retirements detailed below\nAlso in fiscal year 2023, Becton Finance issued Euro-denominated notes, listed below, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company. No other of the Company's subsidiaries provide any guarantees with respect to these notes. The indenture covenants included a limitation on liens and a restriction on sale and leasebacks, change of control and consolidation, merger and sale of assets covenants. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, limitations and qualifications. The indenture does not restrict the Company, Becton Finance, or any other of the Company's subsidiaries from incurring additional debt or other liabilities, including additional senior debt. Additionally, the indenture does not restrict Becton Finance and the Company from granting security interests over its assets. The notes issued by Becton Finance included the following:\nInterest rate and maturity Period issued Amount issued (Millions of Euros) Amount issued (Millions of dollars) Use of proceeds\n3.553% notes due September 13, 2029\nSecond quarter 2023 \u20ac 800 $ 868 Retirement of 0.632% notes due June 4, 2023\nDebt retirements\nThe Companys retirements of debt upon maturity in fiscal year 2023 included the following:\nPrincipal, interest rate and maturity Period of retirement\n400 million Euros ($439 million) of 0.000% notes due August 13, 2023\nFourth quarter 2023\n800 million Euros ($857 million) of 0.632% notes due June 4, 2023\nThird quarter 2023\n300 million Euros ($325 million) of 1.401% notes due May 24, 2023\nThird quarter 2023\n500 million Euros ($528 million) of 1.000% notes due December 15, 2022\nFirst quarter 2023\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nOn August 8, 2022, the Company commenced a series of tender offers to purchase for cash, certain of its outstanding senior notes. Proceeds from the notes issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 plus cash on hand were used to pay for the tender offers. As a result of the tender, the Companys retirements of debt in fiscal year 2022 included the following:\n(Millions of dollars)\nPrincipal, interest rate and maturity Period of retirement Carrying value Market price of retirement (a) (Gain) loss recognized to Other expense, net (b)\n$190 million of 3.794% notes due 2050\nFourth quarter 2022 $ 188 $ 163 $ (25)\n$52 million of 7.000% debentures due 2027\nFourth quarter 2022 54 59 5\n$55 million of 6.700% debentures due 2028\nFourth quarter 2022 56 62 5\n$127 million of 6.000% notes due 2039\nFourth quarter 2022 125 145 20\n$34 million of 5.000% notes due 2040\nFourth quarter 2022 34 35 1\n$42 million of 4.685% notes due 2044\nFourth quarter 2022 43 42 (1)\n(a)Included accrued interest, related premiums, fees and expenses.\n(b)Debt retirement was accounted for as an early debt extinguishment.\nTo mitigate the impact of rate volatility on the total tender cash spend, the Company executed reverse Treasury locks that were unwound concurrent with the tender at a loss of $17 million.\nSpin-off-related debt transactions\nIn February 2022, Embecta, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, issued $500 million of 5.000% senior secured notes due February 15, 2030, in advance of the Companys spin-off of Embecta, which is further discussed in Note 2.\nOn March 31, 2022, Embecta entered into an indenture dated April 1, 2022 to issue $200 million of 6.750% senior secured notes due February 15, 2030. These notes were issued to the Company as part of the consideration for assets transferred to Embecta in connection with the spin-off. After the spin-off was effective on April 1, 2022, the Company exchanged these notes for $199 million of the aggregate principal amount outstanding on the Companys Floating Rate Notes due June 6, 2022, which were purchased through a tender offer. The carrying value of the long-term notes tendered was $199 million, and the Company recognized a loss on this debt extinguishment of $2 million, which was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 within Other expense, net, on the Companys consolidated statements of income.\nAlso in connection with the spin-off, on March 31, 2022, Embecta issued a senior secured term loan facility with an aggregate principal amount of $950 million and a senior secured revolving credit facility providing borrowings of up to $500 million that was undrawn at March 31, 2022 and at the spin-off date.\nThe senior secured notes and credit agreement for the term loan and revolving credit facilities were guaranteed on an unsecured, unsubordinated basis solely by the Company prior to the spin-off date. The Companys guarantees automatically and unconditionally terminated upon the consummation of the spin-off on April 1, 2022.\nOn March 31, 2022, Embecta used a portion of the proceeds from the financing transactions discussed above to make a cash distribution of approximately $1.266 billion to the Company.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nCapitalized interest\nThe Company capitalizes interest costs as a component of the cost of construction in progress.

The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized benefits will change during the next twelve months due to one or more of the following events: expiring statutes, audit activity, tax payments, other activity, or final decisions in matters that are the subject of controversy in various taxing jurisdictions in\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nwhich we operate. However, the Company does not expect changes to have a significant effect on its results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2021\nBalance at October 1 $ 267 $ 354 $ 611\nIncrease due to acquisitions - 2 2\nIncrease due to current year tax positions 22 40 23\nIncrease due to prior year tax positions 33 60 5\nDecreases due to prior year tax positions (29) - (4)\nDecrease due to settlements with tax authorities (6) (77) (183)\nDecrease due to lapse of statute of limitations (18) (112) (100)\nBalance at September 30 $ 269 $ 267 $ 354\nUnrecognized tax benefits that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized $ 366 $ 348 $ 447\nUpon the Company's acquisition of CareFusion in 2015, the Company became a party to a tax matters agreement with Cardinal Health resulting from Cardinal Health's spin-off of CareFusion in fiscal year 2010. Under the tax matters agreement, the Company is obligated to indemnify Cardinal Health for certain tax exposures and transaction taxes prior to CareFusions spin-off from Cardinal Health. The indemnification payable is approximately $132 million at September 30, 2023 and is included in Deferred Income Taxes and Other Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe following were included for the years ended September 30 as a component of Income tax provision on the consolidated statements of income.\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2021\nInterest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits\n$ 20 $ (6) $ 5\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions. The IRS has completed its audit for the BD legacy fiscal year 2014, BD combined company fiscal years 2015 and 2017, and CareFusion legacy fiscal years 2010 through short period 2015. With regard to Bard, all examinations have been completed through short period 2017. The IRS has commenced its review of BDs fiscal years 2018 through 2020. For the other major tax jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, tax years are generally open after 2016.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes at September 30 consisted of:\n2023 2022\n(Millions of dollars) Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities\nCompensation and benefits $ 426 $ - $ 430 $ -\nProperty and equipment - 409 - 412\nIntangibles - 1,858 - 2,064\nLoss and credit carryforwards 2,352 - 2,185 -\nProduct recall and liability reserves 362 - 133 -\nCapitalized research and development expenses (a) 243 - 63 -\nOther 531 183 524 260\n3,914 2,450 3,335 2,736\nValuation allowance (2,272) - (2,093) -\nNet (b) $ 1,642 $ 2,450 $ 1,242 $ 2,736\n(a)As required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Companys research and development expenditures were capitalized and amortized in fiscal year 2023 for income tax purposes. This resulted in an increase in cash tax paid in fiscal year 2023 with a corresponding deferred tax benefit.\n(b)Net deferred tax assets are included in Other Assets and net deferred tax liabilities are included in Deferred Income Taxes and Other Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are netted on the balance sheet by separate tax jurisdictions. The Company asserts indefinite reinvestment for all historical unremitted foreign earnings as of September 30, 2023. Deferred taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of September 30, 2023 since the determination of the total amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable.\nGenerally, deferred tax assets have been established as a result of net operating losses and credit carryforwards with expiration dates from 2024 to an unlimited expiration date. Valuation allowances have been established as a result of an evaluation of the uncertainty associated with the realization of certain deferred tax assets on these losses and credit carryforwards. The valuation allowance at September 30, 2023 is primarily the result of foreign losses due to the Companys global re-organization of its foreign entities and these generally have no expiration date. Valuation allowances are also maintained with respect to deferred tax assets for certain state carryforwards that may not be realized.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nTax Rate Reconciliation\nA reconciliation of the federal statutory tax rate to the Companys effective income tax rate for continuing operations was as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\nFederal statutory tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState and local income taxes, net of federal tax benefit (1.0) (1.1) (2.7)\nForeign income tax at rates other than 21% (8.2) (7.3) (6.4)\nEffect of foreign operations (3.9) 5.6 (1.0)\nEffect of Research Credits and FDII/Domestic Production Activities (3.2) (2.2) (2.0)\nEffect of share-based compensation (0.4) (1.7) 0.1\nEffect of gain on divestitures 3.2 - -\nEffect of valuation allowance release - (5.5) (2.2)\nOther, net 0.4 (0.5) (1.6)\nEffective income tax rate 7.9 % 8.3 % 5.2 %\nTax Holidays and Payments\nThe approximate tax impacts related to tax holidays in various countries in which the Company does business are provided below.

The Company identifies a contract that contains a lease as one which conveys a right, either explicitly or implicitly, to control the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration. The Companys lease arrangements are generally classified as operating leases. These arrangements have remaining terms ranging from less than one year to approximately 25 years and the weighted-average remaining lease term of the Companys leases is approximately 6.7 years. An option to renew or terminate the current term of a lease arrangement is included in the lease term if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option.\nThe Company does not recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for short-term leases, which have terms of 12 months or less, on its consolidated balance sheet. For the longer-term lease arrangements that are recognized on the Companys consolidated balance sheet, the right-of-use asset and lease liability is initially measured at the commencement date based upon the present value of the lease payments due under the lease. These payments represent the combination of the fixed lease and fixed non-lease components that are due under the arrangement. The costs associated with the Companys short-term leases, as well as variable costs relating to the Companys lease arrangements, are not material to its consolidated financial results.\nThe implicit interest rates of the Companys lease arrangements are generally not readily determinable and as such, the Company applies an incremental borrowing rate, which is established based upon the information available at the lease commencement date, to determine the present value of lease payments due\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nunder an arrangement. The weighted-average incremental borrowing rate that has been applied to measure the Companys lease liabilities is 3.2%.\nThe Companys lease costs recorded in its consolidated statements of income for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $145 million, $138 million and $132 million, respectively. Cash payments arising from the Companys lease arrangements are reflected on its consolidated statement of cash flows as outflows used for operating activities. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities recognized on the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022\nRight-of-use assets recorded in Other Assets\n$ 517 $ 482\nCurrent lease liabilities recorded in Accrued expenses\n117 118\nNon-current lease liabilities recorded in Deferred Income Taxes and Other Liabilities\n414 384\nThe Companys payments due under its operating leases are as follows:\n(Millions of dollars)\n2024 $ 132\n2025 114\n2026 89\n2027 62\n2028 45\nThereafter 153\nTotal payments due 595\nLess: imputed interest 64\nTotal $ 531\nSale-Leaseback Transactions\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company sold certain properties and concurrently entered into operating lease arrangements for each property, which met the requirements for sale-leaseback accounting. The Company recorded gross proceeds of $225 million related to the transactions and pre-tax gains of $158 million were recorded in Other operating (income) expense, net. The lease agreements have initial lease terms between two and three years and include options for the Company to extend the leases for an additional six-to-twelve months.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nNote 19 - Supplemental Financial Information\nOther Expense, Net\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2021\nOther investment (losses) gains, net (a) $ (3) $ (35) $ 57\nDeferred compensation 32 (46) 43\nNet pension and postretirement benefit cost (b) (98) (17) (1)\nLosses on undesignated foreign exchange derivatives, net (36) (28) (13)\nImpacts of debt extinguishment (c) - (24) (178)\nEmbecta service agreements income, net (d) 59 33 -\nOther - 1 (6)\nOther expense, net $ (46) $ (117) $ (99)\n(a)The amounts include (losses) gains recognized relating to certain equity investments.\n(b)Represents all components of the Companys net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, aside from service cost, including pension settlement expenses of $57 million and $73 million in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(c)Represents losses recognized upon the extinguishment of certain senior notes, as further discussed in Note 16.\n(d)Consists of net income from transition and logistics service agreements with Embecta following the spin-off of the former diabetes care business in fiscal year 2022, as further discussed in Note 2.\nTrade Receivables, Net\nThe amounts recognized in 2023, 2022 and 2021 relating to allowances for doubtful accounts and cash discounts, which are netted against trade receivables, are provided in the following table:\n(Millions of dollars) Allowance for\nDoubtful\nAccounts Allowance for\nCash\nDiscounts Total\nBalance at September 30, 2020 $ 76 $ 12 $ 88\nAdditions charged to costs and expenses 17 84 101\nDeductions and other (20) (a) (77) (97)\nBalance at September 30, 2021 $ 73 $ 18 $ 91\nAdditions charged to costs and expenses 4 73 77\nDeductions and other (12) (a) (75) (87)\nBalance at September 30, 2022 $ 65 $ 16 $ 81\nAdditions charged to costs and expenses 9 100 109\nDeductions and other (10) (a) (100) (110)\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ 65 $ 16 $ 81\n(a)Accounts written off.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nInventories\nInventories at September 30 consisted of:\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022\nMaterials $ 714 $ 707\nWork in process 381 397\nFinished products 2,178 2,120\n$ 3,273 $ 3,224\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net at September 30 consisted of:\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022\nLand $ 131 $ 127\nBuildings 3,537 3,252\nMachinery, equipment and fixtures 9,609 8,769\nLeasehold improvements 301 266\n13,578 12,415\nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization 7,021 6,402\n$ 6,557 $ 6,012 Item 9.
