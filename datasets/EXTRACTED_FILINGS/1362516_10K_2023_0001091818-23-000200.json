    "content": "Item 1. Business.\nThe Company\nThe Company was initially incorporated on November 15, 1999, as Menu Sites, Inc., a Florida corporation. On March 9, 2001, the Companys name was changed to CNE Communications, Inc. On October 1, 2004, the name was changed to CNE Industries, Inc. and on March 29, 2005, the name was changed to GlobalTel IP, Inc. On May 9, 2008, the Companys name was changed to Cleartronic, Inc.\nAll current operations are conducted through the Companys wholly owned subsidiary, ReadyOp Communications, Inc. (ReadyOp), a Florida corporation incorporated on September 15, 2014. ReadyOp facilitates the marketing and sales of subscriptions to the ReadyOp\u2122 and ReadyMed \u2122 platform and the AudioMate IP gateways discussed below.\nIn March 2018, the Company approved the spin-off VoiceInterop into a separate company under a Form S-1 registration to be filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. On May 13, 2019, VoiceInterop filed an S-1 registration with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. All VoiceInterop transactions have been recorded as discontinued operations. On February 14, 2020, the distribution of shares was approved by FINRA and VoiceInterop was deconsolidated from Cleartronic, Inc. (See Note 6).\nIn October 2019, the Company acquired the ReadyMed software platform from Collabria LLC. ReadyMed is a web-based secure communications platform initially designed for the healthcare industry. This includes hospitals, clinics, doctors offices, health insurance companies, workers compensation insurance companies and many other segments of the healthcare industry. The Company offers both the ReadyOp and ReadyMed capabilities to clients and usually refers to the platform as ReadyOp to avoid confusion in the marketplace of two platforms.\nReadyOp\u2122 Software\nReadyOp is a proprietary, innovative web-based planning and communications platform for efficiently and effectively planning, managing, communicating, and directing operations and emergency response. ReadyOp is used by local, state and federal government agencies, corporations, school districts, utilities, hospitals and others to manage and report daily operations as well as the ability to handle incidents and emergency situations. ReadyOp is offered as a software as a service (SAAS) program on an annual contract basis although an increasing number of clients have requested multi-year agreements.\nReadyOp requires no new or on-site hardware or programming by clients and provides multiple options for communications including radio interoperability using the Companys AudioMate gateways. Plans and operations can be built and stored securely in ReadyOp on a by-location, region and systemwide basis. Assets can be listed along with their location, person to contact and other information that may be needed. Diagrams, charts, maps, pictures, report forms and other documentation can be securely stored yet immediately available securely from any location. ReadyOp also provides efficient planning and response for responding to disasters and for continuity of operations (COOP) and recovery. ReadyOp is the COOP platform for multiple organizations including many federal agencies.\nReadyMed\u2122 Software\nIn October 2019, the Company acquired the ReadyMed software platform from Collabria LLC. In exchange for this asset, the Company issued 12,000,000 shares of Common stock of the Company. ReadyMed is a web-based secure communications platform initially designed for the healthcare industry. This includes hospitals, clinics, doctors offices, health insurance companies, workers compensation insurance companies and many other segments of the healthcare industry. The platform provides caregivers with patient tracking capability and allows physicians and other healthcare entities to track patient progress after medical treatment and/or release from hospital care. The software also enables monitoring and reporting of patients in medium- and long-term care. Additionally, the platform provides secure communications capabilities and recordkeeping to track the healing process of patients, record their recovery and monitor their medications. During the COVID-19 pandemic this software proved beneficial to multiple federal and state agencies and clients in the healthcare industry. The Company offers both the ReadyOp and ReadyMed capabilities to clients and usually refers to the platform as ReadyOp to avoid confusion in the marketplace of two products.\nAudioMate IP Gateways\nThe Company offers a proprietary line of Internet Protocol Gateways branded as AudioMate 360 IP Gateway. The AudioMate 360 IP Gateway was designed to provide an Internet Protocol Gateway to users of unified group communications. The AudioMate units are currently being sold directly to end-users by the Companys sales teams and by Value Added Resellers (VARs). More than 1,000 end-users in the United States and 18 foreign countries have purchased the Companys AudioMate gateways. Although other devices are available that perform the same or similar functions, we believe that our price for the AudioMate 360 IP Gateway is competitive with prices other companies are charging for similar devices.\nPatents and Intellectual Property\nOur business will be dependent in part on our intellectual property. For projects that are in development, we intend to rely on intellectual property rights afforded by trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures, licensing arrangements and potential patent filings. These measures are to establish and protect our rights to the technology and other intellectual property. We cannot foretell if these procedures and arrangements will be adequate in protecting our intellectual property.\nOn March 13, 2012, the United States Patent Office notified the Company that U.S. Patent Number 8,135,001 B1 had been granted for the 34 claims of our patent application for Multi Ad Hoc Interoperable Communicating Networks. We may file similar patent applications in additional countries. The claims in the patent application relate to various aspects of the AudioMate 360 IP Gateway. It may be that one or more of the claims are not meaningful. Furthermore, the validity of issued patents is frequently challenged by others. One or more patent applications may have been filed by others previous to our filing, which encompass the same or similar claims. A patent application does not in and of itself grant exclusive rights. A patent application must be reviewed by the Patent Office of each relevant country prior to issuing as a patent and granting exclusive rights. The laws of many foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States, if at all.\nBecause of limited resources, the Company may be unable to protect a patent, either owned or licensed, or to challenge others who may infringe upon a patent. Because many holders of patents have substantially greater resources and patent litigation is very expensive, we may not have the resources necessary to successfully challenge the validity of patents held by others or withstand claims of infringement or challenges to any patent the Company may possess or obtain. Even if we prevail, the cost and management distraction of litigation could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nInternet Protocol Gateways and their related manufacturing processes are covered by a large number of patents and patent applications. Infringement actions may be instituted against the Company if we use or are suspected of using technology, processes or other subject matter that is claimed under patents of others. An adverse outcome in any future patent dispute could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed or require us to cease using the infringed technology.\nIf trade secrets and other means of protection upon which the Company relies may not adequately protect us, the Companys intellectual property could become available to others. Although we may rely on trade secrets, copyright law, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect some of our intellectual property, these measures may not provide meaningful protection to the Company.\nExclusive Licensing Agreement\nOn May 5, 2017, the Company entered into an Exclusive Licensing Agreement with Sublicensing Terms (the Agreement) with the University of South Florida Research Foundation, Inc. (USFRF) relating to an exclusive license of certain patent rights in connection with one of USFRFs U.S. Patent Applications. Both parties recognize that the research and development work provided by the Company was sufficient for USFRF to enter into the Agreement with the Company.\nThe Agreement is effective April 25, 2017 and continues until the later of the date that no Licensed Patent remains a pending application or an enforceable patent or the date on which the Licensees obligation to pay royalties expires.\nThe Company paid USFRF a License Issue Fee of $6,000 and $2,373 as reimbursement of expenses associated with the filing of the Licensed Patent for the year ended September 30, 2023. The company agreed to pay USFRF a royalty of 3% for sales of all Licensed Products and Licensed Processes and agreed to pay USFRF minimum royalty payments as follows:\nPayment Year\n$1,000\n$4,000\n$8,000\n-and every year thereafter on the same date, for the life of the agreement.\nIn the event the Company proposes to sell any Equity Securities, then USFRF will have the right to purchase 5% of the securities issued in such offering on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other purchasers in such financing.\nRapid Technological Change Could Render the Companys Products Obsolete\nThe Companys markets are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, uncertain product life cycles, changes in customer requirements, and evolving industry standards. The introduction of new products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete. The Companys future success will depend upon our ability to continue to develop and introduce new products and services to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of customers. The Company may experience delays in releasing new products, product enhancements and services in the future which may cause customers and prospective to forego purchase and use of our products and purchase those of competitors.\nSales to government entities are subject to a number of challenges and risks.\nThe ReadyOp platform is a Cloud Service Offering (CSO) that is being used by several agencies of the federal government. In order to expand the usage by additional federal government agencies the Company is in the process of obtaining a FedRAMP Authorization. FedRAMP provides a standardized security framework for all cloud products and services that is recognized by all executive branch federal agencies. As a Cloud Service Provider or CSP the Company only needs to go through the FedRAMP Authorization process once for each CSO and perform continuous monitoring, with all agencies reviewing the same continuous monitoring deliverables, creating efficiencies across the government. The Company commenced the FedRamp certification process in 2023 and expects to have completed the certification by mid 2024.\nSeasonality of Our Business\nWe do not anticipate that our business will be affected by seasonal factors.\nImpact of Inflation\nWe are affected by inflation along with the rest of the economy. Specifically, our costs to complete our products could rise if specific components needed incur an increase in cost.\nManufacturing and Suppliers\nWe have outsourced the manufacturing of our AudioMate 360 IP Gateway. This outsourcing has allowed us to:\n\u25cf Avoid costly capital expenditures for the establishment of manufacturing operations;\n\u25cf Focus on the design, development, sales and support of our products and services; and\n\u25cf Leverage the scale, expertise and purchasing power of specialized contract manufacturers.\nCurrently, Company has arrangements for the production of the AudioMate gateways with two contract manufacturers. The reliance on contract manufacturing involves a number of potential risks, including the absence of adequate capacity, ownership of certain elements of electronic designs, and reduced control over delivery schedules. The Companys contract manufacturers can provide a range of operational and manufacturing services, including component procurement and performing final testing and assembly of our products. The Company intends to continue use of contract manufacturers to procure components and to maintain adequate manufacturing capacity.\nCompetition\nWe are not aware of any direct competitors for ReadyOp and ReadyMed that offer the same combinations of capabilities and function. However, there are similar programs being marketed that appear similar and are sometimes confused with ReadyOp such as WebEOC and Everbridge. ReadyOp provides different capabilities and is priced lower than both of these and in fact, has several clients that use one or even both of these programs in addition to ReadyOp. We may have increased competition in the future. We continue to develop and enhance the ReadyOp/ReadyMed platform to improve the value and increase the potential market size and growth of our client clientele.\nThe unified communications industry where the Companys gateways are offered is competitive. The Company will continue to offer the AudioMate gateways, but primarily in conjunction with the ReadyOp platform to provide radio interoperability. Competition for an integrated radio and operations platform is limited and the Company will continue to market the ReadyOp platform, both with the gateways and without.\nSales and Marketing\nThe ReadyOp/ReadyMed platform is currently marketed through a combination of inside salespersons and outside sales groups. We intend to expand the use of commissioned sales groups and individual sales representatives to market and sell our programs and gateways.\nKey Personnel of Cleartronic\nOur future financial success depends to a large degree upon the personal efforts of our key personnel, Michael M. Moore, our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Director, and Larry M. Reid, our Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Secretary and Director. They and their designees play the major role in securing persons capable of developing and executing the Companys business strategy. While the Company intends to employ additional executive, development and technical personnel in order to minimize dependency upon any one person, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the persons needed.\nAt present, Cleartronic has two executive officers, Michael M. Moore and Larry M. Reid. A copy of the employment agreement with Mr. Moore has been previously filed on January 13, 2016 as an exhibit to a Form 10-K. Mr. Moore is paid a base salary of $16,667 per month. Effective April 20, 2022, the annual compensation increased to $220,000. See Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence.\nIn March 2015, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with the Companys CFO, Larry M. Reid (the Agreement). Under the Agreement, Mr. Reid agreed to remit 2.0 billion shares of common stock back to the Company in exchange for 200,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred stock with a fair value of $252,000. Mr. Reid is paid a base salary of $8,000 per month. A copy of the employment agreement with Mr. Reid has been previously filed on March 18, 2015 with the SEC as an exhibit to a Form 8-K. Effective October 1, 2021, the annual compensation increased to $104,000.\nUnless the Company shall have given Mr. Moore or Mr. Reid written notice at least 30 days prior to the Termination Date, the employment agreements automatically renew and continue in effect for additional one-year periods. The Company has the election at any time after the expiration of the initial term of the Mr. Reids Agreement to give Mr. Reid notice of Termination.\nThe Financial Results for Cleartronic May Be Affected by Factors Outside of Our Control\nOur future operating results may vary from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control. Our anticipated expense levels are based, in part, on our estimates of future revenues and may vary from projections. We may be unable to adjust spending rapidly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenue in relation to our planned expenditures could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Further, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future performance.\nTransfer Agent\nOur transfer agent is ClearTrust, LLC, whose address is 16540 Pointe Village Drive, Suite 206, Lutz, Florida 33558, and telephone number is (813) 235-4490.\nCompany Contact Information\nOur principal executive offices are located at 28050 US Highway 19 N., Ste 310, Clearwater, FL 33761, telephone (813) 240-0307.

Legal Proceedings.\nCleartronic is not engaged in any litigation at the present time and management is unaware of any claims or complaints that could result in future litigation. Management will seek to minimize disputes with the Companys customers but recognizes the inevitability of legal action in todays business environment as an unfortunate price of conducting business. Item 4. Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nThe Companys common stock has been traded on the OTCPINK under the symbol CLRI. The last price of our common stock as reported on the pink tier of OTC Markets on September 30, 2023 was $0.0281 per share.\nAs of September 30, 2023 we were authorized to issue 5,000,000,000 shares of our common stock, of which 229,160,695 shares were outstanding. Our shares of common stock are held by approximately 218 stockholders of record. The number of record holders was determined from the records of our transfer agent and does not include beneficial owners of our common stock whose shares are held in the names of various securities brokers, dealers, and registered clearing agencies. In addition to our authorized common stock, Cleartronic has designated 200,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of which 7,317,403 shares are issued or outstanding. There is no trading market for the shares of our preferred stock.\nDividends\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends or other distributions on the Companys common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Companys board of directors and will depend, among other things, on the earnings and financial requirements for future operations and growth, and other facts as the board of directors may then deem appropriate. See Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters, for a description of the preferred stock and dividend rights pertaining to the preferred stock.\nThe Company is obligated to pay dividends on its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Each Series A Preferred Holder is entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 8% of $1.00 per annum for each outstanding share of Series A Preferred then held by such Series A Preferred Holder, on a pro rata basis. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the cumulative arrearage of undeclared dividends totalled $206,181 and $165,144, respectively.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nExcept for those unregistered securities previously disclosed in reports filed with the Securities Exchange Commission during the period covered by this report, we have not sold any securities under the Securities Act of 1933.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nNone Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\nNot applicable. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nTHE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.\nMANAGEMENT DISCUSSION\nThe following discussion reflects the Companys plan of operation. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements which are attached to this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expected financial position, business and financing plans. These statements involve risks and uncertainties. The actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly under the headings Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\nUnless the context otherwise suggests, we, our, us, and similar terms, as well as references to Cleartronic, all refer to Cleartronic, Inc. and our subsidiaries as of the date of this report.\nResults of Operations\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nRevenue\nRevenues increased 5.67% to $2,131,955 for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $2,017,563 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The primary reason for the increase was an increase in revenue from the ReadyOp platform from $1,818,035 in 2022 to $2,022,550 in 2023. There was also an increase in sales of ReadyOp hardware products from $33,800 in 2022 to 48,325 in 2023. Consulting fees and related income decreased from $86,000 in 2022 to $32,850 in 2023 due primarily to a decrease in sales of thermal scanners as these were primarily purchased by clients for operations during the COVID 19 pandemic.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenues decreased to $316,163 for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $334,138 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Gross profits were $1,815,792 and $1,683,425 for the years ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Gross profit margins increased to 85.17% for the year ended September 30, 2023 from 83.44% for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased 32.49% to $1,761,843 for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to $1,329,791 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase was primarily due to administrative expenses and selling expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $270,184 or 26.14% as a result of the increase in general business expenses, an increase in headcount and personnel related costs associated with the addition of new employees. In addition, the Companys paid fees to outside consulting services that are assisting us in obtaining FedRAMP certification. For the year ended September 30, 2023, $59,324 was paid in connection with FedRamp certification. There were also charitable contributions and employee holiday bonuses paid during the year. For the year ended September 30, 2023, selling expenses were $425,498 compared to $272,521 for the year ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due expenses associated with a trade show hosted by the Company and bad debt expense. There was also an increase in advertising and travel expenses as the Company increased its sales and marketing efforts following the COVID 19 pandemic. Research and development expenses were $27,314 for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $19,742 for the year ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to research and development expenses.\nOther Income/(Expenses)\nThe Companys other income decreased by $44,654 from other income of $2,607 during the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $47,261 in other expenses for the year ended September 30, 2022. The primary reason for this decrease was an increase in interest income on note receivable due from a related party and offset by a settlement of certain accounts payable for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nIncome before Income Taxes\nThe Companys income before income taxes was $56,556, during the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $400,895 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to expensing audit expenses, a move of the corporate headquarters, the addition of new employees, employee related costs and costs associated with FedRAMP certification. The increased costs were partially offset by an increase in subscriptions of ReadyOp licenses.\nNet Income Attributable to Common Stockholders\nNet income attributable to common stockholders was $15,518 for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to a net income of $359,858 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in administrative and offset by an increase in sales of ReadyOp licenses. The increased costs were partially due expenses related to a move of the corporate headquarters and the addition of new employees. The preferred stock dividends remained consistent.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided in operations of $99,595 was the result of a net income of $56,556, depreciation and amortization expense of $5,051, amortization of operating lease of $17,949, provision of bad debt of $97,994, an increase in accounts payable of $10,640, and a decrease in inventory of $816. These were offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $105,537, increase in prepaid expenses of $17,635 and an increase in deferred revenue of $52,169.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, net cash used in operations of $74,649 was the result of a net income of $400,895, depreciation expense of $3,732, provision of bad debt of $14,000, gain on settlement and reversal of accounts payable of $47,792, an increase in accounts receivable of $231,785, and a decrease of accounts payable of $36,943. These were offset by an increase in inventory of $6,444, an increase in prepaid expenses of $6,228, and an increase in deferred revenue of $6,285.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $50,807 for the year ended September 30, 2023 which was for the purchase of fixed assets of $6,434, and intangible assets of $44,374.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $ $7,483 for the year ended 2022, which was for the purchase of fixed assets of $7,483.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable in the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company maintains current receivable amounts with most of its customers. The Company regularly monitors and assesses its risk of not collecting amounts owed by customers. This evaluation is based upon an analysis of current and past due amounts, along with relevant history and facts particular to the customer. The Company records its allowance for credit losses based on the results of this analysis. The analysis requires the Company to make significant estimates and as such, changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the allowance for credit losses. The Company considers as past due any receivable balance not collected within its contractual terms.\nThe Company provided $63,665 and $18,000 allowances for doubtful accounts as of September 30, 2023, and September 30, 2022, respectively.\nInventory\nInventory consists of components held for assembly and finished goods held for resale or to be utilized for installation in projects. Inventory is valued at lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. The Companys policy is to record a reserve for technological obsolescence or slow-moving inventory items. The Company only carries finished goods to be shipped along with completed circuit boards and parts necessary for final assembly of finished product. All existing inventory is considered current and usable.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe recent accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) or other standard setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statement upon adoption.\nThe recent accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statement appearing elsewhere in this report.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nNot applicable. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe financial statements and related notes are included as part of this report as indexed in the appendix on page, et seq. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure and Controls and Procedures. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined) in Exchange Act Rules 13a - 15(c) and 15d - 15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and (2) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to us, including our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThe term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78a ,et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commissions rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuers management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the registrant have been detected.

Moore\nMichael M. Moore, Chief Executive Officer\nBy /s/ Larry M. Reid\nLarry M. Reid, Chief Financial Officer and\nPrincipal Accounting Officer\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (PCAOB ID 5036)\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Cleartronic, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cleartronic, Inc. (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flow for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nValuation of accounts receivable\nDescription of the Matter\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company provides an allowance for credit losses based upon a periodic review and analysis of outstanding accounts receivable balances. Uncollectible receivables are charged to the allowance when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are used to credit the allowance account in the periods in which the recoveries are made.\nHow We addressed the Matter in our Audit\nThe primary procedures performed included evaluating the methodologies used in the determination of allowance for credit losses and reviewing historical data, collections and other inputs used by the Company as well as subsequent collections. Based on our procedures we deemed the Companys treatment of accounts receivable and the corresponding allowance for credit losses to be appropriate as of September 30, 2023.\nAssurance Dimensions\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2022.\nMargate, Florida\nDecember 21, 2023\nCLEARTRONIC, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARY\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nNOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION\nCleartronic, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in Florida on November 15, 1999. All current operations are conducted through the Companys wholly owned subsidiary, ReadyOp Communications, Inc. (ReadyOp), a Florida corporation incorporated on September 15, 2014. ReadyOp facilitates the marketing and sales of subscriptions to the ReadyOp\u2122 and ReadyMed \u2122 platforms and the AudioMate IP gateways discussed below.\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements contain the consolidated accounts of Cleartronic, Inc. and its subsidiary, ReadyOp Communications, Inc. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and operations for the reporting period.\nAlthough these estimates are based on managements knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results.\nSignificant estimates include the assumptions used in valuation of deferred tax assets, estimated useful life of property and equipment, valuation of inventory and allowance for credit losses.\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nFor financial statement purposes, the Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nThe Company has investments Treasury Bills. The Treasury Bills have remaining terms ranging from four-week month to thirteen weeks on September 30, 2023.\nTreasury Bills with an original maturity date of three months or less are included within cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet at September 30, 2023.\nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe Company maintains current receivable amounts with most of its customers. The Company regularly monitors and assesses its risk of not collecting amounts owed by customers. This evaluation is based upon an analysis of current and past due amounts, along with relevant history and facts particular to the customer. The Company records its allowance for credit losses based on the results of this analysis. The analysis requires the Company to make significant estimates and as such, changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the allowance for credit losses. The Company considers as past due any receivable balance not collected within its contractual terms.\nThe Company provided $63,665 and $18,000 allowances for doubtful accounts as of September 30, 2023, and September 30, 2022, respectively.\nPREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets consist primarily of deferred subscriber costs and prepaid expenses. Deferred subscriber costs totalling $38,250 and $38,250 at September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Prepaid expenses totalling $30,272 and $15,361 at September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively.\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset or the underlying lease term for leasehold improvements, whichever is shorter or when the property and equipment is put into service.\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe Companys intangible assets consist of fees paid to outside consulting services that are assisting us in obtaining FedRAMP certification. At September 30, 2023, The Company had intangible assets with a cost of approximately $44,373, with finite lives. The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite lives over the shorter of their estimated useful or legal life. The useful life is reevaluated for each reporting period. For the year ended September 30, 2023, no amortization expense was recorded.\nThe Company evaluates intangible assets with finite lives for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. The Company determined that none of its intangible assets were impaired during the year ended September 30, 2023.\nCONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK\nThe Company currently maintains cash balances at one FDIC-insured banking institution. Deposits held in non interest-bearing transaction accounts are insured up to a maximum of $250,000 at all FDIC-insured institutions. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Company had $118,140 and $208,135, respectively, in excess of FDIC insurance limits.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS\nThe Company expenses research and development costs as incurred.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $27,314 and $19,742 respectively, in research and development costs. Salary expenses for the year ended September 30, 2022 were reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION AND DEFERRED REVENUES\nThe Company revenue recognition policy follows guidance from Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from contract with customers. Revenue is recognized when the Company has transferred promised goods and services to the customer and in the amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount:\ni. Identification of Contact with a customer;\nii. Identify the performance obligation of the contract\niii. Determine transaction price;\niv. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and\nv. Recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.\nThe Company generates revenue primarily through the sale of software licenses and integrated hardware. The portion of the contract that is associated with ongoing hosting and related customer service is amortized monthly over the license period. The Company incurs certain incremental contract costs (referred to as deferred subscriber acquisition costs, net) including selling expenses (primarily commissions) related to acquiring customers. Deferred subscriber acquisition costs, net are included in prepaid and expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Commissions paid in connection with acquiring new customers are determined based on the value of the contractual fees. Deferred subscriber acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred on the date the revenue associated with the cost is recognized.\nIn transactions in which hardware is sold to a customer, the Company recognizes the revenue when the hardware has been shipped to the customer. The hardware supplied by the Company does not require a related software license and can be operated and fully functional without the Companys software.\nFrom time to time clients request special training meetings. We send employees to these meeting and charge our clients on a per diem basis. These charges are recorded as consulting fees on our income statement.\nCustomer billings for services not yet rendered are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are provided. These fees are recorded as current deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet as the Company expects to satisfy any remaining performance obligations as well as recognize the related revenue within the next twelve months. Accordingly, the Company has applied the practical expedient regarding deferred revenue to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations if (i) the contract has an original expected term of one year or less or (ii) the Company recognizes revenue in proportion to the amount it has the right to invoice for services performed. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively, the Company recorded $1,177,680 and $1,125,511, respectively, in deferred revenue.\nDISAGGREGATED REVENUE\nThe following table sets forth the approximate net sales by primary category:\nSchedule of disaggregated revenue\nFor the years ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2022\nLicensing of ReadyOp Software $ 2,022,550 $ 1,818,035\nHardware Sales and Consulting 109,405 199,528\nTotal $ 2,131,955 $ 2,017,563\nDEFERRED REVENUE\nThe following table provides a summary of the changes included in deferred revenue during the year ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022:\nSchedule of deferred revenue\nFor the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2023\nFor the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nBeginning balance $ 1,125,511 $ 1,131,796\nAdditions to deferred liability (1) 2,184,124 2,011,278\nDeductions to deferred liability (2) (2,131,955 ) (2,017,563 )\nEnding balance $ 1,177,680 $ 1,125,511\n(1)\nCustomer billings for services not yet rendered\n(2)\nRevenue recognized in the current year related to the deferred liability\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nEarnings per share (EPS) are the amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience, the term is used to refer to either earnings or loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16, basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Income available to common stockholders shall be computed by adding both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement, stock options or warrants.\nPursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-45-21 through 260-10-45-45-23 Diluted EPS shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate or exercise price from the standpoint of the security holder. The dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants (and their equivalents) issued by the reporting entity shall be reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method unless the provisions of paragraphs 260-10-45-35 through 45-36 and 260-10-55-8 through 55-11 require that another method be applied. Equivalents of options and warrants include non-vested stock granted to employees, stock purchase contracts, and partially paid stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260-10-55-23). Anti-dilutive contracts, such as purchased put options and purchased call options, shall be excluded from diluted EPS. Under the treasury stock method: a. Exercise of options and warrants shall be assumed at the beginning of the period (or at time of issuance, if later) and common shares shall be assumed to be issued. b. The proceeds from exercise shall be assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. (See paragraphs 260-10-45-29 and 260-10-55-4 through 55-5.) c. The incremental shares (the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed purchased) shall be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS computation.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had no options and warrants outstanding.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had 512,996 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock outstanding, which are convertible into 51,299,600 shares of common stock.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had 3,133,503 and 3,341,503 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred stock outstanding, respectively, which are convertible into 15,947,515 and 16,707,515 shares of common stock, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had 670,904 shares of Series D Preferred stock outstanding which are convertible into 3,354,520 shares of common stock.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had 3,000,000 shares of Series E Convertible Preferred stock outstanding which are convertible into 300,000,000 shares of common stock.\nThe table below details the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022:\nSchedule of diluted earnings per share\nFor the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2023\nFor the year ended\nSeptember\n30, 2022\nNet income attributable to common stockholders for the period $ 15,518 $ 359,858\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding 228,786,339 228,239,979\nBasic earnings per share $ 0.00 $ 0.00\nThe following table sets for the computation of diluted earnings per share:\nSchedule of computation of diluted earnings per share\nFor the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2023\nFor the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nNet income attributable to common stockholders for the period $ 15,518 $ 359,858\nAdd: Preferred stock dividends 41,038 41,037\nAdjusted net income $ 56,556 $ 400,895\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding 228,786,339 228,239,979\nAdd: Shares issued upon conversion of preferred stock 370,321,635 371,361,635\nWeighted average number of common and common equivalent shares 599,107,974 599,601,614\nDiluted earnings per share $ 0.00 $ 0.00\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company measures the fair value of its assets and liabilities under ASC topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There was no impact relating to the adoption of ASC 820 to the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nASC 820 also describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\n- Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets.\n- Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n- Level 3: Inputs that are generally observable. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in managements best estimate of fair value.\nFinancial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet approximate their fair values due to their relatively short-term nature. The carrying amounts approximate fair value. It is managements opinion that the Company is not exposed to any significant currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we held no assets that were required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nINVENTORY\nInventory consists of components held for assembly and finished goods held for resale or to be utilized for installation in projects. Inventory is valued at lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. The Companys policy is to record a reserve for technological obsolescence or slow-moving inventory items. The Company only carries finished goods to be shipped along with completed circuit boards and parts necessary for final assembly of finished product. All existing inventory is considered current and usable. The Company recorded no reserve for obsolete inventory as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively.\nAt September 30, 2023 inventory was $21,913 of raw materials.\nAt September 30, 2022, inventory was $21,097 of raw materials.\nADVERTISING COSTS\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company had advertising costs of $95,373 and $51,318 during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nRECENT ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nTroubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures\nIn March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (ASU 2022-02), which eliminates the accounting guidance on troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) for creditors in ASC 310, Receivables (Topic 310), and requires entities to provide disclosures about current period gross write-offs by year of origination. Also, ASU 2022-02 updates the requirements related to accounting for credit losses under ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), and adds enhanced disclosures for creditors with respect to loan refinancings and restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. ASU 2022-02 was effective for the Company October 1, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2022-02 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nRECENT ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nThe Company continues to monitor new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB and does not believe any accounting pronouncements issued through the date of this report will have a material impact on the Companys Financial Statements.\nIn the current year, the Company adjusted its classification of selling and administrative expenses in the Statement of Operations. For comparative purposes, amounts in the prior years have been reclassified to conform to current year presentations. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported results of operations or retained earnings.\nLEASE ACCOUNTING\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception and record the leases in our financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor.\nWe have a lease agreement with lease and non-lease components and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor perspective with the exception of direct sales-type leases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease components and associated lease component and, the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease.\nWe have elected not to present short-term leases on the balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease inception and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise. All other lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because our lease does not provide an implicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nIn general, leases, where we are the lessee, may include options to extend the lease term. These leases may include options to terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.\nLease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate. We calculate the present value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date.\nDifferences between the calculated lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred. Amortization of finance lease assets is recognized over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset.\nOn December 2, 2022, and effective on January 1, 2023, the Company signed a two-year lease of 1,145 square feet for our principal offices in Clearwater, Florida. The monthly rent is $2,134 in year one and increases to $2,198 in year two. The lease expires on December 31, 2024.\nThe tables below present information regarding the Companys operating lease assets and liabilities at September 30, 2023:\nSchedule of operating lease assets and liabilities\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2022\nAssets\nOperating lease -right-of-use assets-non-current $ 29,914 $ -\nLiabilities\nOperating lease liability $ 31,087 $ -\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years) 1.25 -\nWeighted-average discount rate 8 % -\nThe componets of lease expense were as follows:\nOperating lease cost\nAmorization on right-of-use operating lease asset $ 17,949 $ -\nLease liability expense in connection with obligation repayment 2,429 -\nTotal operating lease costs $ 20,378 $ -\nSupplemental cash outflows information related to operation lease was as follows:\nOperating cash outflows from operating lease (obligation payment) $ 19,206 $ -\nRight-of-use asset obtained in exchange for new operating lease liability $ 47,863 $ -\nAt September 30, 2023, the Company has no financing leases as defined in ASC 842, Leases.\nFuture minimum lease payments required under leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year at September 30, 2023:\nSchedule of future minimum lease payments required under leases\n$ 26,184\n6,594\nTotal undiscounted cash flows 32,778\nLess: amount representing interest (1,691 )\nPresent value of operating lease liability 31,087\nLess: current portion of operation lease liability 24,580\nLong-term operating lease liability $ 6,507\nNOTE 3 - PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nAt September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, property and equipment, net, is as follows:\nSchedule of property and equipment net\nFor the year\nended\nSeptember 30, 2023\nFor the year\nended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nOffice Equipment $ 28,040 $ 21,605\nLess: Accumulated Depreciation (11,514 ) (6,463 )\nTotal Property and Equipment, net $ 16,526 $ 15,142\nAt September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, intangible assets, net, is as follows:\nSchedule of intangible assets\nFor the year\nended\nSeptember 30, 2023\nFor the year\nended\nSeptember\n30, 2023\nIntangible Assets 44,373 -\nTotal Intangible Assets, net $ 44,373 $ -\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, was $5,051 and $3,732, respectively.\nNOTE 4 - EQUITY TRANSACTIONS\nPreferred Stock Dividends\nAs of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the cumulative arrearage of undeclared dividends for Series A Preferred stock totaled $205,658 and $165,144, respectively and $41,038 for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nAs of the date of this report, we have 200,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of which 7,373,403 shares were issued and outstanding.

As of September 30, 2023, the Company recorded $2,724 in interest receivable - related party.\nNOTE 6 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nObligation Under Operating Lease\nOn December 2, 2022, and effective on January 1, 2023, the Company signed a two-year lease of 1,145 square feet for our principal offices in Clearwater, Florida. The monthly rent is $2,134 in year one and increases to $2,198 in year two. The lease expires on December 31, 2024. On January 1, 2023, upon adoption of ASC 842, the Company will recognize right-to-use assets as operating leases and operating lease obligations.\nOn December 1, 2021, the Company signed a one year lease approximately 2,000 square feet for our principal offices in Boca Raton, Florida. The monthly rent is $2,200. The lease expired on November 30, 2022.\nRent expense incurred during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $22,722 and $26,973, respectively.\nRevenue and Accounts Receivable Concentration\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, one customer accounted for 11.13% of the Companys revenues.\nNo customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys revenue for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nAs of September 30, 2023, no customers accounted for more than 10% of the Companys total outstanding accounts receivable.\nAs of September 30, 2022, no customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys total outstanding accounts receivable.\nMajor Supplier and Sole Manufacturing Source\nThe Company relies on no major supplier for its products. The Company has contracted with local manufacturing facilities to provide completed circuit boards used in the assembly of its IP gateway devices. Interruption of adequate supply of components, primarily computer chips, to the manufacturing source presents additional risk to the Company. The Company believes that additional commercial facilities exist at competitive rates to match the resources and capabilities of its existing manufacturing source, but the current worldwide shortage of computer chips does limit our ability to supply our proprietary radio gateways to clients and other buyers.\nEmployment Agreements\nIn December 2016, the Board of Directors accepted the resignation of Larry M. Reid as Chief Executive Officer of the corporation and appointed Mr. Reid as Chief Financial Officer. The Board also appointed Michael M.

The term of agreement is for a one-year period beginning on the effective date and shall automatically renew and continue in effect for additional one-year periods. Effective October 1, 2021, the annual compensation increased to $104,000.\nExclusive Licensing Agreement\nOn May 5, 2017, the Company entered into an Exclusive Licensing Agreement with Sublicensing Terms (the Agreement) with the University of South Florida Research Foundation, Inc. (USFRF) relating to an exclusive license of certain patent rights in connection with one of USFRFs U.S. Patent Applications. Both parties recognize that the research and development work provided by the Company was sufficient for USFRF to enter into the Agreement with the Company.\nThe Agreement is effective April 25, 2017 and continues until the later of the date that no Licensed Patent remains a pending application or an enforceable patent or the date on which the Licensees obligation to pay royalties expires.\nThe Company agreed to pay USFRF a royalty of 3% for sales of all Licensed Products and Licensed Processes and agreed to pay USFRF minimum royalty payments of $8,000 for fiscal year 2022 and thereafter on the same date, for the life of the agreement.\nIn the event the Company proposes to sell any Equity Securities, then USFRF will have the right to purchase 5% of the securities issued in such offering on the same terms and conditions are offered to other purchasers in such financing. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company has recorded $6,000 and $8,000 for the minimum royalty for the fiscal year ended 2023 and 2022.\nNOTE 7 - DEFERRED INCOME TAXES\nThe provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.\nUncertain tax positions are recognized only when the Company believes it is more likely than not that the tax position will be upheld on examination by the taxing authorities based on the merits of the position. The Company has no material unrecognized tax benefits and no adjustments to its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows were required as of September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company filed consolidated tax returns for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, which are subject to examination by federal and state tax jurisdictions. No income tax returns are currently under examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The Company did not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2023 and 2022. The Companys U.S. federal income tax returns for tax years 2020 through 2023 are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.\nThe Company calculates its deferred tax assets based upon its consolidated net operating loss (NOL) carryovers available to offset future taxable income, net of other tax credit(s) or tax deferred liabilities, if any. No deferred tax assets for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 have been recorded since any available deferred tax assets are fully offset by increases in its valuation allowances. The Company increased its valuation allowance based on its history of consolidated net losses. At September 30, 2023, the Company has an adjusted net operating loss carryforward of approximately $13,608,000 that expire through 2040. Should a cumulative change in the ownership of more than 50% occur within a three-year period, there could be an annual limitation on the use of the net operating loss carryforwards.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes plus any available consolidated, net deferred tax credits. Significant components of the Companys net deferred income tax assets at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively are as follows:\nSchedule of deferred income tax assets\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2022\nDepreciation $ 1,750 $ 2,842\nAllowance for credit losses 40,717 15,880\nNet operating loss carryforward 3,449,013 3,493,201\nNet deferred income tax asset 3,491,480 3,511,923\nLess: valuation allowance (3,491,480 ) (3,511,923 )\nTotal deferred income tax assets $ - $ -\nA reconciliation of the Federal and respective State income tax rate as a percentage of income before taxes is as follows:\nSchedule of income tax rate as a percentage\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2022\nFederal statutory taxes $ 11,224 $ 79,558\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit 3,111 22,049\nChange in tax estimates 26,586\nLess: Valuation allowance, non-deductible items 3,267 2,100\nChange in valuation allowance (44,188 ) (104,557 )\n$ -0- $ -0-\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2022\nFederal statutory Income tax rate 21.00 % 21.00 %\nState taxes, net of federal benefit 4.35 % 4.35 %\nEffective rate of deferred tax asset 25.35 % 25.35 %\nLess: Valuation allowance (25.35 %) (25.35 %)\nEffective income tax rate 0.00 % 0.00 %\nManagement has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not use the NOL carryforward and has a 100% valuation allowance against the deferred asset. The reserve is based on historical experience of the Companys operations as it has not recognized net income in its current incarnation and there is no indication of any events or conditions that would show that trend will not continue due to the Companys current expectation of expense requirements."
