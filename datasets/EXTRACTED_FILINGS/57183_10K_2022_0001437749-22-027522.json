    "content": "Item 1. Business\nOVERVIEW\nSpire Inc. (Spire) was formed in 2000 and is the holding company for Spire Missouri Inc. (Spire Missouri), Spire Alabama Inc. (Spire Alabama), other gas utilities, and gas-related businesses. Spire Missouri was formed in 1857 and Spire Alabama was formed in 1948 by the merger of two gas companies. Spire is committed to transforming its business and pursuing growth through growing organically, investing in infrastructure, and advancing through innovation. The Company has two key business segments: Gas Utility and Gas Marketing.\nThe Gas Utility segment includes the regulated operations of Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama, Spire Gulf Inc. (Spire Gulf) and Spire Mississippi Inc. (Spire Mississippi) (collectively, the Utilities). The business of the Utilities is subject to seasonal fluctuations with the peak period occurring in the winter heating season, typically November through April of each fiscal year. Spire Missouri is a public utility engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas, with primary offices located in St. Louis, Missouri. Spire Missouri is the largest natural gas distribution utility system in Missouri, serving approximately 1.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in St. Louis, Kansas City, and other areas in Missouri. Spire Alabama is a public utility engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas principally in central and northern Alabama, serving more than 0.4 million residential, commercial and industrial customers with primary offices located in Birmingham, Alabama. Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi are utilities engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas to 0.1 million customers in the Mobile, Alabama area and south-central Mississippi.\nThe Gas Marketing segment includes Spire Marketing Inc. (Spire Marketing), a wholly owned subsidiary providing natural gas marketing services.\nAs of September 30, 2022, Spire had 3,584 employees, including 2,347 for Spire Missouri and 1,009 for Spire Alabama. We believe that:\n1.\nthe safety and well-being of our employees is one of our most important responsibilities,\n2.\nthe development, education and advancement of employees is key to our sustainability, and\n3.\nembracing an inclusive workforce full of diverse backgrounds and perspectives drives innovation.\nWe continue to implement processes, procedures and programs that have helped us reduce our employee injury rate for the eighth fiscal year in a row, marking a 21% year-over-year improvement and an overall improvement of 67% since fiscal year 2015. We offer incentives for weight management and gym membership, as well as employee assistance programs to provide counseling services and emotional support, and we have a formalized comprehensive well-being program that focuses on the physical, emotional, social and financial health of every employee.\nAll employees have access to developmental assessments, customized training, specialized degree programs, and partnerships with best-in-class organizations related to industry courses, leadership and management workshops and computer application development seminars. In addition, all employees are eligible for up to $6,000 per year in tuition assistance and have access to the Spire Learning Center, our robust internal learning management system. In their first year, construction and maintenance employees and service employees receive 160-200 hours of technical and safety training. Field operations employees average 40 hours annually of training and Operator Qualification instruction.\nWe regularly review and adjust our affirmative action plans based on placement and utilization rates, and we strive to create an even more diverse and inclusive work environment by committing to and achieving the goals of the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion Pledge. Our Human Rights Policy demonstrates that Spire understands its universal responsibility to respect human rights and provides the basis for publicly affirming our values and embedding the responsibility into Spires operations and the way we do business.\nSpire uses its website, SpireEnergy.com, as its primary channel for distribution of important information including news releases, analyst presentations and financial information. The information Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama file or furnish to the United States (U.S.) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and their amendments, and proxy statements are available free of charge under Filings & reports in the Investors section of Spires website, SpireEnergy.com, as soon as reasonably practical after the information is filed with or furnished to the SEC. Information contained on Spires website is not incorporated by reference in this report. The SEC also maintains a website that contains Spires SEC filings (sec.gov).\nGAS UTILITY\nNatural Gas Supply\nThe Utilities fundamental gas supply strategy is to meet the two-fold objective of 1) ensuring a dependable gas supply is available for delivery when needed and 2) insofar as is compatible with that dependability, purchasing gas that is economically priced. In structuring their natural gas supply portfolio, the Utilities focus on natural gas assets that are strategically positioned to meet the Utilities primary objectives.\nSpire Missouri focuses its gas supply portfolio around a number of large natural gas suppliers with equity ownership or control of assets strategically situated to complement its regionally diverse firm transportation arrangements. Spire Missouri utilizes Midcontinent, Gulf Coast, Northeast, and Rocky Mountain gas sources to provide a level of supply diversity that facilitates the optimization of pricing differentials as well as protecting against the potential of regional supply disruptions. Further, Spire STL Pipeline LLC (Spire STL Pipeline), a wholly owned subsidiary of Spire, may deliver up to 400,000 million British thermal units (MMBtu) per day of natural gas into eastern Missouri, of which Spire Missouri is the foundation shipper with a contractual commitment of 350,000 MMBtu per day. See related discussion under the caption -The Utilities ability to meet their customers natural gas requirements may be impaired if contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline and/or storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner under Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in Note 15, Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nIn fiscal year 2022, Spire Missouri purchased natural gas from 24 different suppliers to meet its total service area current gas sales and storage injection requirements. Spire Missouri entered into firm agreements with suppliers including major producers and marketers providing flexibility to meet the temperature-sensitive needs of its customers. Natural gas purchased by Spire Missouri for delivery to its service areas included 48.3 billion cubic feet (Bcf) through the Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, Inc. (Southern Star) system, 26.3 Bcf through the Spire STL Pipeline, 26.3 Bcf through the Enable Mississippi River Transmission LLC (MRT) system, 6.3 Bcf through the Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, LP (PEPL) system, 5.5 Bcf through the Rockies Express Pipeline, LLC (REX) system, and 4.5 Bcf through the Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transmission, LLC (TIGT) system. Spire Missouri also holds firm transportation arrangements on several other interstate pipeline systems that provide access to gas supplies upstream. Some of Spire Missouris commercial and industrial customers purchased their own gas with Spire Missouri transporting 52.0 Bcf to them through its distribution system.\nThe fiscal year 2022 peak day send out of natural gas to Spire Missouri customers, including transportation customers, occurred on January 20, 2022. The average temperature was 11 degrees Fahrenheit in both St. Louis and Kansas City. On that day, Spire Missouris customers consumed 1.58 Bcf of natural gas. For eastern Missouri, this peak day demand was met with natural gas transported to St. Louis through the MRT, Missouri Gas Pipeline LLC, Spire STL Pipeline, and Southern Star transportation systems, and from Spire Missouris on-system storage. For western Missouri, this peak day demand was met with natural gas transported to Kansas City through the Southern Star, PEPL, TIGT, and REX transportation systems.\nSpire Alabamas distribution system is connected to two major interstate natural gas pipeline systems, Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C. (Southern Natural Gas) and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco). It is also connected to two intrastate natural gas pipeline systems.\nSpire Alabama purchases natural gas from various natural gas producers and marketers. Certain volumes are purchased under firm contractual commitments with other volumes purchased on a spot market basis. The purchased volumes are delivered to Spire Alabamas system using a variety of firm transportation, interruptible transportation and storage capacity arrangements designed to meet the systems varying levels of demand.\nIn fiscal 2022, Spire Alabama purchased natural gas from 27 different suppliers to meet current gas sales, storage injection, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) liquefaction requirements, of which one supplier is under a long-term supply agreement. Approximately 68.2 Bcf was purchased for delivery by Southern Natural Gas, 3.7 Bcf by Transco, and 11.0 Bcf through intrastate pipelines to the Spire Alabama delivery points for its residential, commercial, and industrial customers.\nThe fiscal 2022 peak day send out for Spire Alabama was 0.5 Bcf on February 14, 2022, when the average temperature was 32 degrees Fahrenheit in Birmingham, of which 100% was met with supplies transported through Southern Natural Gas, Transco, and intrastate facilities.\nSpire Gulfs distribution system is directly connected to interstate pipelines, natural gas processing plants and gas storage facilities. Spire Gulf buys from a variety of producers and marketers, with BP Energy Company being the primary supplier.\nNatural Gas Storage\nSpire Missouri believes it currently has ample storage capacity to meet the demands of its distribution system, particularly to augment its supply during peak demand periods; however, see related discussion of Spire STL Pipeline under the caption -The Utilities ability to meet their customers natural gas requirements may be impaired if contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline and/or storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner under Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in Note 15, Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Spire Missouri has a contractual right to store 21.5 Bcf of gas in MRTs storage facility located in Unionville, Louisiana, 16.3 Bcf of gas storage in Southern Stars system storage facilities located in Kansas and Oklahoma, and 1.4 Bcf of firm storage on PEPLs system storage. MRTs tariffs allow injections into storage from May 1 through November 1 and require the withdrawal from storage of all but 4.3 Bcf from November 1 through May 1. Southern Star tariffs allow both injections and withdrawals into storage year-round with ratchets that restrict the associated flows dependent upon the underlying inventory level per the contracts.\nIn addition, Spire Missouri supplements pipeline gas with natural gas withdrawn from its own underground storage field located in St. Louis and St. Charles Counties in Missouri. The field is designed to provide approximately 0.3 Bcf of natural gas withdrawals on a peak day, and provides the ability to reinject natural gas during the heating season to replenish or increase deliverability, subject to maximum annual net withdrawals of approximately 4.0 Bcf of natural gas based on the inventory level that Spire Missouri plans to maintain.\nSpire Alabama has a contractual right to store 12.7 Bcf of gas with Southern Natural Gas, 0.5 Bcf of gas with Gulf South Pipeline, 0.2 Bcf of gas with Transco and 0.2 Bcf of gas with Tennessee Gas Pipeline. In addition, Spire Alabama has 2.0 Bcf of LNG storage that can provide the system with up to an additional 0.2 Bcf of natural gas daily to meet peak day demand.\nSpire Gulf obtains adequate storage capacity through Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP, and Enstor Gas, LLCs Bay Gas Storage.\nUnion Agreements\nThe Company believes labor relations with its employees are good. Should that condition change, the Company could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions that could negatively impact the Companys system operations, customer service, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe following table presents the Companys various labor agreements as of September 30, 2022:\nEmployees\nContract Start\nContract End\nUnion\nLocal\nCovered\nDate\nDate\nSpire Missouri\nUnited Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber Manufacturing, Allied-Industrial and Service Workers International Union (USW)\nAugust 10, 2021\nJuly 31, 2024\nUSW\n11-6\nAugust 1, 2021\nJuly 31, 2024\nUSW 11-6-03 August 1, 2021 July 31, 2024\nUSW\nAugust 1, 2022\nJuly 31, 2025\nUSW\nAugust 1, 2022\nJuly 31, 2025\nUSW\n11-267\nAugust 1, 2022\nJuly 31, 2025\nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers\nOctober 1, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2025\nGas Workers Metal Trades locals of the United Association of Journeyman and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry of the United States and Canada\n781-Kansas City\nAugust 1, 2022\nJuly 31, 2025\nGas Workers Metal Trades locals of the United Association of Journeyman and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry of the United States and Canada\n781-Monett\nAugust 1, 2022\nJuly 31, 2025\nTotal Spire Missouri\n1,484\nSpire Alabama\nUSW\nMay 1, 2020\nApril 30, 2023\nUnited Association of Gas Fitters\nMay 1, 2022\nApril 30, 2025\nTotal Spire Alabama\nSpire Gulf\nUSW\nAugust 1, 2020\nJuly 31, 2023\nTotal Spire\n2,008\nOperating Revenues and Customer Information\nThe following tables present information on Spires revenues and volume sold and transported (before intersegment eliminations), and annual average numbers of customers for the three years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nGas Utility Operating Revenues\n(% of Total)\nResidential\n%\n%\n%\nCommercial & Industrial\n%\n%\n%\nTransportation\n%\n%\n%\nOther\n%\n%\n%\nTotal\n%\n%\n%\nGas Utility Volume Sold and Transported\n(In millions of CCF)\nResidential\n994.7\n1,069.6\n1,033.5\nCommercial & Industrial\n468.9\n479.0\n464.1\nTransportation\n1,617.6\n1,614.7\n1,637.8\nInterruptible\n11.8\n15.0\n14.5\nTotal System\n3,093.0\n3,178.3\n3,149.9\nOff-System\n82.0\n69.4\n83.2\nTotal\n3,175.0\n3,247.7\n3,233.1\nGas Utility Customers\nResidential\n1,618,515\n1,612,385\n1,599,693\nCommercial & Industrial\n113,077\n112,635\n112,566\nTransportation\n1,023\nInterruptible\nTotal\n1,732,665\n1,725,929\n1,713,173\nTotal annual average number of customers for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama for fiscal 2022 was 1,199,932 and 430,137, respectively.\nRegulatory Matters\nFor details on regulatory matters, see Note 15, Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nOther Pertinent Matters\nSpire Missouri is the only distributor of natural gas within its franchised service areas, while Spire Alabama is the main distributor of natural gas in its service areas. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have franchises in nearly all the communities where they provide service with terms varying from five years to an indefinite duration. A franchise is essentially a municipal permit to install and maintain pipes and construct other facilities in the community. All of the franchises are free from unduly burdensome restrictions and are adequate for the conduct of Spire Missouris and Spire Alabamas current public utility businesses in their respective states. In recent years, although certain franchise agreements have expired, the Utilities have continued to provide service in those communities without formal franchises.\nThe principal competition for the Utilities comes from the local electric companies. Other competitors in the service areas include suppliers of fuel oil, coal, and propane, as well as natural gas pipelines that can directly connect to large volume customers. Coal has been price competitive as a fuel source for very large boiler plant loads, but environmental requirements have shifted the economic advantage to natural gas. Oil and propane can be used to fuel boiler loads and certain direct-fired process applications, but these fuels require on-site storage, thus limiting their competitiveness. Competition also comes from district steam systems in the downtown areas of both St. Louis and Kansas City and from municipally or publicly owned natural gas distributors located adjacent to the Alabama service territories. Direct use of renewables will continue to grow in the future and compete against distributed generation using natural gas.\nResidential, commercial, and industrial customers represent approximately 94% and 81% of fiscal 2022 operating revenues for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively. Given the current level of natural gas supply and market conditions, the Utilities believe that the relative comparison of natural gas equipment and operating costs with those of competitive fuels will not change significantly in the foreseeable future, and that these markets will continue to be supplied by natural gas. In new multi-family and commercial rental markets, the Utilities competitive exposures are presently limited to space and water heating applications.\nSpire Missouri and Spire Alabama offer gas transportation service to its large commercial and industrial customers. Transportation customers represent approximately 3% and 15% of fiscal 2022 operating revenues for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively. The Spire Missouri tariff approved for that type of service produces a margin similar to that which Spire Missouri would have received under their regular sales rates. Similarly, Spire Alabamas tariff is based on Spire Alabamas sales profit margin so that operating margins are unaffected.\nThe Utilities are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that, to date, have not materially affected the Utilities or the Companys financial position and results of operations. For a detailed discussion of environmental matters, see Note 16, Commitment and Contingencies, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nGAS MARKETING\nSpire Marketing is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and related services throughout the United States, which includes customers within and outside of the Utilities service areas. For fiscal 2022 and 2021, Spire Marketing volumes averaged 1.73 Bcf/day and 2.02 Bcf/day, respectively. The majority of Spire Marketings business is derived from the procurement and physical delivery of natural gas to a diverse customer base, primarily in the central and southern U.S. Through its retail operations, Spire Marketing offers natural gas marketing services to large commercial and industrial customers, while its wholesale business consists of producers, pipelines, power generators, municipalities, storage operators, and utility companies. Wholesale activities currently represent a majority of the total Gas Marketing business. The Gas Marketing strategy is to leverage its market expertise and risk management skills to manage and optimize the value of its portfolio of commodity, transportation, park and loan, and storage contracts while controlling costs and acting on new marketplace opportunities.\nIn the course of its business, Spire Marketing enters into agreements to purchase natural gas at a future date in order to lock up supply to cover future sales commitments to its customers. To secure access to the markets it serves, Spire Marketing contracts for transportation capacity on various pipelines from pipeline companies directly and from other parties through the secondary capacity market. Throughout fiscal 2022, Spire Marketing held approximately 1.1 Bcf per day of firm transportation capacity. In addition, to ensure reliability of service and to provide operational flexibility, Spire Marketing enters into firm storage contracts and interruptible park and loan transactions with various companies, where it is able to buy and retain gas to be delivered at a future date, at which time it sells the natural gas to third parties. As of September 30, 2022, Spire Marketing has contracted for approximately 28.2 Bcf of such storage and park and loan capacity for the 2022-2023 winter season.\nOTHER\nOther components of the Companys consolidated information include:\nSpire's natural gas midstream operations consisting of Spire STL Pipeline and Spire Storage West LLC (Spire Storage), described below;\nSpires subsidiaries engaged in the operation of a propane pipeline and risk management, among other activities; and\nunallocated corporate items, including certain debt and associated interest costs.\nSpire STL Pipeline is a wholly owned subsidiary of Spire which owns and operates a 65-mile pipeline connecting the Rockies Express Pipeline in Scott County, Illinois, to delivery points in St. Louis County, Missouri, including Spire Missouris storage facility. Spire STL Pipelines operating revenue is derived primarily from Spire Missouri as its foundation shipper. The pipeline is under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and is currently permitted to deliver natural gas supply into eastern Missouri under a temporary certificate authorization from FERC. See related discussion under the caption -Failing to secure a permanent re-authorization of the Spire STL Pipeline to operate could adversely affect the Company under Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSpires and the Utilities business and financial results are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth below. The risks described below are those the Company and the Utilities consider to be material. When considering any investment in Spire or the Utilities securities, investors should carefully consider the following information, as well as information contained in the caption Forward-Looking Statements, Item 7A, and other documents Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama file with the SEC. This list is not exhaustive, and Spires and the Utilities respective management places no priority or likelihood based on the risk descriptions, order of presentation or grouping by subsidiary. All references to dollar amounts are in millions.\nRISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO THE BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS OF SPIRE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nClimate change and regulatory and legislative developments in the energy industry related to climate change may in the future adversely affect operations and financial results.\nClimate change, and regulatory, public policy, or legislative changes to address the potential for climate change, could adversely affect operations and financial results of the Company. Management believes it is likely that any such resulting impacts would occur over a long period of time and thus would be difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity. To the extent climate change results in warmer temperatures, financial results could be adversely affected through lower gas volumes and revenues and reduced marketing opportunities. Another possible impact of climate change may be more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, which could increase costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to customers or result in lost revenues if the Company were unable to deliver natural gas to customers. Such weather events could also disrupt our usual gas supplies and make it impossible or extremely costly to find replacement gas for our customers. To the extent such impacts are not covered by insurance or recovered in rates, the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, there have been a number of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in recent years in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions, such as methane and carbon dioxide. The adoption in the future of this type of legislation by Congress or similar legislation by states or localities, or the adoption of related regulations by federal, state or local governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, restricting the use of fossil fuels, such as natural gas, or restricting the construction of infrastructure necessary to deliver natural gas to customers could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry. Such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, affect the demand for natural gas or impact the prices charged to customers. At this time, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations that may be adopted on the Companys and the Utilities future business, financial condition or financial results.\nFailing to secure a permanent re-authorization of the Spire STL Pipeline to operate could adversely affect the Company.\nOn June 22, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued an order vacating the Spire STL Pipelines FERC certificates to operate and remanding the proceeding back to the FERC, which took effect on October 8, 2021. On September 14, 2021, and December 3, 2021, the FERC issued temporary certificates to allow the pipeline to continue operating indefinitely while it considers approval of a new permanent certificate.\nThe court decision to vacate the Spire STL Pipelines Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity previously issued by the FERC in 2018 could, depending on the course of action the FERC takes, cause a temporary or permanent halt in the natural gas supply transported by the pipeline or result in new regulatory conditions imposed on the pipeline, any of which could adversely affect the Company (including Spire Missouri) and our customers.\nSpire Missouri relies on the Spire STL Pipeline to transport natural gas into the St. Louis region. In the event the pipeline is taken out of service or even as a result of regulatory uncertainty and business constraints associated with ongoing temporary authorization of the pipeline, Spire Missouris customers, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted, which could result in a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations, as discussed under RISKS THAT RELATE TO THE GAS UTILITY SEGMENT below.\nIn addition, in the event the pipeline is taken out of service, the Companys financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted by impairment of Spire STL Pipelines assets, currently carried at over $270 million, and other effects. Spire STL Pipeline will continue to pursue all legal and regulatory avenues to ensure its continued and future operation.\nReductions in capacity of interconnecting, third-party pipelines could cause a reduction in volumes transported by the Spire STL Pipeline, which could adversely affect the Company.\nSpire STL Pipeline is dependent upon third-party pipelines and other facilities to provide delivery options to and from its pipeline. If any pipeline connection were to become unavailable for volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, Spire STL Pipelines ability to continue shipping natural gas to end markets could be restricted, and to the extent not mitigated by contractual indemnification, insurance or tariffs, would thereby reduce its revenues. Any permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect that causes a material reduction in volumes transported on its pipeline could result in an impairment loss that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a holding company, Spire depends on its operating subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations.\nSpire is a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of its operating subsidiaries and cash investments. Spire, and Spire Missouri prior to the holding companys formation in 2000, has paid common stock dividends continuously since 1946. Spires ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate sufficient net income and cash flows to pay upstream dividends and make loans or loan repayments. In addition, because it is a holding company and the substantial portion of its assets are represented by its holdings in the Utilities, the risks faced by the Utilities as described below under RISKS THAT RELATE TO THE GAS UTILITY SEGMENT may also adversely affect Spires cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nA downgrade in Spires and/or its subsidiaries credit ratings may negatively affect its ability to access capital and its cost of capital.\nCurrently, Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama have investment grade credit ratings. There is no assurance that such credit ratings for any of the Spire companies will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agencys judgment, circumstances so warrant. Spire has a working capital line of credit to meet its short-term liquidity needs. Spires line of credit may be used to meet the liquidity needs of any of its subsidiaries, subject to sublimits. If the rating agencies lowered the credit rating at any of these entities, particularly below investment grade, it might significantly limit that entitys ability to secure new or additional credit facilities and would increase its costs of borrowing. Spires or the Utilities ability to borrow under current or new credit facilities and costs of that borrowing have a direct impact on their ability to execute their operating strategies.\nPipeline integrity programs and repairs may impose significant costs and liabilities on the Company.\nThe U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate their pipelines and to take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in areas where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm. PHMSA constantly updates its regulations to ensure the highest levels of pipeline safety. As the operator of pipelines, Spire is required to:\nperform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;\nidentify and characterize applicable threats to pipelines;\nimprove data collection, integration and analysis;\nrepair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and\nimplement preventative and mitigating actions.\nThe Company is required to maintain pipeline integrity programs that are intended to assess pipeline integrity. Any repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures. Should the Company fail to comply with applicable statutes and the PHMSA Office of Pipeline Safetys rules and related regulations and orders, it could be subject to significant penalties and fines.\nTransporting, distributing, and storing natural gas and propane involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\nNatural gas transportation, distribution and storage activities inherently involve a variety of hazards and operations risks, such as leaks, accidental explosions, damage caused by third parties, and mechanical problems, which could cause substantial financial losses. In addition, these risks could result in serious injury to employees and non-employees, loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, and substantial losses to the Company and its subsidiaries. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. Similar risks also exist for Spire Missouris propane storage, transmission and minor distribution operations. These activities may subject the Company to litigation or administrative proceedings. Such litigation or proceedings could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, or penalties against the Company and its subsidiaries or be resolved on unfavorable terms. The Utilities and other Spire businesses are subject to federal and state laws and regulations requiring them to maintain certain safety and system integrity measures by identifying and managing storage and pipeline risks. Compliance with these laws and regulations, or future changes in these laws and regulations, may result in increased capital, operating and other costs which may not be recoverable in a timely manner from customers in rates. In accordance with customary industry practices, the Utilities and other Spire businesses maintain insurance against a significant portion, but not all, of these risks and losses. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these events is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nIn connection with acquisitions, Spire and Spire Missouri recorded goodwill and long-lived assets that could become impaired and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nSpire and Spire Missouri assess goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company and Spire Missouri assess their long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable. To the extent the value of goodwill or long-lived assets becomes impaired, the Company and Spire Missouri may be required to incur impairment charges that could have a material impact on their results of operations.\nSince interest rates are a key component, among other assumptions, in the models used to estimate the fair values of the Companys reporting units, rises in interest rates would generally decrease the calculated fair values and future impairments may occur. Due to the subjectivity of the assumptions and estimates underlying the impairment analysis, Spire and Spire Missouri cannot provide assurance that future analyses will not result in impairment. These assumptions and estimates include projected cash flows, current and future rates for contracted capacity, growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and market multiples.\nChanges to income tax policy, certain tax elections, tax regulations and future taxable income could adversely impact the Companys financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company has significantly reduced its current federal and state income tax obligations over the past few years through tax planning strategies including the use of bonus depreciation deductions for certain expenditures for property. As a result, the Company has generated large annual taxable losses that have resulted in significant federal and state net operating losses. The Company plans to utilize these net operating losses in the future to reduce income tax obligations. The value of these net operating losses could be reduced if the Company cannot generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all of the net operating losses generated prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 before they expire due to lower-than-expected financial performance or regulatory actions.\nChanges to income tax policy, laws and regulations, including but not limited to changes in tax rates, the deductibility of certain expenses including interest and state and local income taxes and/or changes in the deductibility of certain expenditures for property, could adversely impact the Company. Those impacts could include reducing the value of its net operating losses and could result in material charges to earnings. Further, the Companys financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Notably, the Inflation Reduction Act became effective on August 16, 2022. This new law provides various credits and incentives with respect to clean energy. The Company is evaluating the impact and applicability of these programs to its operations, but they are not expected to have a material impact on the Company.\nSpires pension and other postretirement benefit plans are subject to investment and interest rate risk that could negatively impact its financial condition.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries have pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide benefits to many of their employees and retirees. Costs of providing benefits and related funding requirements of these plans are subject to changes in the market value of the assets that fund the plans. The funded status of the plans and the related costs reflected in the Companys financial statements are affected by various factors, which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, including economic conditions, financial market performance, interest rates, life expectancies and demographics. Recessions and volatility in the domestic and international financial markets have negatively affected the asset values of Spires pension plans at various times in the past. Poor investment returns or lower interest rates may necessitate accelerated funding of the plans to meet minimum federal government requirements, which could have an adverse impact on the Companys and its subsidiaries financial condition and results of operations. For more information, including regulatory provisions affecting the Utilities plans, see Note 13, Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nThe Companys natural gas storage business includes inherent geologic and operational risks, as well as risks from competition and changes in market fundamentals.\nThe Company plans to continue to increase capacity, improve operating performance, and improve the integrity of its storage fields and associated above-ground facilities of Spire Storage. Construction of such assets is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including supply chain and labor disruptions, weather conditions during construction, equipment failures and construction quality issues. Any such disruptions, as well as any negative effects from the risks discussed below, could result in an impairment of Spire's investment in the project, and such impairment could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nAny damage to the Spire Storage facilities or pipelines, or lack of integrity to its storage fields, including damages caused by a blow-out, to the extent not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Companys storage assets are connected to third-party-owned pipelines. The continuing operation of such third-party pipelines is not within its control. If any of these pipelines become unable to transport, treat or process natural gas or natural gas liquids, or if the volumes it gathers or transports do not meet the quality requirements of such pipelines, the Companys revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe Company does not own all the land on which its storage facilities were constructed, and it is, therefore, subject to the possibility of more onerous terms or increased costs to retain necessary land use, if and when applicable property rights expire or are renewed. Changes in the terms of such land use could have an adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of the Companys storage business.\nSpire Storage is subject to competition from similar services provided by pipelines and from competing independent storage providers capable of serving its customers. Natural gas storage is a competitive business, with competitors having the ability to expand storage capacity. Increased competition in the natural gas storage business could reduce the demand and drive rates down for the Companys natural gas storage services.\nStorage businesses are affected by various gas market fundamentals which impact the level of demand for storage services and the rates that can be charged for these services. These market fundamentals include: seasonal price spread; monthly, daily and hourly price volatility; locational basis for pricing points on pipelines connected to a storage facility; seasonal, daily and hourly weather; and operational impacts in supply and market areas served by a storage facility and its connected pipelines. These fundamentals have varying and potentially material adverse impacts on the various services offered by storage facilities and the rates that can be charged for these services in the market. These services include long-term firm storage, short-term park and loan, wheeling, and optimization. Rates below the variable costs to operate a storage facility could result in a decision to not operate all the capacity in the facility or to operate the facility at a loss if required to fulfill firm customer contract obligations. A sustained decline in these rates or a shut-in of all or a portion of one or more facilities capacity could have an adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS THAT RELATE TO THE GAS UTILITY SEGMENT\nRegulation of the Utilities businesses may impact rates they are able to charge, costs, and profitability.\nThe Utilities are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities. At the state level, the Utilities are regulated in Missouri by the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC), in Alabama by the Alabama Public Service Commission (APSC), and in Mississippi by the Mississippi Public Service Commission (MSPSC). These state public service commissions regulate many aspects of the Utilities distribution operations, including construction and maintenance of facilities, operations, safety, the rates the Utilities may charge customers, the terms of service to their customers, transactions with their affiliates, the rate of return they are allowed to realize, and the accounting treatment for certain aspects of their operations. For further discussion of these accounting matters, see Regulatory Accounting under Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7.\nAccounting for the economics of rate regulation affects multiple financial statement line items (such as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; and operating expenses) and affects multiple disclosures in the Companys financial statements. There is a risk that the state public service commissions will not approve full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. A material disallowance of deferred costs could adversely affect the Utilities results of operations.\nThe MoPSC also approves Spire Missouris Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharge (ISRS). The ISRS allows Spire Missouri expedited recovery for its investment to upgrade its infrastructure and enhance its safety and reliability without the necessity of a formal rate case. Such investments are subject to review, and there is risk that any material disallowance of costs under ISRS could adversely affect the timing of revenues and cash flows.\nThe Utilities ability to obtain and timely implement rate increases and rate supplements to maintain the current rate of return is subject to regulatory review and approval. There can be no assurance that they will be able to obtain rate increases or rate supplements or continue earning the current authorized rates of return. Spire Alabamas and Spire Gulfs rate setting process, Rate Stabilization and Equalization (RSE), is subject to regulation by the APSC and is implemented pursuant to APSC orders expiring September 30, 2025. RSE adjustments would continue after that date unless the APSC enters an order to the contrary in a manner consistent with the law. Spire Mississippi is subject to regulation by the MSPSC and utilizes the Rate Stabilization Adjustment (RSA) Rider. For further details, see Note 15, Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nThe Utilities could incur additional costs if required to adjust to new laws or regulations, revisions to existing laws or regulations or changes in interpretations of existing laws or regulations. In addition, as the regulatory environment for the natural gas industry increases in complexity, the risk of inadvertent noncompliance could also increase. If the Utilities fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, whether existing or new, they could be subject to fines, penalties or other enforcement action by the authorities that regulate the Utilities operations.\nSignificantly warmer-than-normal weather conditions, the effects of climate change, legislative and regulatory initiatives in response to climate change or in support of increased energy efficiency, and other factors that influence customer usage may affect the Utilities sale of heating energy and adversely impact their financial position and results of operations.\nThe Utilities earnings are primarily generated by the sale of heating energy. Spire Missouri and Spire Mississippi each have a Weather Normalization Adjustment rider, Spire Alabama has a Temperature Adjustment Rider, and Spire Gulf has a Weather Impact Normalization Factor. These mechanisms, approved by the respective state regulatory body, provide better assurance of the recovery of fixed costs and margins during winter months despite variations in sales volumes due to the impacts of weather, while the annual rate designs of Alabama and Mississippi help adjust for other factors that affect customer usage. However, significantly warmer-than-normal weather conditions in the Utilities service areas and other factors, such as climate change, alternative energy sources and increased efficiency of gas furnaces and other appliances, may result in reduced profitability and decreased cash flows attributable to lower gas sales. Furthermore, continuation of these adjustment factors is subject to regulatory discretion.\nIn addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives by the federal, state and local governments addressing greenhouse gas emissions or restricting the use of natural gas could adversely affect customer demand. The promulgation of regulations of the emissions of greenhouse gases and efficiency for residential gas furnaces and other gas appliances or the potential enactment of congressional legislation addressing global warming and climate change may decrease customer usage, encourage fuel switching from gas to other energy forms, and may result in future additional compliance costs that could impact the Utilities financial conditions and results of operations.\nThe Utilities ability to meet their customers natural gas requirements may be impaired if contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline and/or storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner.\nIn order to meet their customers annual and seasonal natural gas demands, the Utilities must obtain sufficient supplies, interstate pipeline capacity, and storage capacity. If they are unable to obtain these, either from their suppliers inability to deliver the contracted commodity or the inability to secure replacement quantities, to the extent not mitigated by tariffs, contractual indemnification or insurance, the Utilities financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. If a substantial disruption in interstate natural gas pipelines transmission and storage capacity were to occur during periods of heavy demand, the Utilities financial results could be adversely impacted.\nIn particular, the natural gas supply provided to Spire Missouri by Spire STL Pipeline is at risk due to the order issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacating the Spire STL Pipelines Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity previously issued by the FERC and remanding the matter back to the FERC for further action. The STL Pipeline is currently operating under temporary certificates. In the event this pipeline is taken out of service, either temporarily or permanently, Spire Missouris ability to secure new pipeline contracts on other systems serving the region may be significantly constrained, and Spire Missouri would not be able to replace that supply based on similar terms or at all over the short term based on current market and operating conditions. In the event that the Spire STL Pipeline is unavailable and an extreme weather event occurs, Spire Missouri would face heightened risks, including service outages and other disruptions; the need for service restoration, creating hazards for Spire Missouri, its employees, and its customers; the potential for loss of life and property in its service territory; and associated exposure to litigation or administrative proceedings. If this pipeline is taken out of service, Spire Missouri may need to design, construct, and place in service new facilities or modify existing facilities in order to receive gas from alternate sources, giving rise to additional regulatory and business risks and hazards.\nSpire Missouri will continue to pursue all legal and regulatory avenues to ensure access to reliable, affordable and safe delivery of energy for eastern Missouri. If Spire Missouri is unable to obtain sufficient pipeline capacity to meet its customers annual and seasonal natural gas demands, Spire Missouris financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted which could result in a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Utilities are involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies that could adversely affect their results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Utilities are involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies with respect to general claims, rates, environmental issues, gas cost prudence reviews and other matters. For further details, see Contingencies in Note 16 to the financial statements in Item 8. Adverse decisions regarding these matters, to the extent they require the Utilities to make payments in excess of amounts provided for in their financial statements, or to the extent they are not covered by insurance, could adversely affect the Utilities results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Utilities liquidity may be adversely affected by delays in recovery of their costs, due to regulation.\nIn the normal course of business, there is a lag between when the Utilities incur increases in certain of their costs and the time in which those costs are considered for recovery in the ratemaking process. Cash requirements for increased operating costs, increased funding levels of defined benefit pension and postretirement costs, capital expenditures, and other increases in the costs of doing business can require outlays of cash prior to the authorization of increases in rates charged to customers, as approved by the MoPSC, APSC, and MSPSC. Accordingly, the Utilities liquidity can be adversely impacted to the extent higher costs are not timely recovered from their customers.\nThe Utilities liquidity and, in certain circumstances, the Utilities results of operations may be adversely affected by the cost of purchasing natural gas during periods in which natural gas prices are rising significantly.\nThe tariff rate schedules of Spire Missouri, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi contain Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clauses and Spire Alabamas tariff rate schedule contains a Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) rider that permit the Utilities to file for rate adjustments to recover the cost of purchased gas. Changes in the cost of purchased gas are flowed through to customers and may affect uncollectible amounts and cash flows and can therefore impact the amount of capital resources.\nCurrently, Spire Missouri is allowed to adjust the gas cost component of rates up to four times each year while Spire Alabama and Spire Gulf (collectively, the Alabama Utilities) and Spire Mississippi may adjust the gas cost component of their rates on a monthly basis. Spire Missouri must make a mandatory gas cost adjustment at the beginning of the winter, in November, and during the next twelve months may make up to three additional discretionary gas cost adjustments, so long as each of these adjustments is separated by at least two months.\nThe MoPSC typically approves the Spire Missouri PGA changes on an interim basis, subject to refund and the outcome of a subsequent audit and prudence review. Due to such review process, there is a risk of a disallowance of full recovery of these costs. Any material disallowance of purchased gas costs would adversely affect results of operations. The Alabama Utilities gas supply charges are submitted for APSC review on a monthly basis, regardless of whether there is a request for a change, so prudence review occurs on an ongoing basis. Spire Mississippis PGA is adjusted on a monthly basis for the most recent charges and is filed at the MSPSC on a monthly basis.\nIncreases in the prices the Utilities charge for gas may also adversely affect revenues because they could lead customers to reduce usage and cause some customers to have trouble paying the resulting higher bills. These higher prices may increase bad debt expenses and ultimately reduce earnings. Rapid increases in the price of purchased gas may result in an increase in short-term debt.\nTo lower financial exposure to commodity price fluctuations, Spire Missouri enters into contracts to hedge the forward commodity price of its natural gas supplies. As part of this strategy, Spire Missouri may use fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts, swaps, futures, and option contracts. However, Spire Missouri does not hedge the entire exposure of energy assets or positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. Any costs, gains, or losses experienced through hedging procedures, including carrying costs, generally flow through the PGA clause, thereby limiting Spire Missouris exposure to earnings volatility. However, variations in the timing of collections of such gas costs under the PGA clause and the effect of cash payments for margin deposits associated with Spire Missouris use of natural gas derivative instruments may cause short-term cash requirements to vary. These procedures remain subject to prudence review by the MoPSC.\nOther than fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts, Spire Alabama, Spire Gulf, and Spire Mississippi currently do not utilize risk mitigation strategies that incorporate commodity hedge instruments, but Spire Alabama has the ability to do so through its GSA.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may require significant expenditures or increase operating costs.\nThe Utilities are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of their present and future operations. These laws and regulations require the Utilities to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections, and approvals. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations and failure to obtain any required permits and licenses may result in costs to the Utilities in the form of fines, penalties or business interruptions, which may be material. In addition, existing environmental laws and regulations could be revised or reinterpreted and/or new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to the Utilities or their facilities, thereby impacting the Utilities cost of compliance. The discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions, including former manufactured gas plant sites, and claims against the Utilities under environmental laws and regulations may result in expenditures and liabilities, which could be material. To the extent environmental compliance costs are not fully covered by insurance or recovered in rates from customers, those costs may have an adverse effect on the Utilities financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Utilities business activities are concentrated in three states.\nThe Utilities provide natural gas distribution services to customers in Alabama, Mississippi, and Missouri. Changes in the regional economies, politics, regulations and weather patterns of these states could negatively impact the Utilities growth opportunities and the usage patterns and financial condition of customers and could adversely affect the Utilities earnings, cash flows, and financial position.\nThe Utilities may be adversely affected by economic conditions.\nPeriods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased energy consumption, particularly by industrial and large commercial companies, a loss of existing customers, and fewer new customers especially in newly constructed buildings. As a consequence, national or regional recessions or other downturns in economic activity could adversely affect the Utilities revenues and cash flows or restrict their future growth. Economic conditions in the Utilities service territories may also adversely impact the Utilities ability to collect accounts receivable, resulting in an increase in bad debt expense.\nBecause of competition, the Utilities may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers, which could have an adverse impact on their business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Utilities face the risk that larger commercial or industrial customers may bypass gas distribution services by gaining distribution directly from interstate pipelines or, in the case of Spire Alabama and Spire Gulf, also from municipally or publicly owned gas distributors located adjacent to its service territory. The Utilities cannot provide any assurance that increased competition will not have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Utilities compete with distributors offering a broad range of services and prices, from full-service distributors to those offering delivery only. The Utilities also compete for retail customers with suppliers of alternative energy products, principally propane and electricity, and to a growing extent, distributed sources of renewable energy. If they are unable to compete effectively, the Utilities may lose existing customers and/or fail to acquire new customers, which in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on their business, results of operations and financial condition. Along those lines, changes in wholesale natural gas prices compared with prices for electricity, fuel oil, coal, propane, or other energy sources can significantly impact the cost of delivered natural gas, which may affect the Utilities retention of natural gas customers and may adversely impact their financial condition and results of operations.\nRegional supply/demand fluctuations and changes in national infrastructure, as well as regulatory discretion, may adversely affect the Utilities ability to profit from off-system sales and capacity release.\nSpire Missouris and Spire Alabamas income from off-system sales and capacity release is subject to fluctuations in market conditions and changing supply and demand conditions in areas the Utilities hold pipeline capacity rights. Specific factors impacting the Utilities income from off-system sales and capacity release include the availability of attractively priced natural gas supply, availability of pipeline capacity, and market demand. Income from off-system sales and capacity release is shared with customers. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama are allowed to retain 25% of the net margins achieved as a result of such off-system sales and capacity release. The Utilities ability to retain such income in the future is subject to regulatory discretion. In fact, as of April 2022, Spire Alabama can only retain the 25% of capacity release after the first $1.6 million goes entirely to customers (while sharing remains immediate for off-system sales).\nRISKS THAT RELATE TO THE GAS MARKETING SEGMENT\nIncreased competition, fluctuations in natural gas commodity prices, expiration of supply and transportation arrangements, and infrastructure projects may adversely impact the future profitability of Gas Marketing.\nCompetition in the marketplace and fluctuations in natural gas commodity prices have a direct impact on the Gas Marketing business. Changing market conditions and prices, the narrowing of regional and seasonal price differentials and limited future price volatility may adversely impact its sales margins or affect its ability to procure gas supplies and/or to serve certain customers, which may reduce sales profitability and/or increase certain credit requirements caused by reductions in netting capability. Also, Gas Marketing profitability may be impacted by the effects of the expiration, in the normal course of business, of certain of its natural gas supply contracts if those contracts cannot be replaced and/or renewed with arrangements with similar terms and pricing. Although the FERC regulates the interstate transportation of natural gas and establishes the general terms and conditions under which Spire Marketing may use interstate gas pipeline capacity to purchase and transport natural gas, Spire Marketing must occasionally renegotiate its transportation agreements with a concentrated group of pipeline companies. Renegotiated terms of new agreements, or increases in FERC-authorized rates of existing agreements, may impact Gas Marketings future profitability. Profitability may also be adversely impacted if pipeline capacity or future storage capacity secured is not fully utilized.\nReduced access to credit and/or capital markets may prevent the Gas Marketing business from executing operating strategies.\nThe Gas Marketing segment relies on its cash flows, ability to effect net settlements with counterparties, parental guaranties, and access to Spires liquidity resources to satisfy its credit and working capital requirements. Spire Marketings ability to rely on parental guaranties is dependent upon Spires financial condition and credit ratings. If Spires credit ratings were lowered, particularly below investment grade, counterparty acceptance of parental guaranties may diminish, resulting in decreased availability of credit. Additionally, under such circumstances, certain counterparties may require Spire Marketing to provide prepayments or cash deposits, amounts of which would be dependent upon natural gas market conditions. Reduced access to credit or increased credit requirements, which may also be caused by factors such as higher overall natural gas prices, may limit Spire Marketings ability to enter into certain transactions. In addition, Spire Marketing has concentrations of counterparty credit risk in that a significant portion of its transactions are with (or are associated with) energy producers, utility companies, and pipelines. These concentrations of counterparties have the potential to affect the Companys overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that each of these three groups may be affected similarly by changes in economic, industry, or other conditions. Spire Marketing also has concentrations of credit risk in certain individually significant counterparties. Spire Marketing closely monitors its credit exposure and, although uncollectible amounts have not been significant, increased counterparty defaults are possible and may result in financial losses and/or capital limitations.\nRisk management policies, including the use of derivative instruments, may not fully protect Spire Marketings sales and results of operations from volatility and may result in financial losses.\nIn the course of its business, Spire Marketing enters into contracts to purchase and sell natural gas at fixed prices and index-based prices. Commodity price risk associated with these contracts has the potential to impact earnings and cash flows. To minimize this risk, Spire Marketing has a risk management policy that provides for daily monitoring of a number of business measures, including fixed price commitments.\nSpire Marketing currently manages the commodity price risk associated with fixed-price commitments for the purchase or sale of natural gas by either closely matching the offsetting physical purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed prices or through the use of natural gas futures, options, and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. and/or the Intercontinental Exchange to lock in margins. These exchange-traded/cleared contracts may be designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions. However, market conditions and regional price changes may cause ineffective portions of matched positions to result in financial losses. Additionally, to the extent that Spire Marketings natural gas contracts are classified as trading activities or do not otherwise qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales designation (or the designation is not elected), the contracts are recorded as derivatives at fair value each period. Accordingly, the associated gains and losses are reported directly in earnings and may cause volatility in results of operations. Gains or losses (realized and unrealized) on certain wholesale purchase and sale contracts, consisting of those classified as trading activities, are required to be presented on a net basis (instead of a gross basis) in the statements of consolidated income. Such presentation could result in volatility in the Companys operating revenues.\nAs a natural gas market participant, Spire Marketing is subject to applicable FERC- and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, including those directed generally to prevent manipulation of or fraud involving natural gas physical transactions and financial instruments, such as futures, options and swaps. Spire Marketing could be subject to substantial penalties and fines by the FERC or CFTC, or both, for failure to comply with such rules.\nSpire Marketings ability to meet its customers natural gas requirements may be impaired if contracted gas supplies and interstate pipeline services are not available or delivered in a timely manner.\nSpire Marketings ability to deliver natural gas to its customers is contingent upon the ability of natural gas producers, other gas marketers, and interstate pipelines to fulfill delivery obligations to Spire Marketing under firm contracts. To the extent that it is unable to obtain the necessary supplies, Spire Marketings financial position and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nRegulatory and legislative developments pertaining to the energy industry may adversely impact Gas Marketings results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Gas Marketing business is non-regulated, in that the rates it charges its customers are not currently established by or subject to approval by any regulatory body with jurisdiction over its business. However, it is subject to various laws and regulations affecting the energy industry. New regulatory and legislative actions may adversely impact Gas Marketings results of operations and financial condition by potentially reducing customer growth opportunities and/or increasing the costs of doing business.\nGas Marketing uses bilateral contracts and derivative instruments such as futures contracts, options and swaps to hedge or mitigate ongoing commercial risks. Most standardized swaps, under the Dodd-Frank Act, are required to be cleared through a registered clearing facility and traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the CFTCs rules require companies, including Spire Marketing, to maintain regulatory records of swap transactions, and to report swaps to centralized swap data repositories, among other compliance obligations. Although Spire Marketing may qualify for exceptions to certain of these CFTC rules, its derivatives counterparties are subject to capital, margin, documentation and business conduct requirements imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act. These obligations may increase transaction costs and may make it more difficult for Spire Marketing to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms or affect the number and/or creditworthiness of available swap counterparties. Spire Marketings inability to enter into derivatives instruments or other commercial risk hedging transactions on favorable terms, or at all, could increase operating expenses and expose it to unhedged commercial risks, including potential adverse changes in commodity prices.\nIn October 2020, the CFTC finalized its rules that modify and expand the applicability of speculative position limits on the amounts of certain futures contracts (including options thereon), cash-settled lookalike contracts for or linked to the commodities underlying the foregoing futures contracts, as well as economically equivalent swaps containing identical material contractual specifications, terms and conditions as the foregoing contracts. While Spire Marketing anticipates qualifying for a bona fide hedging exemption from such limits, the CFTCs final rules and earlier adopted aggregation rules may cause Spire Marketings hedging strategies described above to be limited if Spire Marketing is unable to qualify for an exemption.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nUnexpected losses may adversely affect Spires or its subsidiaries financial condition and results of operations.\nAs with most businesses, there are operations and business risks inherent in the activities of Spires subsidiaries. If, in the normal course of business, Spire or any of its subsidiaries becomes a party to litigation, such litigation could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, or penalties or be resolved on unfavorable terms. In accordance with customary practice, Spire and its subsidiaries maintain insurance against a significant portion of, but not all, risks and losses. In addition, in the normal course of its operations, Spire and its subsidiaries may be exposed to loss from other sources, such as bad debt expense or the failure of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations. Spire and its operating companies employ many strategies to gain assurance that such risks are appropriately managed, mitigated, or insured, as appropriate. To the extent a loss is not fully covered by insurance or other risk mitigation strategies, that loss could adversely affect the Companys and/or its subsidiaries financial condition and results of operations.\nCatastrophic events may adversely affect the Companys facilities and operations.\nCatastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, tropical storms, winter storms, terrorist acts, acts of civil unrest, pandemic illnesses or other similar occurrences could adversely affect the Utilities facilities and operations, as well as those of Spire STL Pipeline and Spire Storage. The Utilities have emergency planning and training programs in place to respond to events that could cause business interruptions. However, unanticipated events or a combination of events, failure in resources needed to respond to events, or slow or inadequate response to events may have an adverse impact on the operations, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. To the extent the impacts of such catastrophic events are not covered by insurance or recovered in rates, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased dependence on technology may hinder Spires and its subsidiaries business operations and adversely affect their financial condition and results of operations if such technologies fail.\nSpire and its subsidiaries have implemented or acquired a variety of technological tools including both Company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties. These tools and systems support critical functions including Spire and its subsidiaries integrated planning, scheduling and dispatching of field resources, its automated meter reading system, customer care and billing, procurement and accounts payable, operational plant logistics, management reporting, and external financial reporting. The failure of these or other similarly important technologies, or the Companys or its subsidiaries inability to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder their business operations and, to the extent not covered by insurance, could adversely impact their financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough the Company and its subsidiaries have, when possible, developed alternative sources of technology and built redundancy into their computer networks and tools, there can be no assurance that these efforts to date would protect against all potential issues related to the loss of any such technologies or the Utilities use of such technologies.\nA cyberattack may disrupt Spires operations or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information or potential liability.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to cybersecurity risks primarily related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive customer, employee, and vendor information maintained by the Company, its subsidiaries, or its third-party vendors in the normal course of business, as well as breaches in the technology that manages natural gas distribution operations and other business processes. A loss of confidential or proprietary data or security breaches of technology for operations or business processes could adversely affect the Companys and its subsidiaries reputation, diminish customer confidence, disrupt operations, and subject the Company and its subsidiaries to possible financial liability, any of which could have a material effect on the Companys and its subsidiaries financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company acknowledges that increased dependence on technology increases the Companys exposure to cyberattack. The Company and its subsidiaries closely monitor both preventive and detective measures to manage these risks and maintain cyber risk insurance to mitigate a significant portion, but not all, of these risks and losses. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these cyber events is not covered by insurance, it could adversely affect the Companys and its subsidiaries financial condition and results of operations.\nWorkforce risks may affect the Companys financial results.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various workforce risks, including, but not limited to, the risk that it will be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel; that it will be unable to effectively transfer to new personnel the knowledge and expertise of an aging workforce as those workers retire; and that it will be unable to reach collective bargaining arrangements with the unions that represent certain of its workers, which could result in work stoppages.\nResources expended to pursue or integrate business acquisitions, investments or other business arrangements may adversely affect Spires financial position and results of operations and return on investments made may not meet the Companys expectations.\nFrom time to time, Spire may seek to grow through strategic acquisitions, investments or other business arrangements. Attractive acquisition and investment opportunities may be difficult to complete on economically acceptable terms. It is possible for Spire to expend considerable resources pursuing acquisitions and investments but, for a variety of reasons, decide not to move forward. Similarly, investment opportunities may be hindered or halted by regulatory or legal actions. To the extent that acquisitions or investments are made, such transactions involve a number of risks, including but not limited to, the assumption of material liabilities, the diversion of managements attention from daily operations, difficulties in assimilation and retention of employees, securing adequate capital to support the transaction, and regulatory approval. Uncertainties exist in assessing the value, risks, profitability, and liabilities associated with certain businesses or assets and there is a possibility that anticipated operating and financial efficiencies expected to result from an acquisition or investment do not develop. Additionally, there are no assurances that resources expended will achieve their intended result.\nThe failure to complete an acquisition successfully or to integrate acquisitions or investments it may undertake could have an adverse effect on the Spires financial condition and results of operations and the markets perception of the Companys execution of its strategy. To the extent Spire engages in any of the above activities together with or through one or more of its subsidiaries, including the Utilities, such subsidiaries may face the same risks.\nChanges in accounting standards may adversely impact the Companys financial condition and results of operations.\nSpire and its subsidiaries are subject to changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), SEC regulations and other interpretations of financial reporting requirements for public utilities. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries have any control over the impact these changes may have on their financial condition or results of operations nor the timing of such changes. The potential issues associated with rate-regulated accounting, along with other potential changes to GAAP that the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) continues to consider may be significant. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone. Item 2. Properties\nSpire\nRefer to the information below about the principal properties of Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama. The Spire EnergySouth utilities own more than 5,000 miles of pipelines. Other properties of Spire and its subsidiaries do not constitute a significant portion of its properties. The current leases for office space in downtown St. Louis commenced in early 2015, with terms ranging from 10 to 20 years, with multiple renewal options. For further information on leases see Note 17, Leases, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nSpire Missouri\nThe principal properties of Spire Missouri consist of its gas distribution system, which includes more than 31,000 miles of main and related service lines, odorization and regulation facilities, and customer meters. The mains and service lines are located in municipal streets or alleys, public streets or highways, or on lands of others for which Spire Missouri has obtained the necessary legal rights to place and operate its facilities on such property. Spire Missouri has an underground natural gas storage facility, several operating centers, and other related properties. Substantially all of Spire Missouris utility plant is subject to the liens of its mortgage. All the properties of Spire Missouri are held in fee, by easement, or under lease agreements.\nSpire Alabama\nThe properties of Spire Alabama consist primarily of its gas distribution system, which includes more than 24,000 miles of main and related service lines, odorization and regulation facilities, and customer meters. The mains and service lines are located in municipal streets or alleys, public streets or highways, or on lands of others for which Spire Alabama has obtained the necessary legal rights to place and operate its facilities on such property. Spire Alabama also has four LNG facilities, several operating centers, and other related properties. All of the properties of Spire Alabama are held in fee, by easement, or under lease agreements.

Item 6. (Reserved) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Dollars in millions, except per share and per unit amounts)\nINTRODUCTION\nThis section analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of Spire Inc. (the Company), Spire Missouri Inc., and Spire Alabama Inc. Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and Spire EnergySouth are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and the subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth are collectively referred to as the Utilities. The subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth are Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi. This section includes managements view of factors that affect the respective businesses of the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, explanations of financial results including changes in earnings and costs from the prior periods, and the effects of such factors on the Companys, Spire Missouris and Spire Alabamas overall financial condition and liquidity. Unless otherwise indicated, references to years herein are references to the fiscal years ending September 30 for the Company and its subsidiaries.\nReference is made to Item 1A. Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements, which describe important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and non-historical information contained herein. In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes thereto of Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company has two reportable segments: Gas Utility and Gas Marketing. Nearly all of Spires earnings are derived from its Gas Utility segment, which reflects the regulated activities of the Utilities. Due to the seasonal nature of the Utilities business and the volumetric Spire Missouri rate design, earnings of Spire and each of the Utilities are typically concentrated during the heating season of November through April each fiscal year.\nGas Utility - Spire Missouri\nSpire Missouri is Missouris largest natural gas distribution utility and is regulated by the MoPSC. Spire Missouri serves St. Louis, Kansas City, and other areas throughout the state. Spire Missouri purchases natural gas in the wholesale market from producers and marketers and ships the gas through interstate pipelines into its own distribution facilities for sale to residential, commercial and industrial customers. Spire Missouri also transports gas through its distribution system for certain larger customers who buy their own gas on the wholesale market. Spire Missouri delivers natural gas to customers at rates and in accordance with tariffs authorized by the MoPSC. The earnings of Spire Missouri are primarily generated by the sale of heating energy.\nGas Utility - Spire Alabama\nSpire Alabama is the largest natural gas distribution utility in the state of Alabama and is regulated by the APSC. Spire Alabamas service territory is located in central and northern Alabama. Among the cities served by Spire Alabama are Birmingham, the center of the largest metropolitan area in the state, and Montgomery, the state capital. Spire Alabama purchases natural gas through interstate and intrastate suppliers and distributes the purchased gas through its distribution facilities for sale to residential, commercial, and industrial customers and other end-users of natural gas. Spire Alabama also transports gas through its distribution system for certain large commercial and industrial customers for a transportation fee. Effective December 1, 2020, for most of these transportation service customers, Spire Alabama also purchases gas on the wholesale market for sale to the customer upon delivery to the Spire Alabama distribution system. All Spire Alabama services are provided to customers at rates and in accordance with tariffs authorized by the APSC.\nGas Utility - Spire EnergySouth\nSpire Gulf and Spire Mississippi are utilities engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 100,000 customers in southern Alabama and south-central Mississippi. Spire Gulf is regulated by the APSC, and Spire Mississippi is regulated by the MSPSC.\nGas Marketing\nSpire Marketing is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and related activities on a non-regulated basis and is reported in the Gas Marketing segment. Spire Marketing markets natural gas to customers across the U.S. (and into Canada), including customers inside and outside of the Utilities service areas. It holds firm transportation and storage contracts in order to effectively manage its transactions with counterparties, which primarily include producers, municipalities, electric and gas utility companies, and large commercial and industrial customers.\nOther\nOther components of the Companys consolidated information include:\nSpire STL Pipeline, a subsidiary of Spire providing interstate natural gas pipeline transportation services;\nSpire Storage, a subsidiary of Spire providing interstate natural gas storage services;\nSpires subsidiaries engaged in the operation of a propane pipeline and risk management, among other activities; and\nunallocated corporate items, including certain debt and associated interest costs.\nBusiness Evaluation Factors\nBased on the nature of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as current economic conditions, management focuses on several key variables in evaluating the financial condition and results of operations and managing the business.\nFor the Gas Utility segment, these include:\nthe Utilities ability to recover from their customers the costs of purchasing and distributing natural gas;\nthe impact of weather and other factors, such as customer conservation, on revenues and expenses;\nchanges in the regulatory environment at the federal, state, and local levels, as well as decisions by regulators, that impact the Utilities ability to earn the authorized rate of return and recover prudent costs in each of the service territories they serve;\nthe Utilities ability to access credit markets and maintain working capital sufficient to meet operating requirements;\nthe effect of natural gas price volatility on the business; and\nthe ability to manage costs, integrate and standardize operations, and upgrade infrastructure.\nIn the Gas Marketing segment, these include:\nthe risks of competition;\nfluctuations and volatility in natural gas prices;\nthe changing flow and availability of natural gas;\nnew national infrastructure projects;\nthe ability to procure firm transportation and storage services at reasonable rates;\ncredit and/or capital market access; and\ncounterparty risks.\nFurther information regarding how management seeks to manage these key variables is discussed below.\nGas Utility\nThe Utilities seek to provide reliable natural gas services at a reasonable cost, while maintaining and building secure and dependable infrastructures. The Utilities strategies focus on improving both performance and the ability to recover their authorized distribution costs and rates of return. The Utilities distribution costs are the essential, primarily fixed, expenditures they must incur to operate and maintain more than 60,000 miles of mains and services comprising their natural gas distribution systems and related storage facilities.\nThe Utilities distribution costs include wages and employee benefit costs, depreciation and maintenance expenses, and other regulated utility operating expenses, excluding natural and propane gas expense. Distribution costs are considered in the rate-making process, and recovery of these types of costs is included in revenues generated through the Utilities tariff rates. Spire Missouris tariff rates are approved by the MoPSC, whereas Spire Alabamas tariff rates are approved by the APSC. Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi have tariff rates that are approved by the APSC and MSPSC, respectively.\nSpire Missouri and Spire Alabama also have off-system sales and capacity release income streams that are regulated by tariff but remain subject to fluctuations in market conditions. Some of the factors impacting the level of off-system sales include the availability and cost of Spires natural gas supply, the weather in its service areas and the weather in other markets. When Spires service areas experience warmer-than-normal weather while other markets experience colder weather or supply constraints, some of Spires natural gas supply is available for sale to third parties not on Spires system.\nThe Utilities work actively to reduce the impact of wholesale natural gas price volatility on their costs by strategically structuring their natural gas supply portfolios to increase their gas supply availability and pricing alternatives. They may also use derivative instruments to hedge against significant changes in the commodity price of natural gas. Nevertheless, the overall cost of purchased gas remains subject to fluctuations in market conditions. The Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clause of Spire Missouri, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi and the Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) rider of Spire Alabama allow the Utilities to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the public service commissions, the cost of purchased gas supplies, including costs, cost reductions and related carrying costs associated with the use of derivative instruments to mitigate volatility in the cost of natural gas. As of September 30, 2022, Spire Missouri had active derivative positions, but Spire Alabama has had no gas supply derivative instrument activity since 2010. Except in certain situations discussed under the caption -The Utilities ability to meet their customers natural gas requirements may be impaired if contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline and/or storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner under Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in Note 15, Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8, the Utilities believe they will continue to be able to obtain sufficient gas supply. The price of natural gas supplies and other economic conditions may affect sales volumes, due to the conservation efforts of customers, and cash flows associated with the timing of collection of gas costs and related accounts receivable from customers.\nThe Utilities rely on short-term credit and long-term capital markets, as well as cash flows from operations, to satisfy their seasonal cash requirements and fund their capital expenditures. The Utilities access the commercial paper market through a program administered by the holding company, which then loans borrowed funds to the Utilities. The Utilities directly access the long-term bond market. Access to debt markets is dependent on current conditions in the credit and capital markets. Management focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet and believes the Utilities currently have adequate access to credit and capital markets and will have sufficient capital resources to meet their foreseeable obligations. See the Capital Resources section for additional information.\nGas Marketing\nSpire Marketing utilizes its natural gas supply agreements, transportation agreements, park and loan agreements, storage agreements and other executory contracts to support a variety of services to its customers at competitive prices. It closely monitors and manages the natural gas commodity price and volatility risks associated with providing such services to its customers through the use of a variety of risk management activities, including the use of exchange-traded/cleared derivative instruments and other contractual arrangements. Spire Marketing is committed to managing commodity price risk while it seeks to expand the services that it now provides. Nevertheless, income from the Gas Marketing operations is subject to more fluctuations in market conditions than the Utilities operations.\nThe Gas Marketing business is directly impacted by the effects of competition in the marketplace, the impacts of new infrastructure, surplus natural gas supplies, and the addition of new demand from exports, power generation and industrial load. Spire Marketings management expects a growing need for marketing services across the country as customers manage seasonal variability and marketplace volatility.\nIn addition to its own operating cash flows, Spire Marketing relies on Spires parental guaranties to secure its purchase and sales obligations of natural gas, and it also has access to Spires liquidity resources. A large portion of Spire Marketings receivables are from customers in the energy industry. It also enters into netting arrangements with many of its energy counterparties to reduce overall credit and collateral exposure. On a net dollar exposure basis, the majority of Spire Marketings customers are utilities or utility affiliates. Although Spire Marketings uncollectible amounts are closely monitored and have not been significant, increases in uncollectible amounts from customers are possible and could adversely affect Spire Marketings liquidity and results of operations.\nSpire Marketing carefully monitors the creditworthiness of counterparties to its transactions. It performs in-house credit reviews of potential customers and may require credit assurances such as prepayments, letters of credit or parental guaranties when appropriate. Credit limits for customers are established and monitored.\nSpire Marketing cannot be certain that all of its wholesale purchase and sale transactions will settle physically. As such, these transactions are designated as trading activities for financial reporting purposes, due to their settlement characteristics. Results of operations from trading activities are reported on a net basis in natural gas expenses.\nIn the course of its business, Spire Marketing enters into commitments associated with the purchase or sale of natural gas. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, some of its purchase and sale transactions are not recognized in earnings until the natural gas is physically delivered, while other energy-related transactions, including those designated as trading activities, are required to be accounted for as derivatives with the changes in their fair value (representing unrealized gains or losses) recorded in earnings in periods prior to settlement. Because related transactions of a purchase and sale strategy may be accounted for differently, there may be timing differences in the recognition of earnings under GAAP and economic earnings realized upon settlement. The Company reports both GAAP and net economic earnings (non-GAAP), as discussed in the section Non-GAAP Measures.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nNet income, earnings per share and operating income reported by Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama are determined in accordance with GAAP. Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama also provide the non-GAAP financial measures of net economic earnings, net economic earnings per share and contribution margin. Management and the Board of Directors use non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting, to determine incentive compensation and to evaluate financial performance. These non-GAAP operating metrics should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, the related GAAP measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided on the following pages.\nNet Economic Earnings and Net Economic Earnings Per Share\nNet economic earnings and net economic earnings per share are non-GAAP measures that exclude from net income the impacts of fair value accounting and timing adjustments associated with energy-related transactions, the impacts of acquisition, divestiture and restructuring activities, and the largely non-cash impacts of impairments and other non-recurring or unusual items such as certain regulatory, legislative or GAAP standard-setting actions. In addition, net economic earnings per share would exclude the impact, in the fiscal year of issuance, of any shares issued to finance acquisitions that have yet to be included in net economic earnings.\nThe fair value and timing adjustments are made in instances where the accounting treatment differs from what management considers the economic substance of the underlying transaction, including the following:\nNet unrealized gains and losses on energy-related derivatives that are required by GAAP fair value accounting associated with current changes in the fair value of financial and physical transactions prior to their completion and settlement. These unrealized gains and losses result primarily from two sources:\n1)\nchanges in the fair values of physical and/or financial derivatives prior to the period of settlement; and\n2)\nineffective portions of accounting hedges, required to be recorded in earnings prior to settlement, due to differences in commodity price changes between the locations of the forecasted physical purchase or sale transactions and the locations of the underlying hedge instruments;\nLower of cost or market adjustments to the carrying value of commodity inventories resulting when the net realizable value of the commodity falls below its original cost, to the extent that those commodities are economically hedged; and\nRealized gains and losses resulting from the settlement of economic hedges prior to the sale of the physical commodity.\nThese adjustments eliminate the impact of timing differences and the impact of current changes in the fair value of financial and physical transactions prior to their completion and settlement. Unrealized gains or losses are recorded in each period until being replaced with the actual gains or losses realized when the associated physical transactions occur. Management believes that excluding the earnings volatility caused by recognizing changes in fair value prior to settlement and other timing differences associated with related purchase and sale transactions provides a useful representation of the economic effects of only the actual settled transactions and their effects on results of operations. While management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate all of its businesses, the net effect of these fair value and timing adjustments on the Utilities earnings is minimal because gains or losses on their natural gas derivative instruments are deferred pursuant to state regulation.\nContribution Margin\nIn addition to operating revenues and operating expenses, management also uses the non-GAAP measure of contribution margin when evaluating results of operations. Contribution margin is defined as operating revenues less natural gas costs and gross receipts tax expense. The Utilities pass to their customers (subject to prudence review by, as applicable, the MoPSC, APSC or MSPSC) increases and decreases in the wholesale cost of natural gas in accordance with their PGA clauses or GSA riders. The volatility of the wholesale natural gas market results in fluctuations from period to period in the recorded levels of, among other items, revenues and natural gas cost expense. Nevertheless, increases and decreases in the cost of gas associated with system gas sales volumes and gross receipts tax expense (which are calculated as a percentage of revenues), with the same amount (excluding immaterial timing differences) included in revenues, have no direct effect on operating income. Therefore, management believes that contribution margin is a useful supplemental measure, along with the remaining operating expenses, for assessing the Companys and the Utilities performance.\nEARNINGS\nThis section contains discussion and analysis of the results for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the results for the year ended September 30, 2021. The discussion and analysis of the results for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to the results of the year ended September 30, 2020 can be found in Part II, Item 7 of Spire Inc.s fiscal 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November 22, 2021.\nOverview\nThe past two years have offered numerous challenges. During severe winter weather in fiscal 2021, we were successful in providing safe, reliable service for our service areas in addition to driving value from investments in transportation and storage capacity we made at Spire Marketing. With regard to the Spire STL Pipeline, while operating under a temporary certificate, we continue to work with regulators and constituents regarding obtaining a permanent certificate. As discussed in Note 15, Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8, we also received an order in our 2021 Missouri rate review which was inconsistent with precedent established by the MoPSC in prior rate cases.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Company continued the important work of upgrading our Utilities infrastructure to make our system safer, more reliable and environmentally sustainable. We also further deployed technology, including ultrasonic meters, to improve our service operations and deliver on improved experience for the homes and business we serve.\nOn the Gas Utility regulatory front, we continue to make progress. Spire Missouri filed a new general rate case on April 1, 2022, seeking full recovery of its updated cost of service, deferred overhead costs, and increased capital investment, as well as a fair and reasonable rate of return. The filing requested a $152 million revenue increase, reflecting a $3.4 billion rate base and a rate of return based on a requested return on equity of 10.5% and a 55% equity capitalization. After local public hearings were completed, the parties reached a Full Unanimous Stipulation and Agreement to resolve all issues in the case which was filed with the MoPSC on November 4, 2022. A hearing regarding this stipulation is currently set for November 18.\nThis fiscal year also saw progress in Spire's midstream operations. Spire Storage received FERC approval to expand capacity and increase pipeline connectivity at certain of Spire Storages natural gas storage facilities in Wyoming. On August 26, 2022, the Company announced that capital expenditures in support of this project will total $195.0 through fiscal years 2023 into 2025.\nThe following sections present and discuss the financial metrics in total and by registrant and segment.\nSpire\nThe following tables reconcile the Companys net economic earnings to the most comparable GAAP number, net

Short-term rates averaged 1.1% in fiscal 2022 compared to 0.4% for fiscal 2021.\nThe reduction in income taxes was primarily attributable to the lower pre-tax book income in 2022, partly offset by a $4.1 charge resulting from Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) reconciliations from the 2021 Missouri rate order that was issued late in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nGas Utility\nThe $38.6 decrease in Gas Utility net income primarily reflects decreases of $29.2 and $5.3 at Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively, while the $27.9 decrease in net economic earnings for the segment reflects decreases of $18.5 and $5.3 at Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively. These results are described in further detail below.\nThe decrease in Gas Utility operating revenues for fiscal 2022 was attributable to the following factors:\nSpire Missouri - Fiscal 2021 OFO charges\n$ (195.8 )\nSpire Missouri - Off-system sales and capacity release\n(120.1 )\nSpire Missouri and Spire Alabama - Volumetric usage (net of weather mitigation)\n(9.9 )\nSpire Missouri and Spire Alabama - Higher PGA/GSA gas cost recoveries\n99.9\nSpire Missouri - 2021 rate order effects\n18.1\nSpire Missouri and Spire Alabama - Higher gross receipts taxes\n15.7\nSpire Alabama - Off-system sales and capacity release\n9.8\nSpire Alabama - RSE: net adjustments\n4.3\nAll other factors\n4.8\nTotal Variation\n$ (173.2 )\nThe decrease in revenues was driven primarily by a $199.8 decrease in Spire Missouri gas costs (including $195.8 of cover charges and OFO penalties to certain wholesale customers in the prior year), a $120.1 decrease in Spire Missouri off-system sales, and higher segment weather/volumetric impacts of $9.9. These negative impacts were partly offset by higher PGA/GSA gas cost recoveries of $99.9, an $18.1 increase in revenues as a result of the Spire Missouri 2021 rate order, higher segment gross receipts taxes of $15.7, a $9.8 increase in Spire Alabama off-system sales, and a $4.3 increase in revenues due to Spire Alabamas rate adjustments under the RSE mechanism.\nThe year-over-year decrease in Gas Utility contribution margin was attributable to the following factors:\nSpire Missouri - Off-system sales and capacity release\n$ (26.3 )\nSpire Missouri and Spire Alabama - Volumetric usage (net of weather mitigation)\n(9.2 )\nSpire Missouri - 2021 rate order effects\n18.1\nSpire Alabama - RSE: net adjustments\n3.8\nSpire Alabama - Off-system and capacity release\n1.5\nAll other factors\n(3.9 )\nTotal Variation\n$ (16.0 )\nThe contribution margin decrease resulted primarily from lower Missouri off-system sales, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama volumetric impacts of $9.2, partly offset by an $18.1 increase resulting from the 2021 Missouri rate order, Spire Alabama rate adjustments under the RSE mechanism, and higher volumetric margins. The lower off-system sales and volumetric impacts were primarily the result of the extreme weather conditions from Winter Storm Uri in February 2021.\nReported O&M expenses decreased $8.9. O&M decreased by $9.8 after excluding the impacts of the Non-service Cost Transfer of $4.4, the $9.0 attributable to the Missouri Supreme Court ruling that partially reversed 2018 rate order pension cost disallowances, and $3.7 due to one-time cost adjustments relating to stipulations settled in the 2021 Spire Missouri rate order. This decrease is due primarily to lower employee-related costs and lower bad debt expense. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended September 30, 2022 increased $24.2 from the prior year, principally the result of continued infrastructure capital spending, with $16.1 of the increase attributable to Spire Missouri and $4.7 attributable to Spire Alabama. Included in the Spire Missouri increase is a $3.4 charge pertaining to meter cost recovery that was disallowed by the MoPSC. Taxes, other than income taxes, increased $19.2, and were driven by the higher pass-through gross receipts taxes mentioned earlier, combined with higher property taxes resulting from the continued infrastructure build-out by the utilities.\nGas Marketing\nBoth net income and net economic earnings reflect the strong operating results in the prior year, driven by storage positions that resulted in optimization of market conditions in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to extreme weather as a result of Winter Storm Uri. Current year incremental optimization of storage and transportation assets in the Southeast during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022 and favorable fair value adjustments only partly offset the benefits from the extreme weather in the prior year.\nThe variance in revenues primarily reflects higher commodity pricing in fiscal 2022.\nGas Marketing contribution margin decreased $14.3 from the same period last year, driven principally by strong second quarter results in fiscal 2021. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the February cold weather events drove significantly higher regional basis differentials and volumes, which were only partly offset by favorable year-over-year fair value adjustments of $14.4 and incremental optimization of storage and transportation assets in the Southeast during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022.\nOther\nThe Companys other non-utility activities generated a $3.1 higher net loss for fiscal 2022. Included in those results were higher interest and corporate costs in the current year. Other operating revenue increased $1.5, driven principally by Spire STL Pipeline and Spire Storage. Other operating expenses were $3.1 lower than the prior year, primarily reflecting lower current year operating expenses at Spire Storage and STL Pipeline.\nSpire Missouri\nYear Ended September 30,\nOperating Income\n$ 204.0\n$ 228.6\nOperation and maintenance expenses\n255.7\n261.1\nDepreciation and amortization\n145.3\n129.2\nTaxes, other than income taxes\n129.0\n110.9\nLess: Gross receipts tax expense\n(79.6 )\n(64.3 )\nContribution Margin [Non-GAAP]\n654.4\n665.5\nNatural gas costs\n587.0\n786.8\nGross receipts tax expense\n79.6\n64.3\nOperating Revenues\n$ 1,321.0\n$ 1,516.6\nNet Income\n$ 114.9\n$ 144.1\nThe $195.6 decrease in operating revenues reflects a $120.1 decrease in 0ff-system sales and lower gas costs of $109.5 (as commodity cost recovery increases in the current year of $86.3 were more than offset by last year's $195.8 of cover charges and OFO penalties to certain wholesale customers). Partly offsetting these negative impacts were an $18.1 increase in operating revenues due to the 2021 Missouri rate order, a $15.3 increase in gross receipts taxes, and a $3.4 increase in volumetric impacts as underlying increases in economic activity more than offset the impact of warmer weather in the current year.\nTemperatures in Spire Missouris service areas during fiscal 2022 were 5.7% warmer than during fiscal 2021 and 9.5% warmer than normal. The Spire Missouri total system volume sold and transported was 1,602.8 million centum of cubic feet (CCF) for the year ended September 30, 2022, compared with 1,666.9 million CCF last year. Total off-system volume sold and transported was 19.1 million CCF for fiscal 2022, compared with 21.9 million for fiscal 2021.\nContribution margin decreased $11.1 from the prior year. The variance was attributable to a $26.3 decrease in off-system sales and $2.0 lower volumetric margins (both principally due to the extreme weather in February of the prior year), which were only partly offset by the previously mentioned $18.1 increase relating to the 2021 Missouri rate order.\nExcluding the Non-service Cost Transfer of $3.5, the Missouri Supreme Court ruling totaling $9.0 and the $3.7 due to one-time cost adjustments relating to stipulations settled in the 2021 Spire Missouri rate order discussed above, O&M expenses during the year ended September 30, 2022, decreased $7.2 from last year. The decrease in O&M was driven by lower employee-related costs. Depreciation increased by $16.1 as a result of continuing capital investment and a $3.4 charge pertaining to disallowed meter cost recovery by the MoPSC. Taxes, other than income taxes, increased $18.1, driven by the higher pass-through gross receipts taxes and higher property taxes resulting from the continued infrastructure build-out.\nSpire Missouris other expense was $2.0 lower, as the increase of $3.5 due primarily to the Non-service Cost Transfer expense and decreases in the fair value of investments associated with non-qualified employee benefit plans reflecting market conditions were more than offset by miscellaneous income. Interest expense increased $10.6, reflecting higher levels of long-term debt and higher short-term interest rates. Income tax expense for the current year was lower by $4.0, as the impact of lower pre-tax book income was partly offset by a $4.1 charge resulting from TCJA reconciliations from the 2021 Missouri rate order that was completed late in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nSpire Alabama\nYear Ended September 30,\nOperating Income\n$ 112.6\n$ 117.0\nOperation and maintenance expenses\n130.1\n132.5\nDepreciation and amortization\n66.8\n62.1\nTaxes, other than income taxes\n38.1\n37.1\nLess: Gross receipts tax expense\n(25.5 )\n(25.1 )\nContribution Margin [Non-GAAP]\n322.1\n323.6\nNatural gas costs\n161.5\n145.3\nGross receipts tax expense\n25.5\n25.1\nOperating Revenues\n$ 509.1\n$ 494.0\nNet Income\n$ 68.5\n$ 73.8\nThe $15.1 increase in operating revenues reflects a $13.6 increase in gas cost recoveries pursuant to the GSA mechanism, off-system sales in the current year contributing $9.8 to revenue growth, and $4.3 higher net rate adjustments under the RSE mechanism. These favorable impacts were partly offset by a $13.3 reduction attributable to weather/volumetric impacts that were impacted by weather mitigation.\nTemperatures in Spire Alabamas service area during fiscal 2022 were 4.1% warmer than during fiscal 2021 and 9.7% warmer than normal. Spire Alabamas total system volume sold and transported was 1,010.8 million CCF during the year ended September 30, 2022, compared with 1,009.4 million CCF during the prior year. Off-system sales volume for fiscal 2022 totaled 63.1 million CCF compared with 47.5 million CCF for fiscal 2021.\nContribution margin decreased $1.5, which was principally a result of unfavorable weather/volumetric impacts totaling $7.2. This negative impact was mostly offset by net favorable RSE adjustments of $3.8 and off-system sales contributing $1.5 in growth in fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of the Non-Service Cost Transfer of $0.9, the decrease in O&M of $1.5 was driven by lower operations and employee-related costs. Depreciation expense was up $4.7 reflecting the continued infrastructure investments being made in the territory.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nRecent Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$ 55.0\n$ 249.8\n$ 469.9\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(546.7 )\n(622.0 )\n(631.6 )\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n500.9\n379.4\n160.0\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $194.8 from 2021 to 2022 and decreased $220.1 from 2020 to 2021. In addition to the changes in net income between the respective periods (discussed above), the remaining changes were related to regulatory timing and fluctuations in working capital items, as discussed below in the Future Cash Requirements section. More specifically, when looking at the change from 2020 to 2021, the large increase in accounts receivable was due to the February 2021 cold weather event and the related delayed collections. In addition, this significant cold weather event impacted other areas, including increased inventories to ensure supply and increased accounts payable as related gas costs had risen. For more information, see the discussion of Spire Missouris Operational Flow Order in Note 15, Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nIn fiscal 2022, the Company's net cash used in investing activities was $75.3 less than in fiscal 2021, primarily driven by a $72.6 decrease in capital expenditures. The drivers of the lower capital expenditures were a $61.8 spending decline in the Utilities, a $8.1 decline for Spire Storage, and a slight decline at Spire STL Pipeline.\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company used $9.6 less cash in investing activities than in fiscal 2020, primarily driven by a $13.6 decrease in capital expenditures. The primary driver of the lower capital expenditures was a $53.3 decline related to Spire STL Pipeline and Spire Storage, largely offset by a $42.6 capital spending increase at Gas Utility, where the focus remained on infrastructure upgrades and new business development.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was up $121.5 in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Current year short-term debt, net issuances were $365.5, or $341.5 higher than in fiscal 2021. In addition, the combination of lower net repayments of long-term debt ($59.6) and higher cash generated from the issuance of common stock ($50.9) in fiscal 2022 contributed $110.5 to the year-over-year increase. A significant offset to these increases was a $329.1 decline in cash generated from the issuance of long-term debt, coupled with $8.7 higher common stock dividend payments.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was up $219.4 in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021, long-term debt issuances were $629.1, or $119.1 higher than in fiscal 2020, and the combination of lower net repayments of both long-term and short-term debt in fiscal 2021 contributed $150.8 to the year-over-year increase. Partially offsetting these increases was a $40.1 decline in cash generated from common stock issuances and $5.2 higher common stock dividend payments.\nFuture Cash Requirements\nThe Companys short-term borrowing requirements typically peak during colder months when the Utilities borrow money to cover the lag between when they purchase natural gas and when their customers pay for that gas. Changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas (including cash payments for margin deposits associated with Spire Missouris use of natural gas derivative instruments), variations in the timing of collections of gas cost under the Utilities PGA clauses and GSA riders, the seasonality of accounts receivable balances, and the utilization of storage gas inventories cause short-term cash requirements to vary during the year and from year to year, and may cause significant variations in the Companys cash provided by or used in operating activities.\nSpires material cash requirements as of September 30, 2022, are related to capital expenditures, principal and interest payments on long-term debt, natural gas purchase obligations, and dividends.\nTotal Company capital expenditures are planned to be $700 for fiscal 2023, though Spire had purchase commitments for only a small portion of these as of September 30, 2022.\nAs detailed in Note 6, Long-Term Debt, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8, $281.2 of the total $3,258.9 principal amount is due in fiscal 2023. Using each long-term debt instruments stated maturity and fixed rates or variable rates as of September 30, 2022, interest payments are projected to total $1,560.2, of which $116.2 is due in fiscal 2023.\nSpires natural gas purchase obligations totaled $2,107.1, including $946.8 for fiscal 2023, representing the minimum payments required under existing natural gas transportation and storage contracts and natural gas supply agreements. The amounts reflect fixed obligations as well as obligations to purchase natural gas at future market prices, calculated using forward market prices as of September 30, 2022. Each of the Utilities generally recovers costs related to its purchases, transportation and storage of natural gas through the operation of its PGA clause or GSA rider, subject to prudence review by the appropriate regional public service commission. Additional contractual commitments are generally entered into prior to or during the heating season.\nSpire dividends declared and payable as of September 30, 2022, totaled $41.2, while annualized dividends based on the regular quarterly amounts declared on November 10, 2022, are estimated at $165.9.\nSource of Funds\nIt is managements view that the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have adequate access to capital markets and will have sufficient capital resources, both internal and external, to meet anticipated requirements.\nThe Companys, Spire Missouris and Spire Alabamas access to capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs, may depend on the credit rating of the entity that is accessing the capital markets. Their debt is rated by two rating agencies: Standard & Poors Corporation (S&P) and Moodys Investors Service (Moodys). As of September 30, 2022, the debt ratings of the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama (shown in the following table) remain at investment grade with a stable outlook (other than Moody's negative outlook for Spire Missouri debt).\nS&P\nMoodys\nSpire Inc. senior unsecured long-term debt\nBBB+\nBaa2\nSpire Inc. preferred stock\nBBB\nBa1\nSpire Inc. short-term debt\nA-2\nP-2\nSpire Missouri senior secured long-term debt\nA\nA1\nSpire Alabama senior unsecured long-term debt\nA-\nA2\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nBank deposits were used to support working capital needs of the business. Spire had no temporary cash investments as of September 30, 2022 or 2021.\nShort-term Debt\nThe Companys short-term cash requirements can be met through the sale of commercial paper or the use of a revolving credit facility. For information about these resources, see Note 7, Notes Payable and Credit Agreements, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 and Interest Rate Risk under Market Risk below.\nLong-term Debt and Equity\nAt September 30, 2022, including the current portion but excluding unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, Spire had long-term debt totaling $3,258.9, of which $1,648.0 was issued by Spire Missouri, $575.0 was issued by Spire Alabama, and $205.9 was issued by other subsidiaries. For more information about long-term debt, see Note 6 of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 and Interest Rate Risk under Market Risk below.\nOn December 7, 2021, pursuant to its registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC, Spire Missouri issued $300.0 of first mortgage bonds due December 2, 2024, secured equally with all its other first mortgage bonds. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears at a floating rate based on the compounded secured overnight financing rate plus 50 basis points, with a maximum rate of the lesser of 8% or the maximum rate then permitted by applicable law.\nEffective March 5, 2022, Spire Missouri was authorized by the MoPSC to issue conventional term loans, first mortgage bonds, unsecured debt, preferred stock and common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $800.0 for financings placed any time before December 31, 2024. As of September 30, 2022, the entire amount remained available under this authorization. Spire Alabama has no standing authority to issue long-term debt and must petition the APSC for each planned issuance.\nAfter fiscal year end, on October 13, 2022, Spire Alabama issued $90.0 of notes due October 15, 2029, bearing interest at 5.32% and $85.0 of notes due October 15, 2032, bearing interest at 5.41%. Interest is payable semi-annually. The notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equal in right to payment with all other senior unsecured indebtedness of Spire Alabama. Also on October 13, 2022, Spire Gulf issued $30.0 of first mortgage bonds due October 15, 2037, bearing interest at 5.61% payable semi-annually. The bonds rank equal in right to payment with the other first mortgage bonds issued by Spire Gulf. The bonds were issued under a supplemental indenture with collateral fall away provisions whereby, under certain conditions, Spire Gulf may elect to exchange the bonds, which are secured, for unsecured notes.\nSpire has a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC for the issuance and sale of up to 250,000 shares of common stock under its Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan. There were 158,535 and153,190 shares at September 30, 2022 and November 11, 2022, respectively, remaining available for issuance under this Form S-3. Spire and Spire Missouri also have a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC for the issuance of various equity and debt securities, which expires on May 9, 2025.\nOn February 6, 2019, Spire entered into an at-the-market (ATM) equity distribution agreement pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock pursuant to Spires universal shelf registration statement and a prospectus supplement. Under this program, a total of 626,249 shares with an aggregate offering price of $47.8 were issued in fiscal 2019 and 2020, and 354,000 shares with an aggregate offering price of $23.5 were issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. On April 28, 2022, Spires Board of Directors approved a new authorization for the sale of additional shares with an aggregate offering price of up to $200.0 before the May 2025 expiration of the new universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed in May 2022, under which a total of 365,625 shares with an aggregate offering price of $27.7 were issued in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.\nIn February 2021, Spire issued 3.5 million equity units for an aggregate stated amount of $175.0, resulting in net proceeds of $169.3 after underwriting fees and other issuance costs. See Note 5, Shareholders Equity, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional discussion of these equity units.\nIncluding the current portion of long-term debt, the Companys long-term consolidated capitalization consisted of 46% equity at September 30, 2022 and 47% equity at September 30, 2021. For more information about equity, see Note 5 of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nThe Utilities and other Spire subsidiaries own and operate natural gas distribution, transmission and storage facilities, the operations of which are subject to various environmental laws, regulations and interpretations. While environmental issues resulting from such operations arise in the ordinary course of business, such issues have not materially affected the Companys, Spire Missouris or Spire Alabamas financial position and results of operations. As environmental laws, regulations and their interpretations change, however, the Company and the Utilities may be required to incur additional costs. For information relative to environmental matters, see Contingencies in Note 16 of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nIn May and July 2021, the U.S. Department of Homeland Securitys Transportation Security Administration issued security directives that included several new cybersecurity requirements for critical pipeline owners and operators. Among these requirements is the implementation of specific mitigation measures to protect against ransomware attacks and other known threats to information and operational technology systems; development and implementation of a cybersecurity contingency and recovery plan; and performance of a cybersecurity architecture design review. We are currently implementing several of these directives and evaluating the potential effect of several others on our operations and facilities, as well as the potential cost of implementation, and will continue to monitor for any clarifications or amendments to these directives. We are also engaged in a continuous program of testing and updating our cybersecurity measures.\nFor discussions of other regulatory matters for Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama, see Note 15, Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nThe Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have evaluated recently issued accounting standards and concluded that none will have a material impact on their financial position or results of operations upon adoption.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following represent the more significant items requiring the use of judgment and estimates in preparing our financial statements:\nRegulatory Accounting - The Utilities account for their regulated operations in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 980, Regulated Operations. The provisions of this accounting guidance require, among other things, that financial statements of a rate-regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators, where appropriate. These actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non-rate-regulated enterprises. When this occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet (regulatory assets) and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates. Also, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future (regulatory liabilities). Management believes that the current regulatory environment supports the continued use of these regulatory accounting principles and that all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process. For Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, management believes the following represent the more significant items recorded through the application of this accounting guidance:\nPGA Clause - Spire Missouris PGA clauses allows it to flow through to customers, subject to a prudence review by the MoPSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies, including the costs, cost reductions and related carrying costs associated with the use of natural gas derivative instruments to hedge the purchase price of natural gas. The difference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the PGA clauses are recorded as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities that are recovered or refunded in a subsequent period. The PGA clauses also permit the application of carrying costs to all over- or under-recoveries of gas costs, including costs and cost reductions associated with the use of derivative instruments, and also provide for a portion of income from off-system sales and capacity release revenues to be flowed through to customers.\nGSA Rider - Spire Alabamas rate schedules for natural gas distribution charges contain a GSA rider, established in 1993, which permits the pass-through to customers of changes in the cost of gas supply. Spire Alabamas tariff provides a temperature adjustment mechanism, also included in the GSA, that is designed to moderate the impact of departures from normal temperatures on Spire Alabamas earnings. The temperature adjustment applies primarily to residential, small commercial and small industrial customers. Other non-temperature weather related conditions that may affect customer usage are not included in the temperature adjustment. In prior years, Spire Alabama entered into cash flow derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on its gas supply. Spire Alabama recognizes all derivatives at fair value as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. Any realized gains or losses are passed through to customers using the mechanisms of the GSA rider in accordance with Spire Alabamas APSC approved tariff and are recognized as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. All derivative commodity instruments in a gain position are valued on a discounted basis incorporating an estimate of performance risk specific to each related counterparty. Derivative commodity instruments in a loss position are valued on a discounted basis incorporating an estimate of performance risk specific to Spire Alabama. Spire Alabama currently has no active gas supply derivative positions.\nISRS - The ISRS allows Spire Missouri expedited recovery for its investment to upgrade its infrastructure and enhance its safety and reliability without the necessity of a formal rate case. Spire Missouri records ISRS revenues as authorized by the MoPSC and estimates the probability and amount of any refunds based on commission precedent, current legal rulings, the opinion of legal counsel, and other considerations.\nNon-operational Overhead Costs - As a result of certain MoPSC orders, Spire Missouri ceased capitalization of non-operational overhead costs but deferred such costs into a regulatory asset for future review by the MoPSC. Management believes it is probable that Spire Missouri will ultimately be allowed to recover these deferred costs.\nFor more information, see Note 15, Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nEmployee Benefits and Postretirement Obligations - Pension and postretirement obligations are calculated by actuarial consultants that utilize several statistical factors and other assumptions provided by management related to future events, such as discount rates, returns on plan assets, compensation increases, and mortality rates. For the Utilities, the amount of expense recognized and the amounts reflected in other comprehensive income are dependent upon the regulatory treatment provided for such costs, as discussed further below. Certain liabilities related to group medical benefits and workers compensation claims, portions of which are self-insured and/or contain stop-loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit exposure, are established based on historical trends.\nThe amount of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs recognized in the financial statements related to the Utilities qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans is based upon allowances, as approved by the MoPSC (for Spire Missouri) and as approved by the APSC (for Spire Alabama). The allowances have been established in the rate-making process for the recovery of these costs from customers. The differences between these amounts and actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs incurred for financial reporting purposes are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. GAAP also requires that changes that affect the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans, but that are not yet required to be recognized as components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs, be reflected in other comprehensive income. For the Utilities qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, amounts that would otherwise be reflected in other comprehensive income are deferred with entries to regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities.\nFor more information, see Note 13, Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nThe tables below reflect the sensitivity of Spires plans to potential changes in key assumptions:\nPension Plan Benefits:\nEstimated Increase/\n(Decrease) to\nEstimated Increase/\nIncrease/\nProjected\n(Decrease) to Annual\nActuarial Assumptions\n(Decrease)\nBenefit Obligation\nNet Pension Cost*\nDiscount Rate\n0.25 %\n$ (10.6 )\n$ 0.4\n(0.25 )%\n11.1\n(0.4 )\nExpected Return on Plan Assets\n0.25 %\n-\n(1.2 )\n(0.25 )%\n-\n1.2\nRate of Future Compensation Increase\n0.25 %\n0.7\n0.2\n(0.25 )%\n(0.7 )\n(0.2 )\nPostretirement Benefits:\nEstimated Increase/\n(Decrease) to\nEstimated Increase/\nProjected\n(Decrease) to Annual\nIncrease/\nPostretirement\nNet Postretirement\nActuarial Assumptions\n(Decrease)\nBenefit Obligation\nBenefit Cost*\nDiscount Rate\n0.25 %\n$ (2.8 )\n$ 0.1\n(0.25 )%\n2.9\n(0.1 )\nExpected Return on Plan Assets\n0.25 %\n-\n(0.7 )\n(0.25 )%\n-\n0.7\n*\nExcludes the impact of regulatory deferral mechanism. See Note 13, Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 for information regarding the regulatory treatment of these costs.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets - Long-lived assets classified as held and used are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Whether impairment has occurred is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets with the carrying value of the assets. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the Company recognizes an impairment charge equal to the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. In the period in which the Company determines an asset meets held-for-sale criteria, an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the book value exceeds its fair value less cost to sell.\nOn July 1, 2020, Spires Board of Directors, based upon the recommendation of senior management, revised the development plan for Spire Storage, resulting in an impairment charge of $140.8 related to Spire Storage assets in the quarter ended June 30, 2020. The revision was driven by the realization that a longer time horizon will be required for optimization and positioning of the storage facility to serve energy markets in the western United States. Among other factors, evaluations of the continuing evolution of market dynamics in the region led management to update models of various development alternatives. Separately in the quarter ended June 30, 2020, Spire recorded impairment charges totaling $7.8 related to two commercial compressed natural gas fueling stations as a result of revised projections reflecting lower diesel prices and slower conversions of Class 8 vehicles. The fair values used in measuring the impairment charges were determined with an expected present value technique using a discounted cash flow method under an income approach. Our impairment loss calculations required management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate fair values of the assets. This involved estimating cash flows, useful lives, and current market value for similar assets and selecting a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. Cash flow projections were based on assumptions about future market demand and achievement of certain operational capabilities. Assumptions were selected from a range of reasonably possible amounts and were supported by relevant and reliable data. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to additional impairments that could be material. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate asset impairment losses.\nAs discussed in Note 15, Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8, the Spire STL Pipeline is operating under temporary certificates while the FERC considers approval of a new permanent certificate. While uncertainty exists, management has evaluated the facts in accordance with ASC 360 and concluded that the related assets have not become impaired.\nIncome Taxes - Income tax calculations require estimates due to book-tax differences, estimates with respect to regulatory treatment of certain items, and uncertainty in the interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Critical assumptions and judgments also include projections of future taxable income to determine the ability to utilize net operating losses and credit carryforwards prior to their expiration. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management regularly assesses financial statement tax provisions to identify any change in regulatory treatment or tax related estimates and assumptions that could have a material impact on cash flows, financial position and/or results of operations. For more information, see Note 12, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nFor further discussion of significant accounting policies, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nMARKET RISK\nCommodity Price Risk\nGas Utility\nThe Utilities commodity price risk, which arises from market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, is primarily managed through the operation of Spire Missouris PGA clauses and Spire Alabamas GSA rider. The PGA clauses and GSA rider allows the Utilities to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the MoPSC and APSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies. Spire Missouri is allowed the flexibility to make up to three discretionary PGA changes during each year, in addition to its mandatory November PGA change, so long as such changes are separated by at least two months. Spire Missouri is able to mitigate, to some extent, changes in commodity prices through the use of physical storage supplies and regional supply diversity. Spire Alabama is allowed to make monthly changes to the GSA rate, but increases cannot exceed a 5% increase over the prior effective residential billing rate. The Utilities also have risk management policies that allow for the purchase of natural gas derivative instruments with the goal of managing its price risk associated with purchasing natural gas on behalf of its customers. These policies prohibit speculation. As of September 30, 2022, Spire Missouri had active natural gas derivative positions, but Spire Alabama did not. Costs and cost reduction, including carrying costs, associated with the use of natural gas derivative instruments are allowed to be passed on to customers through the operation of the PGA clauses or GSA rider. Accordingly, the Utilities do not expect any adverse earnings impact as a result of the use of these derivative instruments. However, the timing of recovery for cash payments related to margin requirements may cause short-term cash requirements to vary. For more information about the Utilities natural gas derivative instruments, see Note 10, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nGas Marketing\nIn the course of its business, Spires non-regulated gas marketing subsidiary, Spire Marketing, enters into contracts to purchase and sell natural gas at fixed prices and natural gas index-based prices. Commodity price risk associated with these contracts has the potential to impact earnings and cash flows. To minimize this risk, Spire Marketing has a risk management policy that provides for daily monitoring of a number of business measures, including fixed price commitments. In accordance with the risk management policy, Spire Marketing manages the price risk associated with its fixed price commitments. This risk is currently managed either by closely matching the offsetting physical purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed-prices or through the use of natural gas futures, options and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to lock in margins. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, Spire Marketings unmatched fixed-price positions were not material to Spires financial position or results of operations.\nAs mentioned above, Spire Marketing uses natural gas futures, options and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the NYMEX and ICE to manage the commodity price risk associated with its fixed-price natural gas purchase and sale commitments. These derivative instruments may be designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases or sales. Such accounting treatment, if elected, generally permits a substantial portion of the gain or loss to be deferred from recognition in earnings until the period that the associated forecasted purchase or sale is recognized in earnings. To the extent a hedge is effective, gains or losses on the derivatives will be offset by changes in the value of the hedged forecasted transactions. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, Spire Marketing had no designated cash flow hedges. Information about the fair values of Spire Marketings exchange-traded/cleared natural gas derivative instruments is presented below:\nDerivative\nDerivatives\nFair\nCash\nand Cash\nValues\nMargin\nMargin\nNet balance of derivative assets at September 30, 2021\n$ 52.1\n$ (39.3 )\n$ 12.8\nChanges in fair value\n43.3\n-\n43.3\nSettlements/purchases - net\n(84.8 )\n-\n(84.8 )\nChanges in cash margin\n-\n54.5\n54.5\nNet balance of derivative assets at September 30, 2022\n$ 10.6\n$ 15.2\n$ 25.8\nAs of September 30, 2022\nMaturity by Fiscal Year\nTotal\nFair values of exchange-traded/cleared natural gas derivatives - net\n$ 14.7\n$ 12.5\n$ 2.5\n$ (0.3 )\n$ -\nFair values of basis swaps - net\n(3.2 )\n(2.9 )\n(0.2 )\n(0.1 )\n-\nFair values of puts and calls - net\n(1.9 )\n(1.9 )\n-\n-\n-\nPosition volumes:\nMMBtu - net (short) long futures/swap/option positions\n84.1\n50.3\n19.5\n13.0\n1.3\nMMBtu - net (short) long basis swap positions\n(16.0 )\n(13.6 )\n(1.8 )\n(0.6 )\n-\nMMBtu - net (short) puts and calls positions\n(1.4 )\n(1.4 )\n-\n-\n-\nCertain of Spire Marketings physical natural gas derivative contracts are designated as normal purchases or normal sales, as permitted by GAAP. This election permits the Company to account for the contract in the period the natural gas is delivered. Contracts not designated as normal purchases or normal sales, including those designated as trading activities, are accounted for as derivatives with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the periods prior to settlement.\nBelow is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for physical natural gas contracts accounted for as derivatives, none of which will settle beyond fiscal 2023:\nNet balance of derivative liabilities at September 30, 2021\n$ (61.5 )\nChanges in fair value\n101.0\nSettlements\n(48.4 )\nNet balance of derivative liabilities at September 30, 2022\n$ (8.9 )\nFor further details related to Spire Marketings derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 10, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nCounterparty Credit Risk\nSpire Marketing has concentrations of counterparty credit risk in that a significant portion of its transactions are with energy producers, utility companies and pipelines. These concentrations of counterparties have the potential to affect the Companys overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that each of these three groups may be affected similarly by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. Spire Marketing also has concentrations of credit risk with certain individually significant counterparties. To the extent possible, Spire Marketing enters into netting arrangements with its counterparties to mitigate exposure to credit risk. It is also exposed to credit risk associated with its derivative contracts designated as normal purchases and normal sales. Spire Marketing closely monitors its credit exposure and, although uncollectible amounts have not been significant, increased counterparty defaults are possible and may result in financial losses and/or capital limitations. For more information on these and other concentrations of credit risk, including how Spire Marketing manages these risks, see Note 11, Concentrations of Credit Risk, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk associated with its short-term debt issuances. Based on average short-term borrowings during fiscal 2022, an increase of 100 basis points in the underlying average interest rate for short-term debt would have caused an increase in interest expense (and a decrease in pre-tax earnings and cash flows) of approximately $7.5 on an annual basis. Portions of such an increase may be offset through the Utilities application of PGA and GSA carrying costs. At September 30, 2022, Spire had fixed-rate long-term debt totaling $2,958.9, of which $1,348.0 was issued by Spire Missouri, $575.0 was issued by Spire Alabama, and $1,035.9 was issued by Spire and other subsidiaries. While the long-term debt issues are fixed-rate, they are subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change. However, increases or decreases in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the Company were to reacquire any of these issues in the open market prior to maturity. Under GAAP applicable to the Utilities regulated operations, losses or gains on early redemptions of long-term debt would typically be deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and amortized over a future period.\nRefer to Note 10, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional details on the Companys interest rate swap transactions.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022, of the Company and our report dated November 16, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nNovember 16, 2022\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Spire Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Spire Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 16, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRegulatory Matters - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 15 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company accounts for their regulated operations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 980, Regulated Operations. The provisions of this accounting guidance require, among other things, that financial statements of a rate-regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators, where appropriate. These actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non-rate-regulated enterprises. When this occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet (regulatory assets) and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates. Also, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future (regulatory liabilities).\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Missouri, Alabama, and Mississippi Public Service Commissions (the Commissions), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of natural gas companies within their respective geographies. The Company has stated that all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process.\nAccounting for the economics of rate regulation affects multiple financial statement line items, including property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; and depreciation expense, and affects multiple disclosures in the Companys financial statements. There is a risk that the Commissions will not approve full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. As a result, we identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of current and future regulatory orders on events that have occurred as of September 30, 2022, and the judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures. Management judgments included assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs or (2) refunds to customers or future reduction in rates. Given that managements accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these rate-impacted account balances and disclosures, and the related judgments, requires specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation due to the inherent complexities associated with the specialized rules related to accounting for the effects of cost-based regulation.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of managements controls over evaluating the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We tested the effectiveness of managements controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\nWe evaluated the Companys disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments, in the financial statements.\nWe read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company in Missouri, Alabama, and Mississippi; regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, and filings made by interveners; and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.\nWe obtained from management the regulatory orders that support the probability of recovery, refund, and/or future reduction in rates for regulatory assets and liabilities and assessed managements assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nNovember 16, 2022\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 1953.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholder and the Board of Directors of Spire Missouri Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Spire Missouri Inc.

As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of their internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRegulatory Matters - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 15 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company accounts for their regulated operations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 980, Regulated Operations. The provisions of this accounting guidance require, among other things, that financial statements of a rate-regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators, where appropriate. These actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non-rate-regulated enterprises. When this occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet (regulatory assets) and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates. Also, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future (regulatory liabilities).\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Alabama Public Service Commission (the Commission), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of natural gas companies within Alabama's geography. The Company has stated that all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process.\nAccounting for the economics of rate regulation affects multiple financial statement line items, including property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; and depreciation expense, and affects multiple disclosures in the Companys financial statements. There is a risk that the Commission will not approve full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. As a result, we identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of current and future regulatory orders on events that have occurred as of September 30, 2022, and the judgments made by management to support their assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures. Management judgments included assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs or (2) refunds to customers or future reduction in rates. Given that managements accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commission, auditing these rate-impacted account balances and disclosures, and the related judgments, requires specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation due to the inherent complexities associated with the specialized rules related to accounting for the effects of cost-based regulation.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commission included the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of managements controls over evaluating the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We tested the effectiveness of managements controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\nWe evaluated the Companys disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments, in the financial statements.\nWe read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commission for the Company in Alabama; regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, and filings made by interveners; and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.\nWe obtained from management the regulatory orders that support the probability of recovery, refund, and/or future reduction in rates for regulatory assets and liabilities and assessed managements assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nNovember 16, 2022\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2014.\nSPIRE INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nYears Ended September

millions, except per share, per unit and per gallon amounts)\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION - These notes are an integral part of the accompanying audited financial statements of Spire Inc. (Spire or the Company) presented on a consolidated basis, Spire Missouri Inc. (Spire Missouri) and Spire Alabama Inc. (Spire Alabama). Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and Spire EnergySouth Inc. (Spire EnergySouth) are wholly owned subsidiaries of Spire. Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and the subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth (Spire Gulf Inc. and Spire Mississippi Inc.) are collectively referred to as the Utilities. Unless otherwise indicated, references to years herein are references to the fiscal years ending September 30 for the Company and its subsidiaries.\nThe accompanying audited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Spire include the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiaries. Transactions and balances between consolidated entities have been eliminated from the consolidated financial statements of Spire. In compliance with GAAP, transactions between Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama and their affiliates, as well as intercompany balances on their balance sheets, have not been eliminated from their separate financial statements.\nNATURE OF OPERATIONS - Spire has two reportable segments: Gas Utility and Gas Marketing. The Gas Utility segment consists of the regulated natural gas distribution operations of the Company and is the core business segment of Spire in terms of revenue and earnings. The Gas Utility segment is comprised of the operations of: Spire Missouri, serving St. Louis, Kansas City, and other areas in Missouri; Spire Alabama, serving central and northern Alabama; and the subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth, serving the Mobile, Alabama area and south-central Mississippi. The Gas Marketing segment includes Spires primary gas-related business, Spire Marketing Inc. (Spire Marketing), which provides non-regulated natural gas services throughout the United States (U.S.). The activities of the Companys other subsidiaries are reported as Other and are described in Note 14, Information by Operating Segment. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama each have a single reportable segment.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSYSTEM OF ACCOUNTS - The accounts of the Utilities are maintained in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the applicable state public service commissions, which systems substantially conform to that prescribed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).\nREGULATED OPERATIONS - The Utilities account for their regulated operations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 980, Regulated Operations. This topic sets forth the application of GAAP for those companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent third-party regulator. The provisions of this accounting guidance require, among other things, that financial statements of a regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators, where appropriate. These actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non-regulated enterprises. When this occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet (regulatory assets) and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates. In addition, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future (regulatory liabilities). Management believes that the current regulatory environment supports the continued use of these regulatory accounting principles and that all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process. See additional discussion on regulated operations in Note 15, Regulatory Matters.\nPROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT -\nUtility Plant - Utility plant is stated at original cost. The cost of additions to utility plant includes contracted work, direct labor and materials, allocable overheads and an allowance for funds used during construction. The costs of units of property retired, replaced or renewed are removed from utility plant and are charged to accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs of property and replacement and renewal of items determined to be less than units of property are charged to maintenance expenses.\nUtility plant is depreciated using the composite method on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives of the various classes of property at rates approved by the applicable regulatory commission. For Spire Missouri and for Spire Alabama, the annual depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 averaged approximately 3% of the original cost of depreciable and amortizable property.\nNon-utility Property - Non-utility property is recorded at the original cost of acquisition or construction, which includes material, labor, contractor services and, for FERC-regulated projects, an allowance for funds used during construction. Repairs, replacements and renewals of items of property determined to be less than a unit of property or that do not increase the propertys life or functionality are charged to maintenance expense. Upon retirement or sale of non-utility property, the original cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the income statements. Costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related software. If software is retired prior to being fully amortized, the difference is recorded as a loss in the income statements.\nAccrued Capital Expenditures - Accrued capital expenditures, shown in the following table, are excluded from capital expenditures in the statements of cash flows until paid.\nSeptember 30\nSpire\n$ 77.8 $ 59.5 $ 67.6\nSpire Missouri\n45.6 37.1 34.3\nSpire Alabama\n19.2 13.6 17.0\nASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS - Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama record legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets in the period in which the obligations are incurred, if sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate the fair value of the obligations. Obligations are recorded as both a cost of the related long-lived asset and as a corresponding liability. Subsequently, the asset retirement costs are depreciated over the life of the asset and the asset retirement obligations are accreted to the expected settlement amounts. The Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama record asset retirement obligations associated with certain safety requirements to purge and seal gas distribution mains upon retirement, the plugging and abandonment of storage wells and other storage facilities, specific service line obligations, and certain removal and disposal obligations related to components of Spire Missouris, Spire Alabamas and Spire Gulfs distribution systems and general plant. Asset retirement obligations recorded by Spires other subsidiaries are not material. As authorized by the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC) and the Alabama Public Service Commission (APSC), Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and Spire Gulf accrue future asset removal costs associated with their property, plant and equipment even if a legal obligation does not exist. Such accruals are provided for through depreciation expense and are recorded with corresponding credits to regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets. When those utilities retire depreciable utility plant and equipment, they charge the associated original costs to accumulated depreciation and amortization, and any related removal costs incurred are charged to regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets. The difference between removal costs recognized in depreciation rates and the accretion expense and depreciation expense recognized for financial reporting purposes is a timing difference between recovery of these costs in rates and their recognition for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, these differences are deferred as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets. In the rate setting process, the regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets are excluded from the rate base upon which those utilities have the opportunity to earn their allowed rates of return.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of asset retirement obligations at September 30, as reported in the balance sheets.\nSpire\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Alabama\nAsset retirement obligations, beginning of year\n$ 519.6 $ 540.1 $ 143.4 $ 153.4 $ 362.8 $ 374.3\nLiabilities incurred during the period\n3.2 11.1 1.2 1.4 0.5 7.4\nLiabilities settled during the period\n(9.2 ) (21.9 ) (4.1 ) (9.7 ) (2.0 ) (10.7 )\nAccretion\n21.1 21.8 5.9 6.2 14.7 15.0\nRevisions in estimated cash flows\n(13.8 ) (31.5 ) (35.8 ) (7.9 ) 22.7 (23.2 )\nAsset retirement obligations, end of year\n$ 520.9 $ 519.6 $ 110.6 $ 143.4 $ 398.7 $ 362.8\nNATURAL GAS AND PROPANE GAS - For Spire Missouris eastern region, inventory of natural gas in storage is priced on a last in, first out (LIFO) basis and inventory of propane gas in storage is priced on a first in, first out (FIFO) basis. For the rest of the Gas Utility segment, inventory of natural gas in storage is priced on the weighted average cost basis. The replacement cost of Spire Missouris natural gas for current use in eastern Missouri at September 30, 2022 was more than the LIFO cost by $37.3. The replacement cost of Spire Missouris natural gas for current use in eastern Missouri at September 30, 2021 was less than the LIFO cost by $14.0. The carrying value of the Utilities inventory is never adjusted to a lower net realizable value or market value because, pursuant to Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clauses or a Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) rider, actual gas costs are recovered in customer rates. Natural gas and propane gas storage inventory in Spires other operating segments is recorded at the lower of average cost or net realizable value.\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL - Spires acquisitions were accounted for using business combination accounting. Under this method, the purchase price paid by the acquirer is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date based on their fair value. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred over the amount of acquisition-date identifiable assets acquired net of assumed liabilities. At September 30, 2022, goodwill included in Spires Gas Utility and Gas Marketing segments was $210.2 and zero, respectively, with the remainder held at the corporate level. Goodwill amounts have not changed since fiscal 2017, and there are no accumulated impairment losses. Spire and Spire Missouri evaluate goodwill for impairment as of July 1 of each year, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. At each test date, the assessments concluded that goodwill was not impaired. The Company updated the assessments as of September 30, 2022, determining that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.\nIMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS - Long-lived assets classified as held and used are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Whether impairment has occurred is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets with the carrying value of the assets. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the Company recognizes an impairment charge equal to the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. In the period in which the Company determines an asset meets held-for-sale criteria, an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the book value exceeds its fair value less cost to sell.\nOn July 1, 2020, Spires Board of Directors, based upon the recommendation of senior management, revised the development plan for Spire Storage, resulting in an impairment charge of $140.8 related to Spire Storage assets (non-utility property on the balance sheet) in the quarter ended June 30, 2020. The revision was driven by the realization that a longer time horizon will be required for optimization and positioning of the storage facility to serve energy markets in the western United States. Among other factors, evaluations of the continuing evolution of market dynamics in the region led management to update models of various development alternatives. Separately in the quarter ended June 30, 2020, Spire recorded impairment charges totaling $7.8 related to two commercial compressed natural gas fueling stations (also non-utility property) as a result of revised projections reflecting lower diesel prices and slower conversions of Class 8 vehicles. The fair values used in measuring the impairment charges were determined with an expected present value technique using a discounted cash flow method under an income approach. In the quarter ended September 30, 2021, Spire sold one of the fueling stations and recorded a gain of $1.3.\nDERIVATIVES - In the course of their business, certain subsidiaries of Spire enter into commitments associated with the purchase or sale of natural gas. Certain of their derivative natural gas contracts are designated as normal purchases or normal sales and, as such, are excluded from the scope of FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Those contracts are accounted for as executory contracts and recorded on an accrual basis. Revenues and expenses from such contracts are recorded gross. Contracts not designated as normal purchases or normal sales are recorded as derivatives with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the periods prior to physical delivery. Certain of Spire Marketings wholesale purchase and sale transactions are classified as trading activities for financial reporting purposes, with income and expenses presented on a net basis in natural gas expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Spire also enters into cash flow hedges through execution of interest rate swap contracts to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates. Refer to Note 10, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, for more information about derivatives.\nINCOME TAXES - Spire and its subsidiaries account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax basis and for tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. The effects on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in enacted tax rates is recognized in income or loss for non-regulated operations, and in a regulatory asset or regulatory liability for regulated operations. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with authoritative guidance. The authoritative guidance addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed, or expected to be claimed, on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Spire may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits of the position. Tax-related interest and penalties, if any, are classified as a liability on the balance sheets. For additional information on the accounting for income taxes, refer to Note 12, Income Taxes.\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH - All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. Such instruments are carried at cost, which approximates market value. Outstanding checks on the Companys and Utilities bank accounts in excess of funds on deposit create book overdrafts (which are funded at the time checks are presented for payment) and are classified as Other in the Current Liabilities section of the balance sheets. Changes in book overdrafts are reflected as Operating Activities in the statements of cash flows. In Spires statements of cash flows, total Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash included $14.0 and $7.0 of restricted cash reported in Other Investments on the Companys balance sheet as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (in addition to amounts shown as Cash and cash equivalents). This restricted cash has been segregated and invested in debt securities in a trust account based on collateral requirements for reinsurance at Spires risk management company.\nNATURAL GAS RECEIVABLE - Spire Marketing enters into natural gas transactions with natural gas pipeline and storage companies known as park and loan arrangements. Under the terms of the arrangements, Spire Marketing purchases natural gas from a third party and delivers that natural gas to the pipeline or storage company for the right to receive the same quantity of natural gas from that company at the same location in a future period. These arrangements are accounted for as non-monetary transactions under GAAP and are recorded at the carrying amount. As such, natural gas receivables are reflected in Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at cost, which includes related fees associated with the transactions. In the period that the natural gas is returned to Spire Marketing, concurrent with the sale of the natural gas to a third party, the related natural gas receivable is expensed in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In conjunction with these transactions, Spire Marketing usually enters into New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) natural gas futures, options, and swap contracts or fixed price sales agreements to protect against market changes in future sales prices.\nEARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE - GAAP requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS). EPS is computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method for computing EPS that treats a participating security as having rights to earnings that would otherwise have been available to common shareholders. Certain of the Companys stock-based compensation awards pay non-forfeitable dividends to the participants during the vesting period and, as such, are deemed participating securities. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding that are increased for additional shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive non-participating securities were converted to common shares, pursuant to the treasury stock method. Shares attributable to equity units, non-participating stock options and time-vested restricted stock/units are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share if the effect would be antidilutive. Shares attributable to non-participating performance-contingent restricted stock awards are only included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share to the extent the underlying performance and/or market conditions are satisfied (a) prior to the end of the reporting period or (b) would be satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the end of the related contingency period and the result would be dilutive. The Companys EPS computations are presented in Note 4, Earnings Per Common Share.\nTRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES - Transactions between affiliates of the Company have been eliminated from the consolidated financial statements of Spire. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama borrowed funds from the Company and incurred related interest, as reflected in their separate financial statements, and they participated in normal intercompany shared services transactions. In addition, Spire Missouris and Spire Alabamas other transactions with affiliates included:\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Alabama\nNatural gas purchases from Spire Marketing\n$ 86.3 $ 92.5 $ 56.9 $ 3.2 $ 10.4 $ 6.3\nNatural gas sales to Spire Marketing\n- 1.1 0.1 0.5 0.1 0.3\nTransportation services from Spire STL Pipeline LLC\n32.0 32.0 27.9 - - -\nTransportation services from Spire NGL Inc.\n- 0.5 1.0 - - -\nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES - Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the amounts due from customers, including unbilled amounts. Accounts receivable are written off when they are deemed to be uncollectible. An allowance for expected credit losses is estimated and updated based on relevant data and trends such as accounts receivable aging, historical write-off experience, current write-off trends, economic conditions, and the impact of weather and availability of customer payment assistance on collection trends. For the Utilities, net write-offs as a percentage of revenue has historically been the best predictor of base net write-off experience over time. Management judgment is applied in the development of the allowance due to the complexity of variables and subjective nature of certain relevant factors. The estimates for expected credit losses were increased as a result of considerations related to the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, including trends from previous economic downturns, the effects of moratoriums on gas service cutoffs, and the effects of slower-than-normal disconnection activity in general, offset by the amount subject to specific recovery under Missouris deferral order (see Note 15, Regulatory Matters). The accounts receivable of Spires non-utility businesses are evaluated separately from those of the Utilities. The allowance for credit losses for those other businesses is based on a continuous evaluation of the individual counterparty risk and is not significant for the periods presented. Activity in the allowance for credit losses is shown in the following table.\nSpire\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Alabama\nAllowance at beginning of year\n$ 30.3 $ 24.9 $ 23.0 $ 22.6 $ 18.1 $ 14.9 $ 6.6 $ 5.5 $ 6.3\nProvision for expected credit losses\n11.6 14.7 14.0 11.2 11.1 12.7 0.3 3.1 0.9\nWrite-offs, net of recoveries\n(10.0 ) (9.3 ) (12.1 ) (8.9 ) (6.6 ) (9.5 ) (0.6 ) (2.0 ) (1.7 )\nAllowance at end of year\n$ 31.9 $ 30.3 $ 24.9 $ 24.9 $ 22.6 $ 18.1 $ 6.3 $ 6.6 $ 5.5\nFINANCE RECEIVABLES - Spire Alabama finances third party contractor sales of merchandise including gas furnaces and appliances. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, Spire Alabamas finance receivable totaled approximately $7.1 and $7.8, respectively. Financing is available only to qualified customers who meet creditworthiness thresholds for customer payment history and external agency credit reports. Spire Alabama relies upon ongoing payments as the primary indicator of credit quality during the term of each contract. The allowance for credit losses is recognized using an estimate of write-off percentages based on historical experience. Delinquent accounts are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and, absent evidence of debt repayment, after 90 days are due in full and assigned to a third-party collection agency. The remaining finance receivable is written off approximately 12 months after being assigned to the third-party collection agency. Spire Alabama had finance receivables past due 90 days or more of $0.3 at September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nGROUP MEDICAL AND WORKERS COMPENSATION RESERVES - The Company self-insures its group medical and workers compensation costs and carries stop-loss coverage in relation to medical claims and workers compensation claims. Reserves for amounts incurred but not reported are established based on historical cost levels and lags between occurrences and reporting.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS - Certain assets and liabilities are recognized or disclosed at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.\nThe levels of the hierarchy are described below:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Pricing inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability as of the reporting date. These inputs are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.\nLevel 3 - Pricing that is based upon inputs that are generally unobservable that are based on the best information available and reflect managements assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability.\nAssessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements may require judgment and may affect the valuation of the asset or liability and its placement within the fair value hierarchy. Additional information about fair value measurements is provided in Note 8, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Note 9, Fair Value Measurements, and Note 13, Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION - The Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. The Company measures stock-based compensation awards at fair value at the date of grant and recognizes the compensation cost of the awards over the requisite service period. Forfeitures are recognized in the period they occur. Refer to Note 3, Stock-Based Compensation, for further discussion of the accounting for the Companys stock-based compensation plans.\n2.

The sale of natural gas is governed by the various state utility commissions, which set rates, charges, and terms and conditions of service, collectively included in a tariff. The performance obligation, which relates to the promise to provide natural gas, is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the natural gas, and revenue is recognized accordingly.\nThe Utilities transportation revenue relates to the promise to transport the specified quantities of natural gas at tariff rates. This performance obligation is satisfied over time as the gas is transported, and revenue is recognized as invoiced monthly.\nThe Utilities have alternative revenue programs (ARPs), which represent an agreement between the utility and its regulator, currently consisting of decoupling mechanisms (also known as weather normalization adjustments) and incentive programs (primarily Alabamas Cost Control Measure). When the criteria to recognize additional (or reduced) revenue from ARPs have been met, the Utilities establish a regulatory asset (or liability). When amounts previously recognized for ARPs are billed, the Utilities reduce the regulatory asset (or liability) and increase (or decrease) accounts receivable. Billed amounts, which are part of the overall tariff paid by customers, are included in revenue from contracts with customers, while the change in the related regulatory asset or liability is presented as revenue from ARPs. Depending on whether the beginning accrued ARP balance was a regulatory asset or liability and depending on the size and direction of the current period accrual, the amount presented as revenue from ARPs could be negative.\nThe Utilities read meters and bill customers on monthly cycles. Spire Missouri, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi record their gas utility revenues from gas sales and transportation services on an accrual basis that includes estimated amounts for gas delivered but not yet billed. The accruals for unbilled revenues are reversed in the subsequent accounting period when meters are actually read and customers are billed. Spire Alabama records natural gas distribution revenues in accordance with the tariff established by the APSC. Unbilled revenue is accrued in an amount equal to the related gas cost, as profit margin is not considered earned until billed. Spires other subsidiaries, including Spire Marketing, record revenues when earned, as the product is delivered or as services are performed.\nGas Marketings contracts are derivatives. Wholesale contracts (with producers, municipalities, and utility companies) are subject to derivative accounting. Retail contracts (with large commercial and industrial customers) are designated as normal purchase, normal sale arrangements and are therefore accounted for as revenue from contracts with customers. The performance obligation is satisfied over time by the transfer of control of natural gas to the customer, and revenue is recognized as invoiced monthly.\nPayments are generally required within 30 days of billing, and contracts generally do not have a significant financing component. Spires revenues are not subject to significant returns, refunds, or warranty obligations.\nSpire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama have elected to apply a right to invoice practical expedient, recognizing revenue for volumes delivered for which they have a right to invoice, as long as that amount corresponds with the value to the customer. Disclosures about remaining performance obligations are not required because either contracts have an original expected duration of one year or less, or revenue is recognized under the right to invoice practical expedient, or both.\nSales taxes imposed on applicable Spire Alabama and Spire Missouri sales are billed to customers. These amounts are not recorded in the statements of income but are recorded as tax collections payable and included in the Other line of the Current Liabilities section of the balance sheets.\nGross receipts taxes associated with the Companys natural gas utility services are imposed on the Company, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama and billed to its customers. The expense amounts (shown in the table below) are reported gross in the Taxes, other than income taxes line in the statements of income, and corresponding revenues are reported in Operating Revenues.\nSpire\n$ 109.8 $ 94.0 $ 91.5\nSpire Missouri\n79.6 64.3 63.5\nSpire Alabama\n25.5 25.1 23.3\n3. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Spire 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (EIP) was approved by shareholders of Spire on January 29, 2015 and amended on November 9, 2018. The purpose of the EIP is to encourage directors, officers, and key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries to contribute to the Companys success and align their interests with that of shareholders. To accomplish this purpose, the Compensation Committee (Committee) of Spires Board of Directors (the Board) may grant awards under the EIP that may be earned by achieving performance objectives and/or other criteria as determined by the Committee. Under the terms of the EIP, officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, as determined by the Committee, are eligible to be selected for awards. The EIP provides for restricted stock, restricted stock units, qualified and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, and performance shares payable in stock, cash, or a combination of both. The EIP generally provides a minimum vesting period of at least three years for each type of award, with pro rata vesting permitted during the minimum three-year vesting period. The maximum number of shares reserved for issuance under the EIP is 1,000,000.\nThe Company issues new shares to satisfy employee restricted stock awards.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company granted 128,396 performance-contingent restricted share units to executive officers and key employees at a weighted average grant date fair value of $67.43 per share. This number represents the target shares that can be earned pursuant to the terms of the awards. The share units have a performance period ending September 30, 2025. While the participants have no interim voting rights on these share units, dividends accrue during the performance period and are paid to the participants upon vesting but are subject to forfeiture if the underlying share units do not vest.\nThe number of share units that will ultimately vest is dependent upon the attainment of certain levels of earnings and other strategic goals, as well as the Companys level of total shareholder return (TSR) during the performance period relative to a comparator group of peer companies. This TSR provision is considered a market condition under GAAP and is discussed further below. The maximum amount of shares that can be earned pursuant to the terms of the awards is 200% of the target units granted.\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of performance-contingent restricted share units granted during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was $68.69 and $76.19 per share, respectively.\nFiscal 2022 activity of restricted stock units subject to performance and/or market conditions is presented below:\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nUnits\nPer Unit\nNonvested at September 30, 2021\n312,596 $ 74.33\nGranted\n128,396 $ 67.43\nVested\n(91,111 ) $ 79.40\nForfeited\n(6,357 ) $ 69.43\nNonvested at September 30, 2022\n343,524 $ 70.14\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, the total number of shares that could be issued if all outstanding award grants attain maximum performance payout is 687,048.\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company granted 62,945 shares of time-vested restricted stock to executive officers and key employees at a weighted average grant date fair value of $63.57 per share. Unless forfeited based on terms of the agreements, these shares will vest in fiscal 2025. In the interim, participants receive full voting rights and dividends, which are not subject to forfeiture. The weighted average grant date fair value of time-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units awarded to employees during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was $64.29 and $76.13 per share, respectively.\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company granted 16,290 shares of time-vested restricted stock to non-employee directors at a weighted average grant date fair value of $66.31 per share. These shares vested in fiscal 2022, six months after the grant date. The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock awarded to non-employee directors during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was $62.35 and $84.58 per share, respectively.\nTime-vested restricted stock and stock unit activity for fiscal 2022 is presented below:\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant Date\nShares/\nFair Value\nUnits\nPer Share\nNonvested at September 30, 2021\n110,300 $ 70.98\nGranted\n62,945 $ 63.57\nVested\n(46,970 ) $ 72.67\nForfeited\n(4,030 ) $ 68.62\nNonvested at September 30, 2022\n122,245 $ 66.60\nFor restricted stock and stock units (performance-contingent and time-vested) that vested during fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company withheld 28,055 shares, 16,787 shares, and 41,353 shares, respectively, at weighted average prices of $63.97, $65.99 and $77.07 per share, respectively, pursuant to elections by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations. The total fair value of restricted stock (performance-contingent and time-vested) that vested during fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $10.1, $6.5, and $9.8, respectively, and the related tax benefit was $3.8, $2.5, and $3.7, respectively. None of the tax benefits have been realized.\nThe Company allows participants in the EIP the ability to defer a portion or all of their award. As at September 30, 2022, a total of 228,988 shares (at target payout) have been deferred by Participants.\nEquity Compensation Costs\nCompensation cost for performance-contingent restricted stock and stock unit awards is based upon the probable outcome of the performance conditions. For shares or units that do not vest or that are not expected to vest due to the outcome of the performance conditions (excluding market conditions), no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed.\nThe fair value of awards of performance-contingent and time-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units, not subject to the TSR provision, are estimated using the closing price of the Companys stock on the grant date. For those awards that do not pay dividends during the vesting period, the estimate of fair value is reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the Companys common stock during the performance period, discounted using an appropriate U.S. Treasury yield. For shares subject to the TSR provision, the estimated impact of this market condition is reflected in the grant date fair value per share of the awards. Accordingly, compensation cost is not reversed to reflect any actual reductions in the awards that may result from the TSR provision. However, if the Companys TSR during the performance period ranks below the level specified in the award agreements, relative to a comparator group of companies, and the Committee elects not to reduce the award (or reduce by a lesser amount), this election would be accounted for as a modification of the original award and additional compensation cost would be recognized at that time. The grant date fair value of the awards subject to the TSR provision awarded during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was valued by a Monte Carlo simulation model that assessed the probabilities of various TSR outcomes. The significant assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulations are as follows:\nRisk-free interest rate\n0.79%\n0.22%\n1.57%\nExpected dividend yield of stock\n- - -\nExpected volatility of stock\n32.2%\n31.4%\n16.8%\nVesting period (in years)\n3.0 3.0 3.0\nThe risk-free interest rate was based on the yield on U.S. Treasury securities matching the vesting period. A zero-percent dividend yield was used, which is mathematically equivalent to the assumption that dividends are reinvested as they are paid. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock. Volatility assumptions were also made for each of the companies included in the comparator group. The vesting period is equal to the performance period set forth in the terms of the award.\nThe amounts of compensation cost recognized for share-based compensation arrangements are presented below:\nTotal compensation cost\n$ 7.5 $ 16.6 $ 9.4\nCompensation cost capitalized\n(1.1 ) (2.7 ) (0.6 )\nCompensation cost recognized in net income\n6.4 13.9 8.8\nIncome tax benefit recognized in net income\n(1.5 ) (3.2 ) (2.1 )\nCompensation cost recognized in net income, net of income tax\n$ 4.9 $ 10.7 $ 6.7\nAs of September 30, 2022, there was $11.2 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years.\n4.

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY\nSpire\nPreferred Stock\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, Spire had authorized 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock.\nOn May 21, 2019, Spire completed the public offering of 10,000,000 depositary shares (the Depositary Shares), each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of the Companys 5.90% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $25.00 per share, with a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share (the Preferred Stock). The transaction resulted in $242.0 of net proceeds, after deducting commissions and sale expenses, which proceeds were used to (i) refinance long-term and short-term Spire debt and (ii) fund capital expenditures at both the Utilities and Spires gas-related businesses.\nDividends on the Preferred Stock, when declared by the Board, are payable on the liquidation preference amount, on a cumulative basis, quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of February, May, August and November of each year, beginning on August 15, 2019. Dividends are payable out of amounts legally available for the payment of dividends at an annual rate equal to 5.90% of the liquidation preference per share of Preferred Stock (equivalent to $25.00 per Depositary Share). Dividends accumulate daily and are cumulative from May 21, 2019.\nUnder the terms of the Preferred Stock, the Companys ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase or redeem, shares of its common stock or any class or series of capital stock of the Company that rank junior to the Preferred Stock are subject to certain restrictions in the event that the Company does not declare and pay the full cumulative dividends on the Preferred Stock through the most recently completed quarterly dividend period.\nSpire may, at its option, redeem the Preferred Stock (i) in whole, but not in part, at any time prior to August 15, 2024, within 120 days after a ratings event where a rating agency amends, clarifies or changes the criteria it uses to assign equity credit for securities such as the Preferred Stock, at a redemption price in cash equal to $25,500 per share, or (ii) in whole or in part, from time to time, on or after August 15, 2024, at a redemption price in cash equal to $25,000 per share, plus, in each case, all accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether declared or not) up to such redemption date.\nShareholders of the Preferred Stock generally have no voting rights with respect to matters that generally require the approval of voting stockholders. The limited voting rights of holders of the Preferred Stock include the right to vote on certain matters that may affect the preference or special rights of the Preferred Stock. In addition, if and whenever dividends on any shares of Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid for at least six dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors then constituting the Board shall automatically be increased by two (to be elected by the holders of the Preferred Stock) until all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock have been paid in full.\nEquity Units\nIn February 2021, Spire issued 3.5 million equity units, initially in the form of Corporate Units, for an aggregate stated amount of $175.0, resulting in net proceeds (after underwriting fees and other issuance costs) of $169.3. Each Corporate Unit has a stated amount of fifty dollars and consists of (i) a stock purchase contract and (ii) a 1/20, or 5%, undivided beneficial ownership interest in one thousand dollars principal amount of Spires 2021 Series A 0.75% Remarketable Senior Notes due March 1, 2026 (RSNs). The RSNs are pledged as collateral to secure the holders obligation under the related stock purchase contracts. Each stock purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase, and Spire to issue and deliver, on March 1, 2024, for a price of fifty dollars in cash, a variable number of shares of its common stock as follows (subject to anti-dilution adjustments).\nIf the applicable market value* per share\nNumber of shares to be purchased per\nof Spire common stock is:\nstock purchase contract is:\nEqual to or greater than $78.6906 (threshold appreciation price)\n0.6354 (minimum settlement rate)\nLess than $78.6906, but greater than $64.24\n$50.00 \u00f7 applicable market value*\nLess than or equal to $64.24 (reference price)\n0.7783 (maximum settlement rate)\n*Based on the volume-weighted average price of Spire common stock during the 20 trading days before settlement.\nIf a holder elects to settle purchase contracts early, the holder would pay fifty dollars per unit and receive 0.6354 shares per unit.\nThe Company makes quarterly interest payments on the RSNs at the rate of 0.75% per year and quarterly contract adjustment payments on the stock purchase contracts at the rate of 6.75%. The RSNs and the contract adjustment payments are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of Spires subsidiaries.\nAt issuance, the Company recorded the $35.0 present value of the stock purchase contract payments as a liability (reflected in Other current and noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet) offset by a charge to additional paid-in capital in equity. This noncash financing activity has been excluded from the statement of cash flows. Interest payments on the RSNs are recorded as interest expense and stock purchase contract payments are charged against the liability. Accretion of the stock purchase contract liability is recorded as imputed interest expense. In calculating diluted EPS, the Company applies the treasury stock method to the Corporate Units. These securities have not had an effect on diluted EPS.\nIn order to secure funds necessary for the holders to pay the purchase price of the common stock on the purchase contract settlement date, the remarketing agent will remarket the RSNs on behalf of the current holders to new third-party investors. Following any successful remarketing of the RSNs, the interest rate on the RSNs will be reset, interest will be payable on a semi-annual basis, and Spire will cease to have the option to redeem the RSNs, other than in connection with the occurrence or continuance of certain special events.\nATM Program\nOn February 6, 2019, Spire entered into an at-the-market (ATM) equity distribution agreement pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock pursuant to Spires universal shelf registration statement and a prospectus supplement. Under this program, a total of 626,249 shares with an aggregate offering price of $47.8 were issued in fiscal 2019 and 2020, and 354,000 shares with an aggregate offering price of $23.5 were issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. On April 28, 2022, Spires Board of Directors approved a new authorization for the sale of additional shares with an aggregate offering price of up to $200.0 before the May 2025 expiration of the new universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed in May 2022, under which a total of 365,625 shares with an aggregate offering price of $27.7 were issued in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.\nOther Equity Information\nSpire has a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the issuance and sale of up to 250,000 shares of common stock under its Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan. There were 158,535 and 153,190 shares at September 30, 2022 and November 11, 2022, respectively, remaining available for issuance under this Form S-3. Spire also has a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC for the issuance of various equity and debt securities, which expires on May 9, 2025.\nSpire Missouri\nSubstantially all of Spire Missouris plant is subject to the liens of its first mortgage bonds. The mortgage contains several restrictions on Spire Missouris ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock or to make loans to its parent company. These mortgage restrictions are applicable regardless of whether the stock is publicly held or held solely by Spire Missouris parent company. Under the most restrictive of these provisions, no cash dividend may be declared or paid if, after the dividend, the aggregate net amount spent for all dividends after September 30, 1953 would exceed a maximum amount determined by a formula set out in the mortgage. Under that formula, the maximum amount is the sum of $8.0 plus earnings applicable to common stock (adjusted for stock repurchases and issuances) for the period from September 30, 1953 to the last day of the quarter before the declaration or payment date for the dividends. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the amount under the mortgages formula that was available to pay dividends was $1,579.4 and $1,413.4, respectively. Thus, all of Spire Missouris retained earnings were free from such dividend restrictions as of those dates.\nSpire Missouri has a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC for the issuance of various equity and debt securities, which expires on May 9, 2025. Effective March 5, 2022, Spire Missouri was authorized by the MoPSC to issue conventional term loans, first mortgage bonds, unsecured debt, preferred stock and common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $800.0 for financings placed any time before December 31, 2024.

Except for $300.0 of Spire Missouri floating-rate bonds, all long-term debt bears fixed rates and is subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change. However, increases and decreases in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the Company were to reacquire any of these issues in the open market prior to maturity. Under GAAP applicable to the Utilities regulated operations, losses or gains on early redemption of long-term debt would typically be deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and amortized over a future period.

NOTES PAYABLE AND CREDIT AGREEMENTS\nSpire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have a syndicated revolving credit facility pursuant to a loan agreement with 12 banks, which was amended July 22, 2022, to increase the commitment and sublimits and extend the agreement through July 22, 2027. The amended loan agreement has an aggregate credit commitment of $1,300.0, including sublimits of $450.0 for the Spire holding company, $575.0 for Spire Missouri and $275.0 for Spire Alabama. These sublimits may be reallocated from time to time among the three borrowers within the $1,300.0 aggregate commitment, with commitment fees and interest margins applied for each borrower relative to its credit rating, as well as sustainability rate adjustments based on Spire's DART (\"Days Away Restricted or Transferred\") rate and methane emissions reductions. The Spire holding company may use its line to provide for the funding needs of various subsidiaries. The agreement also contains financial covenants limiting each borrowers consolidated total debt, including short-term debt, to no more than 70% of its total capitalization. As defined in the line of credit, on September 30, 2022, total debt was less than or equal to 60% of total capitalization for each borrower. There were no borrowings against this credit facility as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nSpire has a commercial paper program (CP Program) pursuant to which it may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe information presented below categorizes the assets and liabilities in the balance sheets that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition.\nThe mutual funds included in Level 1 are valued based on exchange-quoted market prices of individual securities. The mutual funds included in Level 2 are valued based on the closing net asset value per unit.\nDerivative instruments included in Level 1 are valued using quoted market prices on the NYMEX or the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Derivative instruments classified in Level 2 include physical commodity derivatives that are valued using broker or dealer quotation services whose prices are derived principally from, or are corroborated by, observable market inputs. Also included in Level 2 are certain derivative instruments that have values that are similar to, and correlate with, quoted prices for exchange-traded instruments in active markets. Derivative instruments included in Level 3 are valued using generally unobservable inputs that are based upon the best information available and reflect managements assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability. There were no Level 3 balances as of September 30, 2022 or 2021. The Companys and the Utilities policy is to recognize transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy, if any, as of the beginning of the interim reporting period in which circumstances change or events occur to cause the transfer.\nThe mutual funds are included in Other investments on the Companys balance sheets and in Other Property and Investments on Spire Missouris balance sheets. Changes in their recurring valuations are recorded as unrealized investment gains or losses in the corresponding periodic income statement. Derivative assets and liabilities, including receivables and payables associated with cash margin requirements, are presented net on the balance sheets when a legally enforceable netting agreement exist between the Company, Spire Missouri or Spire Alabama and the counterparty to the derivative contract.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nSpire\nSpire Missouri has a risk management policy to utilize various derivatives, including futures contracts, exchange-traded options and swaps for the explicit purpose of managing price risk associated with purchasing and delivering natural gas on a regular basis to customers in accordance with its tariffs. The objective of this policy is to limit Spire Missouris exposure to natural gas price volatility and to manage, hedge and mitigate substantial price risk. Further discussion of this policy can be found in the Spire Missouri section.\nFrom time to time Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama purchase NYMEX futures and options contracts to help stabilize operating costs associated with forecasted purchases of gasoline and diesel fuels used to power vehicles and equipment. Further information on these derivatives can be found in the Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama sections, respectively.\nIn the course of its business, Spires gas marketing subsidiary, Spire Marketing (including a wholly owned subsidiary), enters into commitments associated with the purchase or sale of natural gas. Certain of Spire Marketings derivative natural gas contracts are designated as normal purchases or normal sales and, as such, are excluded from the scope of ASC Topic 815 and are accounted for as executory contracts on an accrual basis. Any of Spire Marketings derivative natural gas contracts that are not designated as normal purchases or normal sales are accounted for at fair value. At September 30, 2022, the fair values of 492.2 million MMBtu of non-exchange-traded natural gas commodity contracts were reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Of these contracts, 347.8 million MMBtu will settle during fiscal 2023, and 88.8 million MMBtu, 47.5 million MMBtu, 7.0 million MMBtu, and 1.1 million MMBtu will settle during fiscal years 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively. These contracts have not been designated as hedges; therefore, changes in the fair value of these contracts are reported in earnings each period.\nFurthermore, Spire Marketing manages the price risk associated with its fixed-priced commitments by either closely matching the offsetting physical purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed prices or through the use of NYMEX or ICE futures, swap, and option contracts to lock in margins.\nAt September 30, 2022, Spire Marketings unmatched fixed-price positions were not material to Spires financial position or results of operations. Spire Marketings NYMEX and ICE natural gas futures, swap and option contracts used to lock in margins may be designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions for financial reporting purposes.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, the Company entered into multiple ten-year interest rate swaps with fixed interest rates ranging from 0.934% to 1.2975% for a total notional amount of $75.0 to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates on future interest rate payments. The Company recorded a $9.8 mark-to-market gain in accumulated other comprehensive income on these swaps for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. In the third quarter of 2021 the Company entered into multiple ten-year interest rate swaps with fixed interest rates ranging from 2.008% to 2.1075% for a total notional amount of $150.0 to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates on future interest rate payments. The Company recorded a $17.9 mark-to-market gain in accumulated other comprehensive income on these swaps for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company entered into two swap contracts. Both contracts are ten-year interest rate swaps; the first swap has a notional amount of $50.0 with a fixed interest rate of 1.597%, while the second swap has a notional amount of $50.0 with a fixed interest rate of 1.821%. The Company recorded a $5.7 mark-to-market gain in accumulated other comprehensive income on these swaps for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company entered into a ten-year interest rate swap contract with a notional amount of $50.0 with a fixed interest rate of 1.4918%. The Company recorded a $7.0 mark-to-market gain to accumulated other comprehensive income on this swap for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company entered into multiple ten-year interest rate swap contracts with a cumulative total notional amount of $150.0 with fixed interest rates ranging from 1.64750% to 1.7460%. The Company recorded a $16.2 mark-to-market gain to accumulated other comprehensive income on these swaps for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company has recorded through other comprehensive income a cumulative mark-to-market net asset of $63.6 on open swaps. The Companys and Spire Missouris exchange-traded/cleared derivative instruments consist primarily of NYMEX and ICE positions. The NYMEX is the primary national commodities exchange on which natural gas derivatives are traded. Open NYMEX and ICE natural gas futures and swap positions at September 30, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nGas Marketing\nNotional (MMBtu millions)\nMaximum Term (Months)\nNotional (MMBtu millions)\nMaximum Term (Months)\nNatural gas futures purchased\n76.3 54 103.3 51\nNatural gas options purchased, net\n3.7 12 7.1 15\nNatural gas basis swaps purchased\n61.7 39 101.7 27\nGas Utility\nNatural gas futures purchased\n13.0 12 52.8 12\nAt September 30, 2022, Spire Missouri also had 23.4 MMBtu of other price mitigation in price mitigation in place through the use of NYMEX natural gas option-based strategies.\nDerivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions are recognized on the balance sheets of the Company at fair value, and the change in fair value of the effective portion of these hedge instruments is recorded, net of income tax, in other comprehensive income or loss (OCI). Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (AOCI) is a component of Total Common Stock Equity. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI into earnings when the hedged items affect net income, using the same revenue or expense category that the hedged item impacts. Based on market prices at September 30, 2022, it is expected that an immaterial amount of unrealized gains will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of Income of the Company during the next twelve months.

The objective of this policy is to limit Spire Missouris exposure to natural gas price volatility and to manage, hedge and mitigate substantial price risk. This policy strictly prohibits speculation and permits Spire Missouri to hedge current physical natural gas purchase commitments or forecasted or anticipated future peak (maximum) physical need for natural gas delivered. Costs and cost reductions, including carrying costs, associated with Spire Missouris use of natural gas derivative instruments are allowed to be passed on to Spire Missouri customers through the operation of its PGA clause, through which the MoPSC allows Spire Missouri to recover gas supply costs, subject to prudence review by the MoPSC. Accordingly, Spire Missouri does not expect any adverse earnings impact as a result of the use of these derivative instruments.\nSpire Missouri does not designate these instruments as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes because gains or losses associated with the use of these derivative instruments are deferred and recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, and, as a result, have no direct impact on the statements of income.\nThe timing of the operation of the PGA clause may cause interim variations in short-term cash flows, because Spire Missouri is subject to cash margin requirements associated with changes in the values of these instruments. Nevertheless, carrying costs associated with such requirements are recovered through the PGA clause.\nFrom time to time, Spire Missouri purchases NYMEX futures and options contracts to help stabilize operating costs associated with forecasted purchases of gasoline and diesel fuels used to power vehicles and equipment used in the course of its business. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions pursuant to ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The gains or losses on these derivative instruments are not subject to Spire Missouris PGA clause. At September 30, 2022, Spire Missouri had no gasoline futures contracts outstanding.\nDerivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions are recognized on the balance sheets at fair value and the change in the fair value of the effective portion of these hedge instruments is recorded, net of income tax, in OCI. AOCI is a component of Total Common Stock Equity. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI into earnings when the hedged items affect net income, using the same revenue or expense category that the hedged item impacts. As in both 2021 and 2020, there will be no reclassifications into the statements of income during fiscal 2023. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the items that are being hedged in the statements of cash flows.\nSpire Missouris derivative instruments consist primarily of NYMEX positions. The NYMEX is the primary national commodities exchange on which natural gas derivatives are traded. Open NYMEX natural gas futures positions at September 30, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nNotional (MMBtu millions)\nMaximum Term (Months)\nNotional (MMBtu millions)\nMaximum Term (Months)\nNatural gas futures purchased\n13.0 12 52.8 12\nAt September 30, 2022, Spire Missouri had also had 23.4 MMBtu of other price mitigation in place through the use of NYMEX natural gas option-based strategies.\nGains and losses on Spire Missouris natural gas derivative instruments, which are not designated as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes, are deferred pursuant to the Spire Missouris PGA clauses and initially recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. Such amounts are recognized in the statements of income as a component of natural gas operating expenses when they are recovered through the PGA clause and reflected in customer billings.\nFair Value of Derivative Instruments in the Balance Sheets\nDerivative Assets*\nDerivative Liabilities*\nSeptember 30, 2022\nBalance Sheet Location\nFair Value\nBalance Sheet Location\nFair Value\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments\nNatural gas contracts\nCurrent Assets: Other\n$ 57.8 Current Liabilities: Other\n$ 30.7\nSeptember 30, 2021\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments\nNatural gas contracts\nCurrent Assets: Other\n$ 104.0 Current Liabilities: Other\n$ 0.3\n*\nThe fair values of Derivative Assets and Derivative Liabilities exclude the fair value of cash margin receivables or payables with counterparties subject to netting arrangements.

The gains or losses on these derivative instruments are not subject to Spire Alabamas GSA rider. There were no such contracts outstanding as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\n11. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK\nSpires Gas Utility segment serves 1.7 million customers in three states across multiple rate classes resulting in a significant amount of revenue diversity. Credit risk is mitigated by the high percentage of residential customers as well as the geographic diversity of the Utilities, though customers for each of the Utilities are concentrated in a single state.\nSpire Marketings accounts receivable attributable to utility companies and their marketing affiliates totaled $245.6 at September 30, 2022. The concentration of transactions with these counterparties has the potential to affect the Companys overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that customers in this group may be affected similarly by changes in economic, industry, or other conditions. Spire Marketing also has concentrations of credit risk with certain individually significant counterparties. At September 30, 2022, the amounts included in accounts receivable from its five largest counterparties (in terms of net accounts receivable exposure) totaled $111.2. Four of these five counterparties are investment-grade rated integrated utilities, while the fifth is rated slightly below investment-grade, but with a stable outlook.\nTo manage these risks, Spire Marketing has established procedures to determine the creditworthiness of its counterparties. These procedures include obtaining credit ratings and credit reports, analyzing counterparty financial statements to assess financial condition, and considering the industry environment in which the counterparty operates. This information is monitored on an ongoing basis. In some instances, Spire Marketing may require credit assurances such as prepayments, letters of credit, or parental guaranties. In addition, Spire Marketing may enter into netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk with counterparties in the energy industry with whom it conducts both sales and purchases of natural gas. Where there is no netting arrangement, Spire Marketing records accounts receivable, accounts payable, and prepayments for physical sales and purchases of natural gas on a gross basis. Sales are typically made on an unsecured credit basis with payment due the month following delivery. Accounts receivable amounts are closely monitored and provisions for uncollectible amounts are accrued when losses are probable.\n12. INCOME TAXES\nThe Company, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama are subject to federal income tax as well as income tax in various state and local jurisdictions. Spire files a consolidated federal income tax return and various state income tax returns and allocates income taxes to Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and its other subsidiaries as if each entity were a separate taxpayer.\nThe provision for income taxes during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was as follows:\nSpire\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Alabama\nFederal:\nCurrent\n$ 0.5 $ 0.2 $ 0.4 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ -\nDeferred\n47.0 49.5 5.8 18.2 22.0 14.9 18.1 19.8 17.4\nInvestment tax credits\n(0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) - - -\nState and local:\nCurrent\n0.5 1.3 3.0 - - 0.1 - - -\nDeferred\n11.1 17.7 3.4 3.3 3.5 2.5 5.1 5.2 4.6\nTotal income tax expense\n$ 58.9 $ 68.5 $ 12.4 $ 21.3 $ 25.3 $ 17.3 $ 23.2 $ 25.0 $ 22.0\nThe effective income tax rate varied from the federal statutory income tax rate for each year due to the following:\nSpire\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Alabama\nFederal income tax statutory rate\n21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState and local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefits\n3.6 3.6 9.0 2.6 2.6 2.6 4.1 4.1 4.1\nCertain expenses capitalized on books and deducted on tax return\n(1.6 ) (1.6 ) (6.6 ) (3.2 ) (3.3 ) (4.6 ) - - -\nTaxes related to prior years\n(0.3 ) (0.5 ) (1.8 ) (0.6 ) (0.2 ) (1.4 ) - - 0.1\nAmortization of excess deferred taxes\n(3.5 ) (2.5 ) (8.3 ) (7.3 ) (5.0 ) (5.7 ) - - -\nOther items - net *\n1.9 0.1 (1.0 ) 3.1 (0.2 ) (0.2 ) 0.2 0.2 (0.1 )\nEffective income tax rate\n21.1 % 20.1 % 12.3 % 15.6 % 14.9 % 11.7 % 25.3 % 25.3 % 25.1 %\n*\nOther consists primarily of property adjustments.\nThe significant items comprising the net deferred tax liability or asset as of September 30 were as follows:\nSpire\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Alabama\nDeferred tax assets:\nReserves not currently deductible\n$ 33.5 $ 18.3 $ 4.0 $ 8.5 $ 7.4 $ 6.6\nPension and other postretirement benefits\n72.6 77.4 52.6 53.4 - -\nGoodwill\n- - - - 73.0 87.2\nOperating losses\n255.1 264.5 116.9 110.3 140.3 130.3\nRegulatory amount due to customers, net\n34.5 33.2 30.7 29.4 - -\nOther\n24.9 32.4 - - - -\nDeferred tax assets\n420.6 425.8 204.2 201.6 220.7 224.1\nLess: Valuation allowance\n- (0.5 ) - (0.4 ) - -\nTotal deferred tax assets\n420.6 425.3 204.2 201.2 220.7 224.1\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nRelating to property\n(740.0 ) (693.9 ) (489.3 ) (464.0 ) (201.6 ) (182.7 )\nRegulatory pension and other postretirement benefits\n(92.8 ) (95.6 ) (72.3 ) (71.2 ) (1.6 ) (1.6 )\nDeferred gas costs\n(75.8 ) (81.1 ) (74.0 ) (79.5 ) - -\nOther**\n(187.1 ) (167.0 ) (68.7 ) (66.5 ) (6.5 ) (5.6 )\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(1,095.7 ) (1,037.6 ) (704.3 ) (681.2 ) (209.7 ) (189.9 )\nNet deferred tax (liability) asset\n$ (675.1 ) $ (612.3 ) $ (500.1 ) $ (480.0 ) $ 11.0 $ 34.2\n**\nFor Spire, Other consists primarily of goodwill-related liabilities.\nAs indicated in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Companys regulated operations accounting for income taxes is impacted by ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) reduced the corporate federal income tax rate, and the corresponding reductions in deferred income tax balances resulted in amounts previously collected from utility customers for these deferred taxes becoming refundable to such customers, generally through reductions in future rates. The TCJA includes provisions that stipulate how these excess deferred taxes are to be passed back to customers for certain accelerated tax depreciation benefits. In fiscal 2018, the MoPSC Amended Report and Order took effect and the estimated excess accumulated deferred income tax began to be returned to Spire Missouri customers in rates. During the current fiscal year, the amount of excess accumulated deferred income taxes was trued up as part of the rate proceeding. The amount being returned related to the TCJA has been updated and in addition the excess accumulated deferred income taxes related to the Missouri tax rate change has begun to be returned. Excess accumulated deferred taxes of $9.9 were returned in fiscal 2022 and $8.4 were returned by Spire Missouri during each of fiscal years 2021, and 2020. The treatment for accumulated deferred income tax balances for Spire Alabama, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi is yet to be determined by state regulators; however, discussions have begun with respect to these balances.\nIn assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management considers all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years, the timing of deferred tax liability reversals, projected future taxable income, taxable income in carryback years, and tax planning strategies to assess the need for a valuation allowance. Based upon this evidence, management believes it is more likely than not the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets.\nAs of September 30, 2022, Spire, and on a separate company basis, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, had federal and state loss carryforwards, contribution carryforwards, and various tax credit carryforwards as shown below.\nSpire\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Alabama\nFederal and state loss carryforwards\n$ 1,047.7 $ 462.3 $ 556.7\nContribution carryforwards\n10.4 7.0 0.4\nTax credit carryforwards\n4.6 3.4 -\nFor federal tax purposes, Spire Missouris and Spire Alabamas loss carryforwards may be utilized against income from another member of the consolidated group. The loss carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal 2030 for certain state purposes and fiscal 2035 for federal and other state purposes. Contribution carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards are expected to be utilized prior to their expiration.\nThe Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama recognize the tax benefit from a tax position only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Unrecognized tax benefits are reported as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for an operating loss carryforward to the extent the recognition of the benefit would impact the operating loss carryforward, pursuant to ASU 2013-11. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of unrecognized tax benefits:\nSpire\nSpire Missouri\nUnrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year\n$ 16.4 $ 13.2 $ 10.7 $ 16.1 $ 13.0 $ 10.4\nIncreases related to tax positions taken in current year\n3.3 3.2 2.6 3.2 3.1 2.6\nReductions due to lapse of applicable statute of limitations\n(0.1 ) - (0.1 ) - - -\nUnrecognized tax benefits, end of year\n$ 19.6 $ 16.4 $ 13.2 $ 19.3 $ 16.1 $ 13.0\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate were $4.0 and $3.6, respectively, for the Company and $3.7 and $3.3, respectively, for Spire Missouri. It is reasonably possible that events will occur in the next 12 months that could increase or decrease the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits. The Company and Spire Missouri do not expect that any such change will be significant to the balance sheets. Spire Alabama reported no unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nThe Company, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama record potential interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as interest expense and other income deductions, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, interest accrued associated with uncertain tax positions was de minimis, and no penalties were accrued.\nThe Company, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama are no longer subject to examination for fiscal years prior to 2019, except to the extent the net operating losses from prior years are reviewed.\n13. PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nPension Plans\nThe pension plans of Spire consist of plans for employees at Spire Missouri, the employees of Spire Alabama and employees of the subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth.\nSpire Missouri and Spire Alabama have non-contributory, defined benefit, trusteed forms of pension plans covering the majority of their employees. Plan assets consist primarily of corporate and U.S. government obligations and a growth segment consisting of exposure to equity markets, commodities, real estate and international credit markets.\nThe net periodic pension cost includes components shown in the following table. The components other than the service costs and regulatory adjustment are presented in Other Income, Net in the income statement, except for Spire Alabamas losses on lump-sum settlements. Such losses are capitalized in regulatory balances and amortized over the remaining actuarial life of individuals in the plan, and that amortization is presented in Other Income, Net.\nSpire\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Alabama\nService cost - benefits earned during the period\n$ 20.0 $ 21.7 $ 22.5 $ 14.4 $ 15.4 $ 15.7 $ 4.8 $ 5.5 $ 6.1\nInterest cost on projected benefit obligation\n21.5\n20.7 22.6 14.7 14.2 15.8 4.7 4.6 4.9\nExpected return on plan assets\n(31.3 ) (31.6 ) (35.0 ) (22.7 ) (22.5 ) (24.6 ) (5.2 ) (5.8 ) (6.9 )\nAmortization of prior service (credit) cost\n(4.5 ) (3.1 ) (2.5 ) (1.9 ) (0.6 ) 0.1 (2.4 ) (2.3 ) (2.4 )\nAmortization of actuarial loss\n11.9 14.9 14.4 9.6 11.0 11.3 2.4 3.9 3.1\nLoss on lump-sum settlements and curtailments\n33.6 18.2 31.6 27.3 11.6 26.6 6.3 6.6 5.0\nSubtotal\n51.2 40.8 53.6 41.4 29.1 44.9 10.6 12.5 9.8\nRegulatory adjustment\n12.5\n20.6 6.6 9.9 19.0 3.9 1.7 0.7 1.8\nNet pension cost\n$ 63.7 $ 61.4 $ 60.2 $ 51.3 $ 48.1 $ 48.8 $ 12.3 $ 13.2 $ 11.6\nOther changes in plan assets and pension benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income or loss include the following:\nSpire\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Alabama\nCurrent year actuarial (gain) loss\n$ (16.9 ) $ (8.1 ) $ 68.0 $ 0.9 $ (0.9 ) $ 37.8 $ (16.0 ) $ (1.5 ) $ 24.4\nAmortization of actuarial loss\n(11.9 ) (14.9 ) (14.4 ) (9.6 ) (11.0 ) (11.3 ) (2.4 ) (3.9 ) (3.1 )\nAcceleration of loss recognized due to settlement\n(33.6 ) (18.2 ) (31.7 ) (27.3 ) (11.6 ) (26.6 ) (6.3 ) (6.6 ) (5.1 )\nCurrent year service credit\n- (17.9 ) (4.4 ) - (17.9 ) (4.4 ) - - -\nAmortization of prior service credit (cost)\n4.5 3.1 2.5 1.9 0.6 (0.1 ) 2.4 2.3 2.4\nSubtotal\n(57.9 ) (56.0 ) 20.0 (34.1 ) (40.8 ) (4.6 ) (22.3 ) (9.7 ) 18.6\nRegulatory adjustment\n56.3 57.3 (19.5 ) 32.5 42.1 5.1 22.3 9.7 (18.6 )\nTotal recognized in OCI\n$ (1.6 ) $ 1.3 $ 0.5 $ (1.6 ) $ 1.3 $ 0.5 $ - $ - $ -\nSpire pension obligations are driven by separate plan and regulatory provisions governing Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and Spire EnergySouth pension plans.\nPursuant to the provisions of Spire Missouris and Spire Alabamas pension plans, pension obligations may be satisfied by monthly annuities, lump-sum cash payments, or special termination benefits. Lump-sum payments are recognized as settlements (which can result in gains or losses) only if the total of such payments exceeds the sum of service and interest costs in a specific year. Special termination benefits, when offered, are also recognized as settlements which can result in gains or losses.\nIn the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, two Spire Missouri plans and two Spire Alabama plans met the criteria for settlement recognition, requiring re-measurement of the obligation under those plans using updated census data and assumptions for discount rate and mortality. For the remeasurements, the discount rates for the Missouri plans were updated to 5.7% and 5.8%, respectfully, for each plan at September 30, 2022 (from 3.0%, respectfully, at September 30, 2021), and the discount rate for the Alabama plans were updated to 5.70% and 5.65%, respectfully, (from 3.1% and 3.0%, respectfully). Lump-sum payments recognized as settlements during fiscal year 2022 was $109.3 ($87.0 attributable to Spire Missouri and $22.3 to Spire Alabama). The Alabama regulatory tariff requires that settlement losses be amortized over the remaining actuarial life of the individuals in the plan, and in fiscal 2022 the amortization periods range from 11.4 years to 12.3 years. Therefore, no lump sum settlement expenses were recorded in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nIn the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, two Spire Missouri plans and one Spire Alabama plan met the criteria for settlement recognition, requiring re-measurement of the obligation under those plans using updated census data and assumptions for discount rate and mortality. For the remeasurements, the discount rates for the Missouri plans were updated to 3.00% at September 30, 2021 (from 2.85% at September 30, 2020), and the discount rate for the Alabama plan was updated to 3.10% (from 2.95%). Lump-sum payments recognized as settlements during fiscal year 2021 was $67.5 ($44.6 attributable to Spire Missouri and $22.9 to Spire Alabama). The Alabama regulatory tariff requires that settlement losses be amortized over the remaining actuarial life of the individuals in the plan, and in fiscal 2021 the amortization periods range from 11.4 years to 11.7 years. Therefore, no lump sum settlement expenses were recorded in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021.\nEffective December 23, 2021, the pension cost for Spire Missouris western territory (Missouri West) included in customer rates was reduced from $5.5 to $4.4 per year, the pension cost included in Spire Missouris eastern territory (Missouri East) customer rates was increased from $29.0 to $32.4 per year. The difference between these amounts and pension expense as calculated pursuant to the above and that otherwise would be included in the statements of income and statements of comprehensive income is deferred as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability.\nAlso effective December 23, 2021, Missouri East prepaid pension assets and other postretirement benefits that were previously being included in rates at $21.6 per year for eight years were reduced to $11.0 per year, with the amortization period being reset for another eight years. Missouri West net liability for pension and other postretirement benefits that were previously reducing rates by $3.3 per year for eight years were reduced to a $1.1 reduction in rates per year, with the amortization period being reset for another eight years.\nThe following table shows the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the pension benefit obligation at September 30:\nSpire\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Alabama\nBenefit obligation, beginning of year\n$ 689.6 $ 732.6 $ 479.0 $ 505.2 $ 149.4 $ 163.5\nService cost\n20.0 21.7 14.4 15.4 4.8 5.5\nInterest cost\n21.5\n20.7 14.7 14.2 4.7 4.6\nActuarial (gain) loss\n(173.9 ) 6.6 (116.2 ) 11.0 (42.4 ) (1.8 )\nPlan amendments\n- (17.9 ) - (17.9 ) - -\nSettlement loss\n33.4 12.3 27.9 8.2 5.6 4.1\nSettlement benefits paid\n(109.3 ) (67.6 ) (87.0 ) (44.6 ) (22.3 ) (22.9 )\nRegular benefits paid\n(16.9 ) (18.8 ) (12.2 ) (12.5 ) (2.0 ) (3.6 )\nBenefit obligation, end of year\n$ 464.4 $ 689.6 $ 320.6 $ 479.0 $ 97.8 $ 149.4\nAccumulated benefit obligation, end of year\n$ 457.1 $ 673.3 $ 315.0 $ 465.4 $ 96.2 $ 146.9\nIn 2022, all qualified plans experienced significant actuarial gains. These gains were driven by the discount rates increasing between 2.55% and 2.80% compared to the prior fiscal year, combined with lump sum rates that increased significantly since the prior fiscal year, which decreased the liability and contributed to liability gains. These gains were only partly offset by the losses on actual lump sum benefit payments compared to assumed amounts across all the plans. Actuarial losses 2021 were primarily due to the decrease in lump sum discount rates in one Spire Missouri plan and the losses on actual lump sum benefit payments compared to assumed amounts across all the plans. Except for Spire Alabama in 2021, these losses more than offset the gains that resulted from the increase in discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations for each year.\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the fair value of plan assets at September 30:\nSpire\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Alabama\nFair value of plan assets, beginning of year\n$ 498.9 $ 473.1 $ 364.0 $ 336.2 $ 82.8 $ 88.6\nActual return on plan assets\n(92.5 ) 58.8 (66.7 ) 42.7 (15.6 ) 9.6\nEmployer contributions\n52.4 53.4 37.8 42.2 14.4 11.1\nSettlement benefits paid\n(109.3 ) (67.6 ) (87.0 ) (44.6 ) (22.3 ) (22.9 )\nRegular benefits paid\n(16.8 ) (18.8 ) (12.2 ) (12.5 ) (2.0 ) (3.6 )\nFair value of plan assets, end of year\n$ 332.7 $ 498.9 $ 235.9 $ 364.0 $ 57.3 $ 82.8\nFunded status of plans, end of year\n$ (131.7 ) $ (190.7 ) $ (84.7 ) $ (115.0 ) $ (40.5 ) $ (66.6 )\nThe following table sets forth the amounts recognized in the balance sheets at September 30:\nSpire\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Alabama\nCurrent liabilities\n$ (1.1 ) $ (0.8 ) $ (1.1 ) $ (0.8 ) $ - $ -\nNoncurrent liabilities\n(130.6 ) (189.9 ) (83.6 ) (114.2 ) (40.5 ) (66.6 )\nTotal\n$ (131.7 ) $ (190.7 ) $ (84.7 ) $ (115.0 ) $ (40.5 ) $ (66.6 )\nPre-tax amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss not yet recognized as components of net periodic pension cost consist of:\nSpire\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Alabama\nNet actuarial loss\n$ 132.0 $ 194.6 $ 93.6 $ 129.6 $ 41.2 $ 66.1\nPrior service credit\n(35.7 ) (40.3 ) (18.1 ) (20.1 ) (16.3 ) (18.7 )\nSubtotal\n96.3 154.3 75.5 109.5 24.9 47.4\nAdjustments for amounts included in regulatory assets\n(93.1 ) (149.5 ) (72.3 ) (104.7 ) (24.9 ) (47.4 )\nTotal\n$ 3.2 $ 4.8 $ 3.2 $ 4.8 $ - $ -\nThe assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension costs for Spire Missouri are as follows:\nWeighted average discount rate - Spire Missouri East plan\n3.00%\n2.85%\n3.20%\nWeighted average discount rate - Spire Missouri West plan\n3.00%\n2.75%\n3.15%\nWeighted average rate of future compensation increase\n3.00%\n3.00%\n3.00%\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets\n6.75%\n6.75%\n7.25%\nThe assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension costs for Spire Alabama are as follows:\nWeighted average discount rate\n3.10%/3.0%\n2.95%/2.80%\n3.25%/3.20%\nWeighted average rate of future compensation increase\n3.00%\n3.00%\n3.00%\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets\n6.75%\n6.75%\n7.25%\nThe discount rate is based on long-term, high quality bond indices at the measurement date.

Retirement Plans Committee is responsible for the administration of the various plans, and all payments under the plans require direction of that committee. The Spire Inc. Defined Benefit Plan Investment Review Committee utilizes an Outsourced Chief Investment Officer (OCIO) model where investment decisions are outsourced to investment consultants (Willis Towers Watson), who in turn become co-fiduciaries with the committee.\nFor all plans, the Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets with a prudent level of risk. Risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, corporate financial condition and market conditions. The Company has developed an investment strategy that focuses on asset allocation, diversification and quality guidelines. The investment goals are to obtain an adequate level of return to meet future obligations of the plan by providing above average risk-adjusted returns with a risk exposure in the mid-range of comparable funds. Comparative market and peer group benchmarks are utilized to ensure that investment managers are performing satisfactorily. The Company seeks to maintain an appropriate level of diversification to minimize the risk of large losses in a single asset class. Accordingly, plan assets for the pension plans do not have a concentration of assets in a single entity, industry, country, commodity or class of investment fund.\nThe following table sets forth expected pension benefit payments for the succeeding five fiscal years, and in aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter, for Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama:\n2028- 2032\nSpire\n$ 55.8 $ 52.3 $ 47.2 $ 44.0 $ 43.5 $ 202.9\nSpire Missouri\n41.4 38.9 33.9 30.8 29.6 137.5\nSpire Alabama\n11.3 10.2 9.9 9.7 10.4 46.4\nThe funding policy of Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama is to contribute an amount not less than the minimum required by government funding standards nor more than the maximum deductible amount for federal income tax purposes. Spire Missouris contributions to the pension plans in fiscal 2023 are anticipated to be $44.5 into the qualified trusts, and $1.1 into the non-qualified plans. Spire Alabamas contributions to the pension plans in fiscal 2022 are anticipated to be $13.8 into the qualified trusts.\nOther Postretirement Benefits\nSpire and the Utilities provide certain life insurance benefits at retirement. Spire Missouri plans provide for medical insurance after early retirement until age 65. For retirements prior to January 1, 2015, the Missouri West plans provided medical insurance after retirement until death. The Spire Alabama plans provide medical insurance upon retirement until death for certain retirees depending on the type of employee and the date the employee was originally hired.\nNet periodic postretirement benefit costs consist of the following components:\nSpire\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Alabama\nService cost - benefits earned during the period\n$ 7.5 $ 7.3 $ 5.9 $ 6.3 $ 6.2 $ 5.3 $ 1.1 $ 0.9 $ 0.4\nInterest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation\n6.0 6.0 6.3 4.5 4.5 4.7 1.4 1.3 1.4\nExpected return on plan assets\n(16.8 ) (16.1 ) (16.7 ) (11.3 ) (10.9 ) (11.4 ) (5.2 ) (4.9 ) (5.0 )\nAmortization of prior service cost (credit)\n1.0 1.0 (0.5 ) 0.7 0.7 (0.2 ) 0.3 0.3 (0.3 )\nAmortization of actuarial gain\n(2.2 ) (1.6 ) (2.0 ) (1.9 ) (1.5 ) (2.0 ) - - -\nSubtotal\n(4.5 ) (3.4 ) (7.0 ) (1.7 ) (1.0 ) (3.6 ) (2.4 ) (2.4 ) (3.5 )\nRegulatory adjustment\n3.3 13.2 16.0 5.0 15.0 17.7 (1.8 ) (1.8 ) (1.8 )\nNet postretirement benefit (income) cost\n$ (1.2 ) $ 9.8 $ 9.0 $ 3.3 $ 14.0 $ 14.1 $ (4.2 ) $ (4.2 ) $ (5.3 )\nOther changes in plan assets and postretirement benefit obligations recognized in OCI include the following:\nSpire\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Alabama\nCurrent year actuarial loss (gain)\n$ 15.8 $ (41.0 ) $ (7.3 ) $ 9.8 $ (29.0 ) $ (7.6 ) $ 5.9 $ (9.9 ) $ 1.1\nAmortization of actuarial gain\n2.2 1.6 2.0 1.9 1.5 2.0 - - -\nCurrent year prior service (cost) credit\n(6.3 ) - 15.8 (1.1 ) - 9.5 (5.2 ) - 6.3\nAmortization of prior service (cost) credit\n(1.0 ) (1.0 ) 0.5 (0.7 ) (0.7 ) 0.2 (0.3 ) (0.3 ) 0.3\nSubtotal\n10.7 (40.4 ) 11.0 9.9 (28.2 ) 4.1 0.4 (10.2 ) 7.7\nRegulatory adjustment\n(10.7 ) 40.4 (11.0 ) (9.9 ) 28.2 (4.1 ) (0.4 ) 10.2 (7.7 )\nTotal recognized in OCI\n$ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ -\nPursuant to a MoPSC Order, the return on plan assets is based on the market-related value of plan assets implemented prospectively over a four-year period. Gains and losses not yet includible in postretirement benefit cost are amortized only to the extent that such gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. Such excess is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. Effective April 18, 2018, the recovery in rates for Spire Missouris postretirement benefit plans is based on an annual allowance of $8.6. The difference between these amounts and postretirement benefit cost based on the above and that otherwise would be included in the statements of income and statements of comprehensive income is deferred as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability.\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the postretirement benefit obligation at September 30:\nSpire\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Alabama\nBenefit obligation, beginning of year\n$ 204.2 $ 212.3 $ 151.7 $ 158.4 $ 48.0 $ 48.3\nService cost\n7.5 7.3 6.3 6.2 1.1 0.9\nInterest cost\n6.0 6.0 4.5 4.5 1.4 1.3\nActuarial (gain) loss\n(52.6 ) (7.5 ) (37.7 ) (6.7 ) (13.6 ) 0.7\nPlan amendments\n(6.2 ) - (1.0 ) - (5.2 ) -\nRetiree drug subsidy program\n0.2 - 0.2 - - -\nBenefits paid\n(11.0 ) (13.9 ) (9.2 ) (10.7 ) (1.8 ) (3.2 )\nBenefit obligation, end of year\n$ 148.1 $ 204.2 $ 114.8 $ 151.7 $ 29.9 $ 48.0\nIn fiscal 2022, the actuarial gains for all qualified Spire plans were driven by the increase in the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligation.

The Utilities have established Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association and Rabbi Trusts as external funding mechanisms. Their investment policies seek to maximize investment returns consistent with their tolerance for risk. Outside investment management specialists are utilized in each asset class. Such specialists are provided with guidelines, where appropriate, designed to ensure that the investment portfolio is managed in accordance with policy. Performance and compliance with the guidelines is regularly monitored. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama currently invest in mutual funds which are rebalanced periodically to the target allocation. The mutual funds are diversified across U.S. stock and bond markets, and for Spire Alabama, international stock markets.\nThe following table sets forth expected postretirement benefit payments for the succeeding five fiscal years, and in aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter for Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama:\n2028 - 2032\nSpire\n$ 13.7 $ 14.4 $ 14.6 $ 14.5 $ 14.7 $ 69.5\nSpire Missouri\n11.6 12.2 12.3 12.2 12.2 55.7\nSpire Alabama\n1.9 2.0 2.1 2.1 2.2 11.9\nThe Utilities funding policy is to contribute amounts to the trusts equal to the periodic benefit cost calculated pursuant to GAAP as recovered in rates. For both Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama there are no anticipated contributions to the postretirement plans in fiscal 2023.\nOther Plans\nSpire Services Inc. sponsors a 401(k) plan that cover substantially all employees of Spire Inc. and its subsidiaries.

INFORMATION BY OPERATING SEGMENT\nThe Company has two reportable segments: Gas Utility and Gas Marketing. The Gas Utility segment is the aggregation of the operations of the Utilities. The Gas Marketing segment includes the results of Spire Marketing, a subsidiary engaged in the non-regulated marketing of natural gas and related activities, including utilizing natural gas storage contracts for providing natural gas sales. Other components of the Companys consolidated information include:\nSpire STL Pipeline, a subsidiary of Spire providing interstate natural gas pipeline transportation services;\nSpire Storage, a subsidiary of Spire providing interstate natural gas storage services;\nSpires subsidiaries engaged in the operation of a propane pipeline and risk management, among other activities; and\nunallocated corporate items, including certain debt and associated interest costs.\nAccounting policies are described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Intersegment transactions include sales of natural gas from Spire Marketing to Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, sales of natural gas from Spire Missouri to Spire Marketing, sales of natural gas from Spire Alabama to Spire Marketing, propane transportation services provided by Spire NGL Inc. to Spire Missouri, and propane storage services provided by Spire Missouri to Spire NGL Inc.\nManagement evaluates the performance of the operating segments based on the computation of net economic earnings. Net economic earnings exclude from reported net income the after-tax impacts of fair value accounting and timing adjustments associated with energy-related transactions, the impacts of acquisition, divestiture and restructuring activities, and the largely non-cash impacts of other non-recurring or unusual items such as certain regulatory, legislative or GAAP standard-setting actions.\nGas Gas\nUtility\nMarketing\nOther\nEliminations\nConsolidated\nRevenues from external customers\n$ 1,945.6 $ 234.9 $ 18.0 $ - $ 2,198.5\nIntersegment revenues\n0.5 - 51.2 (51.7 ) -\nTotal Operating Revenues\n1,946.1 234.9 69.2 (51.7 ) 2,198.5\nOperating Expenses\nNatural gas\n788.8 171.4 - (36.3 ) 923.9\nOther operation and maintenance\n413.3 14.6 37.1 (15.4 ) 449.6\nDepreciation and amortization\n227.9 1.4 8.0 - 237.3\nTaxes, other than income taxes\n176.2 0.6 2.7 - 179.5\nTotal Operating Expenses\n1,606.2 188.0 47.8 (51.7 ) 1,790.3\nOperating Income\n$ 339.9 $ 46.9 $ 21.4 $ - $ 408.2\nNet Economic Earnings (Loss)\n$ 202.7 $ 27.0 $ (13.4 ) $ - $ 216.3\nCapital Expenditures\n$ 528.6 $ 0.9 $ 22.7 $ - $ 552.2\nGas Gas\nUtility\nMarketing\nOther\nEliminations\nConsolidated\nRevenues from external customers\n$ 2,118.2 $ 96.5 $ 20.8 $ - $ 2,235.5\nIntersegment revenues\n1.1 - 46.9 (48.0 ) -\nTotal Operating Revenues\n2,119.3 96.5 67.7 (48.0 ) 2,235.5\nOperating Expenses\nNatural gas\n961.7 18.8 0.1 (34.3 ) 946.3\nOther operation and maintenance\n422.2 17.1 40.2 (13.7 ) 465.8\nDepreciation and amortization\n204.4 1.2 7.5 - 213.1\nTaxes, other than income taxes\n157.0 0.9 2.2 - 160.1\nImpairments\n- - - - -\nTotal Operating Expenses\n1,745.3 38.0 50.0 (48.0 ) 1,785.3\nOperating Income\n$ 374.0 $ 58.5 $ 17.7 $ - $ 450.2\nNet Economic Earnings (Loss)\n$ 230.6 $ 47.0 $ (11.3 ) $ - $ 266.3\nCapital Expenditures\n$ 590.4 $ 0.7 $ 33.7 $ - $ 624.8\nGas Gas\nUtility\nMarketing\nOther\nEliminations\nConsolidated\nRevenues from external customers\n$ 1,751.8 $ 87.9 $ 15.7 $ - $ 1,855.4\nIntersegment revenues\n0.2 - 42.1 (42.3 ) -\nTotal Operating Revenues\n1,752.0 87.9 57.8 (42.3 ) 1,855.4\nOperating Expenses\nNatural gas\n660.2 65.1 0.4 (29.6 ) 696.1\nOther operation and maintenance\n421.3 11.8 38.2 (12.7 ) 458.6\nDepreciation and amortization\n189.7 0.6 7.0 - 197.3\nTaxes, other than income taxes\n146.5 1.1 0.8 - 148.4\nImpairments\n- - 148.6 - 148.6\nTotal Operating Expenses\n1,417.7 78.6 195.0 (42.3 ) 1,649.0\nOperating Income (Loss)\n$ 334.3 $ 9.3 $ (137.2 ) $ - $ 206.4\nNet Economic Earnings (Loss)\n$ 213.4 $ 9.1 $ (14.7 ) $ - $ 207.8\nCapital Expenditures\n$ 547.8 $ 3.6 $ 87.0 $ - $ 638.4\nTotal Assets at End of Year\nGas Utility\n$ 8,042.8 $ 7,615.4 $ 6,716.2\nGas Marketing\n638.7 466.1 182.7\nOther\n2,895.2 2,351.7 2,443.5\nEliminations\n(1,493.0 ) (1,076.8 ) (1,101.2 )\nTotal Assets\n$ 10,083.7 $ 9,356.4 $ 8,241.2\nReconciliation of Consolidated Net Income to Consolidated Net Economic Earnings\nNet Income\n$ 220.8 $ 271.7 $ 88.6\nAdjustments, pre-tax:\nImpairments\n- - 148.6\nMissouri regulatory adjustments\n- (9.0 ) -\nFair value and timing adjustments\n(11.4 ) 3.3 2.5\nAcquisition, divestiture and restructuring activities\n- (1.3 ) -\nIncome tax effect of adjustments\n6.9 1.6 (31.9 )\nNet Economic Earnings\n$ 216.3 $ 266.3 $ 207.8\n15. REGULATORY MATTERS\nAs discussed below for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, the Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clauses and Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) riders allow the Utilities to pass through to customers the cost of purchased gas supplies. Regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities related to the PGA clauses and the GSA rider are both labeled Unamortized Purchased Gas Adjustments herein.\nThe following regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities were reflected in the Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nSpire\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Alabama\nSeptember 30\nRegulatory Assets:\nCurrent:\nPension and postretirement benefit costs\n$ - $ 31.1 $ - $ 21.9 $ - $ 8.2\nUnamortized purchased gas adjustments\n322.2 243.5 275.1 242.8 43.8 -\nOther\n33.2 31.9 13.0 11.6 13.1 10.6\nTotal Current Regulatory Assets\n355.4 306.5 288.1 276.3 56.9 18.8\nNoncurrent:\nFuture income taxes due from customers\n137.8 132.9 129.2 124.2 2.2 2.2\nPension and postretirement benefit costs\n294.5 313.8 222.9 226.0 66.5 82.9\nCost of removal\n493.7 431.9 25.2 34.9 468.5 397.0\nEnergy efficiency\n57.2 47.6 57.2 47.6 - -\nOther\n129.2 67.3 113.1 50.4 1.0 1.2\nTotal Noncurrent Regulatory Assets\n1,112.4 993.5 547.6 483.1 538.2 483.3\nTotal Regulatory Assets\n$ 1,467.8 $ 1,300.0 $ 835.7 $ 759.4 $ 595.1 $ 502.1\nRegulatory Liabilities:\nCurrent:\nPension and postretirement benefit costs\n$ - $ 5.8 $ - $ 3.6 $ - $ 2.2\nUnamortized purchased gas adjustments\n- 11.0 - - - 10.2\nOther\n3.7 17.8 - 13.5 - 1.0\nTotal Current Regulatory Liabilities\n3.7 34.6 - 17.1 - 13.4\nNoncurrent:\nDeferred taxes due to customers\n145.3 127.5 127.9 110.2 - -\nPension and postretirement benefit costs\n172.6 159.3 143.6 131.4 19.4 19.8\nAccrued cost of removal\n32.9 36.2 - 4.9 - -\nUnamortized purchased gas adjustments\n53.0 284.3 53.0 284.3 - -\nOther\n14.4 13.6 7.3 8.0 3.6 3.6\nTotal Noncurrent Regulatory Liabilities\n418.2 620.9 331.8 538.8 23.0 23.4\nTotal Regulatory Liabilities\n$ 421.9 $ 655.5 $ 331.8 $ 555.9 $ 23.0 $ 36.8\nA portion of the Companys regulatory assets are not earning a return and are shown in the schedule below:\nSpire\nSpire Missouri\nSeptember 30\nPension and postretirement benefit costs\n$ 152.9 $ 165.7 $ 152.9 $ 165.7\nFuture income taxes due from customers\n135.6 130.7 129.2 124.2\nUnamortized purchase gas adjustments\n275.1 242.8 275.1 242.8\nOther\n122.7 86.0 122.7 86.0\nTotal Regulatory Assets Not Earning a Return\n$ 686.3 $ 625.2 $ 679.9 $ 618.7\nLike all the Companys regulatory assets, these regulatory assets are expected to be recovered from customers in future rates. The recovery period for the future income taxes due from customers and pension and other postretirement benefit costs could be 20 years or longer, based on current Internal Revenue Service guidelines and average remaining service life of active participants, respectively. The recovery period for the PGA assets is normally about one year, but a portion will be three years due to the Filing Adjustment Factor discussed below. The other items not earning a return are expected to be recovered over a period not to exceed 15 years, consistent with precedent set by the MoPSC, except for certain debt costs expected to be recovered over the related debt term, up to 35 years. Spire Alabama does not have any regulatory assets that are not earning a return.\nSpire Missouri\nAs authorized by the MoPSC, the PGA clause allows Spire Missouri to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the MoPSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies. To better match customer billings with market natural gas prices, Spire Missouri is allowed to file to modify, on a periodic basis, the level of gas costs in its PGA. Certain provisions of the PGA clause are included below:\nSpire Missouri has a risk management policy that allows for the purchase of natural gas derivative instruments with the goal of managing price risk associated with purchasing natural gas on behalf of its customers. The MoPSC clarified that costs, cost reductions, and carrying costs associated with the Utilitys use of natural gas derivative instruments are gas costs recoverable through the PGA mechanism.\nThe tariffs allow Spire Missouri flexibility to make up to three discretionary PGA changes during each year, in addition to its mandatory November PGA change, so long as such changes are separated by at least two months.\nSpire Missouri is authorized to apply carrying costs to all over- or under-recoveries of gas costs, including costs and cost reductions associated with the use of derivative instruments, including cash payments for margin deposits.\nPre-tax income from off-system sales and capacity release revenues is shared with customers (such that customers receive 75% and Spire Missouri receives 25%), with an estimated amount assumed in PGA rates.\nPursuant to the provisions of the PGA clause, the difference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the PGA clause, as well as the difference between the actual amount of off-system sales and capacity release revenues allocated to customers and the estimated amount assumed in PGA rates, are reflected as a regulatory asset or liability at the end of the fiscal year. At that time, the balance is classified as a current asset or current liability and recovered from, or credited to, customers over an annual period commencing in the subsequent November. The balance in the current account is amortized as amounts are reflected in customer billings.\nOn March 7, 2018, the MoPSC issued its order in two general rate cases (docketed as GR-2017-0215 and GR-2017-0216), approving new tariffs that became effective on April 19, 2018. Certain provisions of the order allowed less future recovery of certain deferred or capitalized costs than estimated based upon previous rate proceedings, and management determined that the related regulatory assets should be written down. Spire Missouri filed an appeal of portions of the MoPSCs order, including the disallowance of certain pension costs. On February 9, 2021, the Missouri Supreme Court issued its decision, reversing the MoPSCs order with respect to certain pension costs. The case was remanded back to the MoPSC with directions that $9.0 in pension assets that accrued between 1994 and 1996 be added to the Companys prepaid pension asset. Based on the courts decision, the Company increased its noncurrent regulatory asset for Pension and postretirement benefit costs and reduced operation and maintenance expense for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Like the original write-down in 2018, this adjustment is excluded for the net economic earnings financial measure. The remand issue is being considered as part of Spire Missouris ongoing general rate case (discussed below).\nThe Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharge (ISRS) allows Spire Missouri expedited recovery for its investment to replace its worn out or deteriorated infrastructure without the necessity of a formal rate case. On November 19, 2019, the Missouri Western District Court of Appeals issued rulings (ISRS rulings) that determined certain capital investments in 2016 through 2018 were not eligible for recovery under the ISRS. As a result, Spire Missouri recorded a $12.2 provision for fiscal year 2019, which was excluded for the net economic earnings financial measure. This matter was settled by the end of fiscal 2020. On December 23, 2021, Spire Missouri filed a new ISRS case, its first under the ISRS statute amendments of 2020, seeking accelerated recovery of $11.3 in annual revenue for eligible pipe replacement from June through December 2021. On April 21, 2022, the MoPSC approved a settlement among the parties to resolve the ISRS case, resulting in $8.5 in incremental annual revenue effective in May 2022. On June 3, 2022, Spire Missouri filed a new ISRS case, its first with the inclusion of the \"Contractor Bid\" requirement identified in the ISRS statute amendments of 2020, seeking accelerated recovery of $11.9 in annual revenue for eligible pipe replacement from January through June 2022. On October 5, 2022, the MoPSC approved a settlement among the parties to resolve the ISRS case, resulting in $10.5 in incremental revenue effective October 21, 2022, bringing total annual ISRS revenue to $19.0.\nIn September 2020, Spire Missouri, the MoPSC staff and the Office of Public Counsel (OPC) reached a Unanimous Stipulation and Agreement regarding Spire Missouris request for an Accounting Authority Order (AAO) pertaining to certain costs and lost customer fee revenue related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2020, the MoPSC issued an order approving that agreement and granting an AAO for the period of March 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021. As part of the 2021 rate order discussed below, the settled balance of deferred costs, including foregone late payment fees and reconnect/disconnect fees that Spire Missouri was authorized to defer, totaled $6.2 and will be recovered through a five-year amortization of a regulatory asset.\nIn mid- February 2021, the central U.S. experienced a period of unusually severe cold weather (Winter Storm Uri), and Spire Missouri implemented an Operational Flow Order (OFO) to preserve the integrity of its distribution system. During this time, Spire Missouri was required to purchase additional natural gas supply, both to ensure adequate supply for its firm utility customers, and to cover the shortfall created when third-party marketers failed to deliver natural gas supply to its city gates on behalf of their customers. In accordance with its tariffs, Spire Missouri invoiced the cost of gas and associated penalties totaling $195.8 to non-compliant marketers pursuant to the MoPSC-approved OFO tariff and recorded accounts receivable. Recoveries collected will be an offset to cost of natural gas for firm utility customers through the PGA and Actual Cost Adjustment (ACA), so are net income neutral to Spire Missouri. The three largest counterparties did not remit payment when due, so Spire Missouri filed suit against them in federal court to recover the invoiced amounts. Some marketers filed complaints with the MoPSC requesting review of the transactions between them and Spire Missouri. Through the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company had no reason to believe the MoPSC would not follow the tariff and had determined collection was probable, so the entire amount was recognized. In late February 2022, the parties to the OFO waiver suits agreed to a settlement in principle, pursuant to which marketers will reimburse Spire Missouri for the actual cost of its incremental gas purchases to serve marketers customers during Winter Storm Uri, so Spire Missouri reduced revenue, accounts receivable, cost of gas and regulatory liabilities by approximately $150 in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The settlement, which reduced the total amount due from the three marketers to approximately $42, was approved by the MoPSC in late May 2022. Pursuant to the approved settlement, the marketers have begun making payments to Spire Missouri that will be credited to the PGA/ACA, the marketer complaints have been dismissed at the MoPSC, and Spire Missouri has dismissed its federal lawsuits against the marketers. Spire Missouri is not subject to any upstream OFO penalties on any interstate pipelines.\nAs a result of the significant net deferred gas costs and average inventory cost in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to Winter Storm Uri, Spire Missouri filed for and received MoPSC approval for an adjustment to the PGA tariff to increase a Filing Adjustment Factor (FAF) credit on customers' bills for three years. This helps customers by lowering the net PGA rate to mitigate impacts from Winter Storm Uri costs and the increased gas market from 2020 to 2021. All gas costs will eventually be recovered by Spire Missouri through the PGA or ACA mechanisms and carrying costs will be applied per the terms of the tariff.\nSpire Missouri is able to sell excess natural gas supply and capacity to third parties off-system, resulting in significant savings to its firm utility customers through the gas incentive mechanisms of its PGA as described above. Spire Missouri retains 25% and passes 75% through to its customers as gas cost savings. During Winter Storm Uri, Spire Missouri had an unusually large off-system sale resulting in $100.0 of incremental gross revenue. Due to the nature and magnitude of this particular transaction, Spire Missouri initially deferred recognition of its 25% share and established a regulatory liability to allow time to assess the transaction in light of the open rate proceeding. When the regulatory treatment became clear in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company reversed the liability and recorded the amount in operating revenues.\nThe MoPSC approved compliance tariffs with an effective date of December 23, 2021, in Spire Missouris general rate case GR-2021-0108. These new tariffs were designed to increase Spire Missouris aggregate annual gross base rate revenues by $72.2, which includes $24.9 incremental and $47.3 already being collected through the Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharge (ISRS). The decision, as reflected in the amended report and order dated November 12, 2021, revised the MoPSCs long-standing position regarding Spire Missouris compliance with the FERC Uniform System of Accounts (USOA) on the capitalization of prudently incurred non-operational overheads. The amended report and order required Spire Missouri to cease capitalization of these overhead costs at the time new rates went into effect until a MoPSC staff audit of their revised interpretation of compliance with the USOA framework could be completed. MoPSC staff completed this audit and filed its audit report on March 18, 2022. The report recommends changes to Spire Missouris overhead capitalization rates based upon its new time study and the results of the audit. On April 13, 2022, the MoPSC issued an Order Authorizing Accounting Treatment clarifying that Spire Missouri may defer all non-operational overheads from December 23, 2021 forward into a regulatory asset for future review by the MoPSC in an appropriate proceeding. Based on Spire Missouris assessment of recoverability, the total amount deferred under this order was $42.8 through September 30, 2022, comprising:\n$19.0 in accordance with new capitalization rates determined by the study and audit;\n$18.8 of prudent costs which are in excess of the capitalization rates determined by the study and audit; and\n$5.0 of prudent costs related to the April 2022 ISRS settlement discussed above.\nOn April 1, 2022, Spire Missouri filed tariff sheets to initiate a new general rate case proceeding which is intended to address the deferred amounts, along with other matters, and is expected to be resolved in the first half of fiscal 2023. The proposed tariff changes include revised rate schedules designed to produce an annual net increase in Spire Missouris gas revenues of approximately $151.9. Intervenor direct testimony was filed in late August and early September 2022. The MoPSC has set a test year ending September 30, 2021, adjusted for known and measurable rate base, revenue and expense items through May 31, 2022, with a true-up period through September 30, 2022. On October 7, 2022, Spire Missouri and various intervenors filed rebuttal testimony. MoPSC staff also filed updated accounting schedules reflecting a revised revenue requirement of $71.0. Local public hearings concluded in mid- October 2022. Following these hearings, the parties reached a Full Unanimous Stipulation and Agreement (the \"Stipulation\") to resolve all issues in the case which was filed with the MoPSC on November 4, 2022. A hearing regarding this Stipulation is currently set for November 18, 2022. The remainder of the procedural schedule has been suspended, pending MoPSC action on the Stipulation. If approved, the Stipulation would, among other things, authorize $78.0 in new base rate revenue (with rates effective no later than January 1, 2023), and authorize recovery of deferred overheads through amortization of the related regulatory assets discussed in the previous paragraph.\nOn May 27, 2022, the MoPSC staff filed an ACA Review Recommendation and Report for the ACA period that first includes transportation charges incurred by Spire Missouri for service on the Spire STL Pipeline. That report concluded that the transaction complied with Missouri affiliate transaction rules and was prudent, and it recommended no disallowance of any Spire STL Pipeline related costs from the ACA mechanism. On July 11, 2022, Spire Missouri filed its response comments in support of the recommendation. The Missouri Office of the Public Counsel and Environmental Defense Fund filed comments on July 29 and August 1, 2022, respectively, raising concerns about the Spire STL Pipeline transaction, the ACA process itself, and other matters. The MoPSC has not yet taken any further action in the docket.\nThe MoPSC has initiated their annual ACA dockets (GR-2022-0135 and GR-2022-0136) to audit gas commodity and transportation costs for the 2020-2021 heating season, which includes the impact of Winter Storm Uri on Spire Missouri's natural gas portfolio. The cases are expected to focus on the cost and amount of incremental natural gas purchases for the storm period, as well as the subscription and use of transportation and natural gas storage assets during the period.\nOn February 23, 2022, the MoPSC issued an order approving Spire Missouris request for $800.0 in new financing authority over three years, subject to certain customary conditions.\nSpire Alabama\nIn October 2018, the APSC approved the renewal of its Rate Stabilization and Equalization (RSE) rate-setting process for Spire Alabama through September 30, 2022, limiting equity as a percent of total capitalization to a range of 56.5% to 55.5%. Under RSE, the APSC conducts quarterly reviews to determine whether Spire Alabamas return on average common equity (ROE) at the end of the rate year will be within the allowed range of return. Reductions in rates can be made quarterly to bring the projected ROE within the allowed range; increases, however, are allowed only once each rate year, effective December 1, and cannot exceed 4% of prior-year revenues. Spire Alabamas allowed range of ROE is 10.15% to 10.65% with an adjusting point of 10.4%. In September 2022, the APSC approved the renewal of RSE through September 30, 2025, with certain modifications to the current terms. Effective October 1, 2022, Spire Alabama's allowed range of return on average common equity is 9.50% to 9.90% with an adjusting point of 9.70%. Average Common Equity growth is limited to 6.00% each year. Spire Alabama retains the ability to receive a performance-based adjustment of +/- 10 basis points to the return on equity adjusting point, based upon the terms of the previously approved Accelerated Infrastructure Modernization (AIM) Program tariff. However, in September of 2022, Spire applied for and received approval to suspend the operation of the AIM performance-based adjustment for 2023. The quarterly reviews have been modified to occur only in March, June, and September. Spire Alabama retained the current equity limitation as a percent of total capitalization at 55.5% and adjustments to the Cost Control Measure (CCM) as noted below.\nThe inflation-based CCM established by the APSC, allows for annual changes in operation and maintenance (O&M) expense per customer relative to an index range. The CCM will be calculated based upon O&M expense per customer and the O&M base year will be Spire Alabamas actual 2018 O&M expense with an adjustment to that base in 2019 of 2/3 of the 2018 CCM differential (amount below the CCM range in 2018) and an adjustment in 2020 of 1/3 of the 2018 CCM differential, with no adjustment to the base in 2021 and 2022. Spire Alabamas 2018 actual rate year O&M expense will be inflation-adjusted using a new index range based on the June CPI-U each rate year plus or minus 1.50%. If rate year O&M expense falls within the index range, no adjustment is required. If rate year O&M expense exceeds the index range, three-quarters of the difference is returned to customers through future rate adjustments. To the extent rate year O&M is less than the index range, Spire Alabama benefits by one-half of the difference through future rate adjustments. Effective October 1, 2022, the Base Year O&M expense will be computed by averaging the actual O&M expenses for 2020, 2021, and 2022. The Base CPI-U will be computed by averaging the August CPI-U for 2020, 2021, 2022. The Index will be computed by measuring the change from the Base CPI-U to the August CPI-U of the preceding completed fiscal year, less a factor of 1.50%. The index range will be computed by adjusting the index plus or minus 1.50%. If rate year O&M expense falls within the index range, no adjustment is required. If rate year O&M expense exceeds the index range, three-quarters of the difference is returned to customers through future rate adjustments. To the extent rate year O&M is less than the index range, Spire Alabama benefits by one-half of the difference through future rate adjustments. If a benefit is achieved, the Base Year and the Base CPI-U for the following year will each be reset to an average of the three preceding completed years. If a benefit is not achieved, the Base Year and Base CPI-U will not be updated. Certain items that fluctuate based on situations demonstrated to be beyond Spire Alabamas control may be excluded from the CCM calculation.\nThe RSE reduction for September 30, 2021, following the year end point of test was $2.2 to bring the expected rate of return on average common equity to within the allowed rate of return. The CCM benefit for rate year 2021 was $8.8. To mitigate the impact on ratepayers, Spire Alabama requested and received approval from the APSC to recover the 2021 CCM benefit over five years (with recognition of revenue only up to 24 months in advance of recovery). As a part of the annual update for RSE, on December 29, 2021, Spire Alabama filed an increase for rate year 2022 of $5.3. The 2021 RSE reduction of $2.2, the five-year recovery of the 2021 CCM benefit of $8.8 and the annual RSE increase of $5.3 were all effective on January 1, 2022. There was no RSE reduction in 2022 for the January 31, April 30, July 31 or September 30 quarterly points of test. Spire Alabama recorded a CCM benefit for rate year 2022 of $17.2. Similar to the rate year 2021 CCM benefit, Spire has requested and received approval to recover the rate year 2022 CCM benefit over five years. On October 26, 2022, Spire Alabama made its annual RSE rate filing with the APSC, presenting the utilitys budget for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023, including net income and a calculation of allowed ROE.\nSpire Alabamas rate schedules for natural gas distribution charges contain a GSA rider which permits the pass-through to customers of changes in the cost of gas supply. Spire Alabamas tariff provides a temperature adjustment mechanism, also included in the GSA rider, which is designed to moderate the impact of departures from normal temperatures on Spire Alabamas earnings. The temperature adjustment applies primarily to residential, small commercial and small industrial customers. Other non-temperature weather-related conditions that may affect customer usage are not included in the temperature adjustment. There is also a mechanism under Spire Alabama's GSA rider allowing the utility to create value through off-system sales of excess natural gas supply and capacity and to retain 25% of the value created while giving 75% of the value to customers. As of April 2022, the first $1.6 of value from capacity release goes entirely to customers before Spire Alabama retains 25%. In the past year, Spire Alabama filed GSA rate increases effective December 1, 2021, April 1, 2022, August 1, 2022, and October 1, 2022, primarily attributable to higher natural gas prices.\nThe APSC approved an Enhanced Stability Reserve (ESR) in 1998, which was subsequently modified and expanded in 2010. As currently approved, the ESR provides deferred treatment and recovery for the following: (1) extraordinary O&M expenses related to environmental response costs; (2) extraordinary O&M expenses related to self-insurance costs that exceed $1.0 per occurrence; (3) extraordinary O&M expenses, other than environmental response costs and self-insurance costs, resulting from a single force majeure event or multiple force majeure events greater than $0.3 and $0.4, respectively, during a rate year; and (4) negative individual large commercial and industrial customer budget revenue variances that exceed $0.4 during a rate year. Charges to the ESR are subject to certain limitations which may disallow deferred treatment and which prescribe the timing of recovery. Subsequent to the nine-year period and subject to APSC authorization, Spire Alabama expects to be able to recover underfunded ESR balances over a five-year amortization period with an annual limitation of $0.7. Amounts in excess of this limitation are deferred for recovery in future years.\nOn July 12, 2022, the APSC approved Spire Alabamas application for an intercompany revolving credit agreement allowing Spire Alabama to borrow from Spire in a principal amount not to exceed $275.0 (up from the previously approved $200.0) at any time outstanding in combination with its bank line of credit, and to loan to Spire in a principal amount not to exceed $25.0 (unchanged) at any time outstanding. On September 13, 2022, the APSC approved an application for up to $175.0 of additional long-term debt financing for Spire Alabama (ultimately issued on October 13, 2022).\nSpire\nIn addition to those discussed above for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, Spire is affected by the following regulatory matters.\nSpire Gulf has similar rate regulation to Spire Alabama. Its RSE rate-setting mechanism was renewed in September 2021 for a four-year term through September 2025. The RSE allowed ROE range was 10.45% to 10.95% with an adjusting point of 10.70% in fiscal 2021, while the ROE range is 9.70% to 10.30% with an adjusting point of 9.95% for fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2025. On October 26, 2021, Spire Gulf made its annual RSE rate filing with the APSC based on its budget for fiscal 2022 and an allowed ROE of 9.95%. New rates designed to provide increased annual revenues of $1.0 became effective January 3, 2022. On October 26, 2022, Spire Gulf made its annual RSE filing for fiscal 2023 reflecting an increase to annual revenues of $3.5 that is pending review by the APSC. The CCM has similar evaluation and recovery provisions when expenses exceed or are under a band of +/- 1.50% around the CPI-U inflated O&M per customer expense level from the base year, excluding expenses for pensions and gas bad debt. The base year for the O&M index was 2017 for fiscal 2020 and 2021 and was 2021 for fiscal 2022. Since a CCM benefit was recorded in fiscal 2022, the base year O&M index for fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2025 will be the 2022 O&M level. Spire Gulf recorded a CCM benefit for rate year 2021 of $2.3 to revenues, resulting in a net income benefit of $1.6. A CCM benefit of $1.7 was recorded for fiscal 2022 to an economic development fund that can be used for economic development purposes subject to APSC approval. Spire Gulf has a Cast Iron Main Replacement Factor (CIF) that provides an enhanced return on the pro-rata costs associated with cast iron main replacement exceeding 10 miles per year based on a 75% weighting for the equity content. Capital expenditures recovered under the CIF have not increased since fiscal 2019 pursuant to applicable tariff provisions although the Company is continuing to recover costs of service associated with accumulated expenditures under the CIF. Spire Gulf also has an ESR for negative revenue variances over $0.1 or a force majeure event expense of $0.1 (or two events that exceed $0.15), a Self Insurance Reserve for general liability coverage, and an Environmental Cost Recovery Factor that recovers 90% of prudently incurred costs for compliance with environmental laws, rules and regulations. Spire Gulf has an APSC-approved intercompany revolving credit agreement with Spire to borrow in a principal amount not to exceed $75.0 and to loan up to $25.0. On September 13, 2022, the APSC approved the issuance of $30.0 of long-term debt (ultimately issued on October 13, 2022) to refinance outstanding short-term debt.\nSpire Mississippi utilizes a formula rate-making process under the Rate Stabilization Adjustment Rider (RSA). An allowed return on equity (currently 10.03%) is computed annually and compared to the actual return on equity based on a rate year ending June 30. If the actual equity return on an end of period rate base is beyond the allowed return on equity by 1.0%, then 75% of any shortfall is recovered through a rate increase and 50% of any excess results in a rate decrease. Updates may include known and measurable adjustments to historic costs from the 12 months ended June 30, submitted September 15 for an effective date of November 1, unless disputed by the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff (MPUS), with any disputes to be resolved by the Mississippi Public Service Commission (MSPSC) by January 15 of the following year. On January 12, 2021, the MSPSC approved an agreement between Spire Mississippi and the MPUS settling its RSA filing that was made on August 28, 2020, resulting in a $0.3 increase in annual revenue. New rates became effective January 13, 2021. On August 23, 2021, Spire Mississippi filed its RSA for the rate year ended June 30, 2021, which reflected an increase to annual revenue totaling $1.1. The MSPSC, by its order dated January 18, 2022, approved a stipulation agreement between the MPUS and Spire Mississippi that provided for increased annual revenues of $0.8 through rates that became effective on February 1, 2022. Spire Mississippis RSA filing made on September 14, 2022 reflected a rate increase of $1.3 and is pending review by the MPUS. A Supplemental Growth Rider provides recovery of certain system expansion projects to serve qualified economic development projects.\nIn August 2018, the FERC approved an order issuing a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the Spire STL Pipeline ( August 2018 Order). In November 2018, the FERC issued a Notice to Proceed, and in November 2019, Spire STL Pipeline received FERC authorization to place the pipeline into service. Also, in November 2019, the FERC issued an Order on Rehearing of the August 2018 Order dismissing or denying the outstanding requests for rehearing filed by several parties, dismissing the request for stay filed by one party, and noting the withdrawal of the request for rehearing by another party. In January 2020, two of the rehearing parties filed petitions for review of the FERCs orders with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (DC Circuit). On June 22, 2021, that court issued an order vacating the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity and remanding the matter back to the FERC for further action. On September 14, 2021, and December 3, 2021, the FERC issued temporary certificates to allow the pipeline to continue operating indefinitely while it considers approval of a new permanent certificate. Certain parties in the temporary certificate proceeding sought rehearing of the FERCs December 3, 2021 temporary certificate. The FERC denied rehearing by operation of law on February 3, 2022. On March 7, 2022, one group of the rehearing parties filed a petition for review of FERCs December 3, 2021 temporary certificate order in the DC Circuit limited to whether the temporary certificates carry eminent domain authority. On June 29, 2022, the DC Circuit issued an order holding the proceeding in abeyance pending the outcome of the FERC remand proceeding. Meanwhile on December 15, 2021, the FERC issued a notice of intent to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement (EIS) regarding the Spire STL Pipeline. On October 7, 2022, the FERC staff issued its final EIS, concluding that impacts from the continued operation of the Spire STL [Pipeline] would be less than significant, with the exception of climate change impacts resulting from GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions that are not characterized as significant or insignificant.\nSpire STL Pipeline will continue to pursue all legal and regulatory avenues to ensure access to reliable, affordable and safe delivery of energy for eastern Missouri. While there is no impairment at this time, if the pipeline is taken out of service, the Companys financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted by impairment of Spire STL Pipelines assets, currently carried at over $270, and other effects. If Spire Missouri is unable to obtain sufficient pipeline capacity to meet its customers annual and seasonal natural gas demands, Spire Missouris financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nOn October 9, 2020, Spire Storage West LLC (Spire Storage) filed with the FERC an Abbreviated Application for an Amendment of Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, Reaffirmation of Market-Based Rate Authority, and Related Authorizations pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act. The application requests authorization to expand capacity and increase pipeline connectivity at certain of Spire Storages natural gas storage facilities in Wyoming. On March 15, 2022, the FERC issued a final EIS for this project, concluding that construction and operation of the project would not result in significant environmental impacts and that project greenhouse gas emissions fall even below the FERCs presumptive significance threshold for climate change impacts. On May 19, 2022, the FERC approved an order issuing certificates and granting abandonment as requested in the application. On June 21, 2022, following the submittal of an implementation plan, the FERC staff issued its limited notice to proceed with the project.\n16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nCommitments\nThe Company and the Utilities have entered into contracts with various counterparties, expiring on dates through 2039, for the storage, transportation, and supply of natural gas. Minimum payments required under the contracts in place at September 30, 2022, are estimated at $2,107.1, $1,224.7 and $723.1 for the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively. Additional contracts are generally entered into prior to or during the heating season of November through April. The Utilities recover their costs from customers in accordance with their PGA clauses or GSA riders.\nA consolidated subsidiary is a limited partner in an unconsolidated partnership focusing on sustainability initiatives largely tied to the natural gas utility sector. Spire committed to contribute a total of $10.0 of capital to the partnership as and when requested by the general partner. As of September 30, 2022, Spire has contributed $1.9.\nContingencies\nThe Company and the Utilities account for contingencies, including environmental liabilities, in accordance with accounting standards under the loss contingency guidance of ASC Topic 450, Contingencies, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\nIn addition to matters noted below, the Company and the Utilities are involved in other litigation, claims, and investigations arising in the normal course of business. Management, after discussion with counsel, believes the final outcome will not have a material effect on the statements of income, balance sheets, and statements of cash flows of the Company, Spire Missouri, or Spire Alabama. However, there is uncertainty in the valuation of pending claims and prediction of litigation results.\nThe Company and the Utilities own and operate natural gas distribution, transmission, and storage facilities, the operations of which are subject to various environmental laws, regulations, and interpretations. While environmental issues resulting from such operations arise in the ordinary course of business, such issues have not materially affected the Companys or Utilities financial position and results of operations. As environmental laws, regulations, and their interpretations change, the Company or the Utilities may incur additional environmental liabilities that may result in additional costs, which may be material.\nIn the natural gas industry, many gas distribution companies have incurred environmental liabilities associated with sites they or their predecessor companies formerly owned or operated where manufactured gas operations took place. The Utilities each have former manufactured gas plant (MGP) operations in their respective service territories, some of which are discussed under the Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama headings below. To the extent costs are incurred associated with environmental remediation activities, the Utilities would request authority from their respective regulators to defer such costs (less any amounts received from insurance proceeds or as contributions from other potentially responsible parties (PRPs)) and collect them through future rates.\nTo date, costs incurred for all Spire MGP sites for investigation, remediation and monitoring have not been material. However, the amount of costs relative to future remedial actions at these and other sites is unknown and may be material. The actual future costs that Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama may incur could be materially higher or lower depending upon several factors, including whether remediation will be required, final selection and regulatory approval of any remedial actions, changing technologies and government regulations, the ultimate ability of other PRPs to pay, and any insurance recoveries.\nIn 2020, Spire retained an outside consultant to conduct probabilistic cost modeling of its former MGP sites in Missouri and Alabama. The purpose of this analysis was to develop an estimated range of probabilistic future liability for each of their MGP sites. That analysis, completed in March 2021, provided a range of demonstrated possible future expenditures to investigate, monitor and remediate the former MGP sites. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have recorded their best estimates of the probable expenditures that relate to these matters. The amount remains immaterial, and Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and the Company do not expect potential liabilities that may arise from remediating these sites to have a material impact on their future financial condition or results of operations.\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Missouri has identified three former MGP sites in the city of St. Louis, Missouri (the City) where costs have been incurred and claims have been asserted. Spire Missouri has enrolled two of the sites in the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MoDNR) Brownfields/Voluntary Cleanup Program (BVCP). The third site is the result of an assertion by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\nIn conjunction with redevelopment of the Carondelet Coke site, Spire Missouri and another former owner of the site entered into an agreement (the Remediation Agreement) with the City development agencies, the developer, and an environmental consultant that obligates one of the City agencies and the environmental consultant to remediate the site and obtain a No Further Action (NFA) letter from the MoDNR. The Remediation Agreement also provides for a release of Spire Missouri and the other former site owner from certain liabilities related to the past and current environmental condition of the site and requires the developer and the environmental consultant to maintain certain insurance coverage, including remediation cost containment, premises pollution liability, and professional liability. The operative provisions of the Remediation Agreement were triggered on December 20, 2010, on which date Spire Missouri and the other former site owner, as full consideration under the Remediation Agreement, paid a small percentage of the cost of remediation of the site. The property was divided into seven parcels, and MoDNR NFA letters have been received for six of the parcels. Remediation is ongoing on the last parcel.\nIn a letter dated June 29, 2011, the Attorney General for the State of Missouri informed Spire Missouri that the MoDNR had completed an investigation of the second site, Station A. The Attorney General requested that Spire Missouri participate in the follow up investigations of the site. In a letter dated January 10, 2012, Spire Missouri stated that it would participate in future environmental response activities at the site in conjunction with other PRPs. Accordingly, Spire Missouri entered into a cost sharing agreement for remedial investigation with other PRPs. MoDNR never approved the agreement, so no remedial investigation took place.\nAdditionally, in correspondence dated November 30, 2016, Region 7 of the EPA has asserted that Spire Missouri is liable under Section 107(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) for alleged coal gas waste contamination at a third site, Station B. Spire Missouri and the site owner notified the EPA that information and data provided by the EPA to date does not rise to the level of documenting a threat to the public health or environment. As such, in March 2017 Spire Missouri requested more information from the EPA. Spire Missouri never received a response from the EPA.\nSpire Missouri has notified its insurers that it seeks reimbursement for costs incurred in the past and future potential liabilities associated with these MGP sites. While some of the insurers have denied coverage and reserved their rights, Spire Missouri retains the right to seek potential reimbursements from them.\nOn March 10, 2015, Spire Missouri received a Section 104(e) information request under CERCLA from EPA Region 7 regarding the former Thompson Chemical/Superior Solvents site in the City. In turn, Spire Missouri issued a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the EPA on April 3, 2015, to identify the basis of the inquiry. The FOIA response from the EPA was received on July 15, 2015, and a response was provided to the EPA on August 15, 2015. Spire Missouri has received no further inquiry from the EPA regarding this matter.\nIn its western service area, Spire Missouri has six owned MGP sites enrolled in the BVCP, including Joplin MGP #1, St. Joseph MGP #1, Kansas City Coal Gas Station B, Kansas City Station A Railroad area, Kansas City Coal Gas Station A, and Independence MGP #2. Source removal has been conducted at all the owned sites since 2003 with the exception of Joplin. On September 15, 2016, a request was made with the MoDNR for a restrictive covenant use limitation with respect to Joplin. Remediation efforts at the six sites are at various stages of completion, ranging from groundwater monitoring and sampling following source removal activities to the aforementioned request for the Joplin site. As part of its participation in the BVCP, Spire Missouri communicates regularly with the MoDNR with respect to its remediation efforts and monitoring activities at these sites. On May 11, 2015, MoDNR approved the next phase of investigation at the Kansas City Station A Railroad area.\nSpire Alabama\nSpire Alabama is in the chain of title of nine former MGP sites, four of which it still owns, and five former manufactured gas distribution sites, one of which it still owns. All are located in the state of Alabama.\nIn 2011, a removal action was completed and a \"no further action\" letter was received at the Huntsville manufactured gas plant site pursuant to an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent among the EPA, Spire Alabama and the current site owner.\nIn 2012, Spire Alabama responded to an EPA Request for Information Pursuant to Section 104 of CERCLA relating to the 35th Avenue Superfund Site located in North Birmingham, Jefferson County, Alabama. Spire Alabama was identified as a PRP under CERCLA for the cleanup of the site or costs the EPA incurs in cleaning up the site. At this point, Spire Alabama has not been provided information that would allow it to determine the extent, if any, of its potential liability with respect to the 35th Avenue Superfund Site and vigorously denies its inclusion as a PRP.\nAssessments were performed by the EPA of the former MGP sites in Gadsden and Anniston, and NFA letters were received after each assessment.\nSpire\nIn addition to those discussed above for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, Spire is aware of the following contingent matters.\nSpire Marketing, along with many natural gas industry participants, faced the unprecedented effects of Winter Storm Uri in February 2021. Numerous natural gas producers and midstream operators were unable to deliver natural gas to market as they experienced wellhead freeze-offs, power outages and equipment failure due to the extreme weather. These events resulted in supply curtailments, and related notices of force majeure to excuse performance, from and to certain counterparties. Further, these events have made Spire Marketing subject to various commercial disputes (including regarding force majeure). As such, Spire Marketing has recorded an estimate of potential liabilities for damages based on communications with counterparties and the facts and circumstances surrounding each transaction. These estimates are adjusted as new facts emerge or settlement agreements are reached, and it is possible that final settlement amounts may materially differ from the current estimate.\n17. LEASES\nThe lease agreement covering the Companys primary office space in St. Louis extends through February 2035, with an option to renew for an additional five years. Spire Alabamas lease agreement for office space in Birmingham extends through January 2037, with an option to renew for two additional five-year terms. The lease agreement covering Spire Marketing and Spire Storage office space in Houston extends through December 2028, with options to terminate three years earlier or to renew for an additional five years. The renewal options in the St. Louis and Houston leases are reasonably certain to be exercised and are included in the lease term used to determine the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.

Instead, the lease payments for short-term leases are recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease payments are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. The Company elected, for all asset classes, not to separate nonlease components from lease components and instead to account for each separate lease component and the nonlease components associated with that lease component as a single lease component.\nThe discount rate used for all the leases is the applicable incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. For a subsidiary lessee, the rate applicable to the subsidiary is used unless the lease terms are influenced by parent credit. Item 9.
