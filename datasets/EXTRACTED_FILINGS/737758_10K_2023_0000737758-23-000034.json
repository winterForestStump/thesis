    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nIntroduction\nWe design, manufacture, market and sell professional turf maintenance equipment and services; turf irrigation systems; landscaping equipment and lighting products; snow and ice management products; agricultural irrigation (\"ag-irrigation\") systems; rental, specialty and underground construction equipment; and residential yard and snow thrower products. Our purpose is to help our customers enrich the beauty, productivity, and sustainability of the land. Our products are marketed and sold worldwide through a network of distributors, dealers, mass retailers, hardware retailers, equipment rental centers, and home centers, as well as online and direct to end-users under the primary trademarks of Toro\u00ae, Ditch Witch\u00ae, eXmark\u00ae, Spartan\u00ae, BOSS\u00ae, Ventrac\u00ae, American Augers\u00ae, Trencor\u00ae, Pope\u00ae, Subsite\u00ae, HammerHead\u00ae, Radius\u00ae, Perrot\u00ae, Hayter\u00ae, Unique Lighting Systems\u00ae, Irritrol\u00ae, and Lawn-Boy\u00ae, most of which are registered in the United States (\"U.S.\") and/or in the primary countries outside the U.S. where we market our products branded under such trademarks.\nWe focus on innovation and quality in our products, customer service, manufacturing, and marketing. We strive to provide innovative, well-built, and dependable products supported by an extensive service network. We commit to funding research, development, and engineering activities in order to improve and enhance existing products and develop new products. Through these efforts, we seek to be responsive to trends that may affect our target markets now and in the future. A significant portion of our net sales has historically been, and we expect will continue to be, attributable to new and enhanced products. We define new products as those introduced in the current and previous two fiscal years.\nWe have continued to complement our brands, enhance our product portfolios, and improve our technologies through innovation and strategic acquisitions over the more than 100 years we have been in business. We plan to continue to leverage a strategic and disciplined approach to pursue targeted acquisitions that add value to TTC by complementing our existing brands, enhancing our product portfolio, and/or improving our technologies.\nWe classify our operations into two reportable business segments: Professional and Residential. Our remaining activities are presented as \"Other\" due to their insignificance. These Other activities consist of earnings (loss) from a wholly-owned domestic distribution company, certain corporate activities, and the elimination of intersegment revenues and expenses. Net sales of our reportable segments and Other activities accounted for the following percentages of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2023: Professional, 80.7 percent; Residential, 18.8 percent; and Other, 0.5 percent.\nSustainability is integrated into our enterprise strategic priorities of accelerating profitable growth, driving productivity and operational excellence, and empowering our people. Our focus on alternative power, smart connected, and autonomous solutions, as well as our continued efforts to address environmental, social, and governance priorities, are embedded as part of our commitment to advancing our sustainability goals.\nBusiness Combination\nAcquisition of Intimidator Group\nOn January 13, 2022, during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we acquired the privately held Intimidator Group (\"Intimidator\").

We maintain sales offices in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, China, Italy, Poland, Germany, Spain, France and Belgium. New product development is pursued primarily in the U.S. with the intention of global distribution. Our net sales outside the U.S. were 20.8 percent, 19.5 percent, and 20.9 percent of total consolidated net sales for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. For additional financial information regarding our international operations and geographical areas, refer to Note 3, Segment Data, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business. For additional information regarding our foreign currency exchange rate risk exposure, refer to Part II, Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEngineering, Research and Innovation\nWe believe that our longstanding commitment to innovation and quality in our products has been a key driver of our market success. We are committed to the development of innovative new products and improvements in the quality and performance of existing products. When applicable, we also may pursue targeted and strategic acquisitions to acquire innovative technologies that we believe bolster our longstanding commitment to innovation in our products and complement and support the development of alternative power, smart-connected, and autonomous products within our Professional and Residential segments.\nEngineering and research activities are performed at our global test sites and facilities and our products are tested in conditions and locations similar to those in which they are intended to be used. We invest time up front with customers, using \"Voice of the Customer\" tools, to help us develop innovative products that are intended to meet or exceed customer expectations. We use Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (\"DFM/A\") tools to ensure early manufacturing involvement in new product designs intended to reduce production costs. DFM/A focuses on reducing the number of parts required to assemble new products, as well as designing products to move more efficiently through the manufacturing process. We strive to make improvements to our new product development system as part of our continuing focus on Lean methods to shorten development time and reduce costs, while also improving quality.\nManufacturing and Production\nOur manufacturing facilities are designed to provide efficient and flexible assembly-line manufacturing of our products. In addition to most final assembly, we have strategically identified specific core manufacturing competencies for vertical integration, such as injection molding, extrusion, welding, stamping, fabrication, laser cutting, painting, machining, and aluminum die casting, and have chosen outside vendors to provide other services, where applicable. We design component parts through collaboration with our vendors, contract with them for the development of tooling, and subsequently enter into agreements with such vendors to purchase component parts manufactured using the tooling. We also have agreements with third-party manufacturers to produce certain standalone end-products on our behalf. In addition, our vendors regularly test new technologies to be applied in the design and production of component parts. Our manufacturing operations include robotic and computer-automated equipment intended to speed production, reduce costs, and improve resource use and the quality, fit, and finish of our products. Our operations are also designed to be flexible enough to accommodate product design changes that are necessary to respond to market conditions and changing customer requirements.\nIn order to utilize our manufacturing facilities and technology more efficiently and effectively, we pursue continuous improvements in our manufacturing processes with the use of Lean methods that are intended to streamline work and eliminate waste. Additionally, we use computer-aided design and manufacturing systems to shorten the time between initial concept and final production. DFM/A principles are used throughout the product development process to optimize product quality and reduce cost. We spend considerable effort to reduce manufacturing costs through Lean methods and process improvement, product and platform design, application of advanced technologies, enhanced environmental management systems, safety improvements, and improved supply-chain management.\nOur Professional segment products and Residential segment lawn and garden products are generally manufactured throughout the year with peak production generally occurring ahead of the key selling seasons for certain of our businesses and product lines that are more subject to seasonality. However, our Residential segment snow thrower products are generally manufactured in the summer and fall months but may be extended into the winter months, depending upon weather conditions in key regions, the related demand for such products and certain impacts from global supply chain disruptions. Our production levels and\ninventory management goals are based on estimates of wholesale and retail demand for our products, taking into account production capacity; commodity, component part, and labor availability; timing of shipments; and field inventory levels. Our production system generally utilizes Kanban, supplier pull, and build-to-order methodologies in our manufacturing facilities, as appropriate, for the business units they support in order to better align the production of our products to meet customer demand. We believe this has resulted in improved service levels for our participating suppliers, distributors, dealers, and other channels. We may also periodically shut down production at our manufacturing facilities in order to allow for maintenance, rearrangement, capital equipment installation, seasonality, and as needed, to adjust for market demand, facility renovation projects, and other factors. Production shut downs of this nature are generally not materially disruptive to our business and are considered to be normal.\nCommodities, Components, Parts, and Accessories\nWe purchase commodities, components, parts, and accessories for use in our manufacturing process and end-products or to be sold as stand-alone end-products. Our primary cost exposures for such items used in our products are with steel, aluminum, petroleum and natural gas-based resins, linerboard, copper, lead, rubber, engines, transmissions, transaxles, hydraulics, electrification components, and others, all of which we purchase from several suppliers around the world. We generally purchase commodities, components, parts, and accessories based upon market prices that are established with suppliers as part of the purchase process and generally attempt to obtain firm pricing from most of our suppliers for volumes consistent with planned production and estimates of wholesale and retail demand for our products. However, most of the commodities, components, parts, and accessories used in our manufacturing process and end-products, or to be sold as stand-alone end-products, are exposed to commodity cost changes, including, for example, as a result of inflation, changing prices, foreign currency fluctuations, tariffs, duties, trade regulatory actions, industry actions, changes to international trade policies, agreements, and/or regulation and competitor activity, including antidumping and countervailing duties on certain products imported from foreign countries, including certain engines imported into the U.S. from China. For additional information regarding changing costs of commodities, refer to Part II, Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in the section entitled \"Commodity Cost Risk.\"\nMost of the commodities, components, parts, and accessories utilized in our products are generally commercially available from a number of sources. Although we regularly monitor the adequacy of the supply of our commodities, components, parts, and accessories, and the financial health of the companies in our supply chain, and use alternative suppliers when necessary and available, financial hardship, insufficient demand planning, and/or the inability of companies throughout our supply chain to deliver on supply commitments, requirements, and/or demands has caused disruptions in our ability to procure the commodities, components, and parts required to manufacture our products.\nService and Warranty\nOur products are warranted to provide assurance that the product will function as expected and to ensure customer confidence in design, workmanship, and overall quality. Standard warranty coverage is generally provided for specified periods of time and on select products' hours of usage, and generally covers parts and labor, and other expenses for non-maintenance repairs. We also sell separately priced extended warranty coverage on select products for a prescribed period after the original warranty period expires. Warranty coverage generally does not cover operator abuse or improper use. An authorized distributor or dealer must perform warranty work. Distributors and dealers submit claims for warranty reimbursement and are credited for the cost of repairs, labor, and other expenses as long as the repairs meet our prescribed standards. Service support outside of the warranty period is provided by authorized distributors and dealers at the customer's expense.\nProduct Safety and Liability\nWe have rigorous product safety standards and continually work to improve the safety and reliability of our products. We monitor for accidents and possible claims and establish liability estimates based on internal evaluations of the merits of individual claims. We purchase insurance coverage for catastrophic product liability claims for incidents that exceed our self-insured retention levels.\nPatents and Trademarks\nWe own patents, trademarks, and trade secrets related to our products in the U.S. and certain countries outside the U.S. in which we conduct business. We expect to apply for future patents and trademarks, as appropriate, in connection with the development of innovative new products, services, and enhancements. Although we believe that, in the aggregate, our patents are valuable, and patent protection is beneficial to our business and competitive positioning, our patent protection will not necessarily deter or prevent competitors from attempting to develop similar products. We are not materially dependent on any one or more of our patents; however, certain TTC trademarks that contribute to our identity and the recognition of our products and services, including but not limited to the Toro\u00ae name and logo, are an integral part of our business.\nWe review certain patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\") and foreign patent offices to help avoid potential liability with respect to others' patents. Additionally, we periodically review competitors' products to prevent possible infringement of our patents by others. We believe these activities help us minimize our risk of being a defendant in patent infringement litigation. From time to time, we are involved in patent litigation cases, including cases by or against competitors, where we are asserting or defending against claims of patent infringement.\nSimilarly, we periodically monitor various trademark registers and the market to prevent infringement of and damage to our trademarks by others. From time to time, we are involved in trademark oppositions where we are asserting our trademarks against third-parties who are attempting to establish rights in trademarks that are confusingly similar to ours. We believe these activities help minimize risk of harm to our trademarks and help maintain distinct products and services that we believe are well regarded in the marketplace. For a description of our material intellectual property legal proceedings, refer to the headings titled \"Litigation\" and \"Litigation Settlement\" within Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSeasonality\nAs a result of our global presence in key markets that are subject to seasonal weather patterns, some of our businesses are seasonal. Overall, our seasonal shipment volumes are generally a function of the key selling seasons of our channel partners based on their industry, geographic location, and the nature and intended purpose of our products in relation to the correlating season. Seasonal weather patterns can impact the timing of the key selling seasons of our channel partners, which may cause our quarterly financial results to differ between fiscal years as demand for our products and related shipment volumes can shift between quarters. Such shifts in the demand for our products and related shipment volumes may result in a negative or positive impact on our net sales and other operating results for a particular period.\nOur shipment volumes generally precede and overlap the key selling seasons of our channel partners in order to better allow our channel partners to align field inventory levels with the anticipated retail demand from end-customers. As a result, our shipment volumes have historically been the highest in our fiscal second quarter, and retail demand for our products is generally highest in our fiscal third quarter. Typically, our accounts receivable balances increase between January and April as a result of higher shipment volumes and extended payment terms made available to our customers. Accounts receivable balances typically decrease between May and December when payments are received. Our financing requirements are subject to variations due to seasonal changes in working capital levels, which typically increase in the first half of our fiscal year and decrease in the second half of our fiscal year. Seasonal cash requirements of our business are financed from a combination of cash flows from operations, cash on hand, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, as applicable.\nShipments of our Residential segment products tend to be more seasonal than our Professional segment products, with shipments of lawn and garden products occurring primarily between February and June, depending upon seasonal weather conditions and product demand. Shipments of snow thrower products occur primarily between July and January, depending upon pre-season demand, in-season snowfalls, and product availability. Opposite seasons in global markets in which we sell our Residential products somewhat moderate this seasonality of our Residential segment product sales.\nSeasonality of Professional segment product sales also exists but is slightly tempered because the selling season in the Southern U.S. and our markets in the Southern hemisphere generally continue for a longer portion of the year than in Northern regions of the world. Our BOSS and Ventrac brands offer a portfolio of counter-seasonal snow and ice management products in our Professional segment with our shipments of snow and ice management products occurring primarily between April and December, which can result in variability of shipment volumes depending upon pre-season demand, in-season snowfalls, and product availability. Additionally, our rental, specialty, and underground construction business is generally less seasonal than certain of our Professional segment businesses primarily due to the strong presence of certain of the underlying brands in the Southern U.S. markets and the inherent nature of the underground construction market being less impacted by seasonal factors.\nEffects of Weather\nFrom time to time, seasonal weather conditions in particular geographic regions or markets, specifically severe wet or dry conditions, as well as significant weather events such as fires, hurricanes, tornados, drought, rainfall, unseasonably warm winter months, or other weather events, including those exacerbated by global climate change, may adversely or positively affect sales, demand, and field inventory levels of some of our products. In addition, weather conditions in key regions can cause disruption in our seasonality trends and supply chain, which may impact our ability to procure the commodities, components, parts, and accessories needed to manufacture our products to meet the needs of our customers, and such disruptions may adversely or positively affect sales, demand, and field inventory levels of some of our products. For example, persistent hot and dry weather patterns or excessive snowfall across key regions may impact the rate at which inventory needs to be replenished either negatively or positively.\nCustomers, Distribution, and Marketing\nWe market and sell the majority of our products through more than 150 distributors worldwide, as well as a large number of equipment dealers, irrigation dealers and distributors, mass retailers, hardware retailers, equipment rental centers, and home centers, as well as online and direct to end-users in more than 125 countries. Our distribution networks are intended to assure quality of sales and market presence, as well as to provide effective after-purchase service and support. Overall, we believe that in the long-term we are not dependent on any single customer. While the loss of any substantial customer could have a material adverse short-term impact on our business, we believe that our diverse distribution channels and customer base should reduce the long-term impact of any such loss.\nProfessional segment products are sold to distributors and dealers primarily for resale to golf courses, sports fields, contractors, government customers, and homeowners who prefer professional solutions, and in some markets for resale to dealers. We sell some Professional segment products directly to government customers and municipalities and rental companies, as well as to end-users in certain markets. Select irrigation and lighting products are sold to professional irrigation and lighting distributors and dealers, and certain professional-grade retail irrigation products are sold to home centers. Products for the rental, specialty, and underground construction markets are sold to dealers and rental companies, as well as direct to end-users in certain markets. Landscape contractor turf products are also sold to dealers in certain regions of North America. Snow and ice management products are primarily sold to distributors and dealers for resale to contractors.\nResidential segment products, such as walk power mowers, zero-turn riding mowers, and snow throwers, are generally sold to home centers, mass retailers, dealers, and hardware retailers, as well as online and direct to end-users. In certain markets, these same products are sold to distributors for resale to hardware retailers and dealers. Home solutions products are primarily sold to home centers, mass retailers, and hardware retailers. Internationally, Residential segment products are sold to dealers and mass merchandisers in Australia, Canada, and select countries in Europe. In most other countries, Residential segment products are mainly sold to distributors for resale to dealers and mass retailers.\nWe operate one wholly-owned domestic distribution company. Our primary purpose in owning a domestic distributorship is to improve operations and test and deploy new strategies and business practices that could be replicated by our independent distributors, as well as facilitating ownership transfers.\nOur current marketing strategy is to maintain distinct brands and brand identification for Toro, Ditch Witch, eXmark, Spartan, BOSS, Ventrac, American Augers, Trencor, Pope, Subsite, HammerHead, Radius, Perrot, Hayter, Unique Lighting Systems, Irritrol, and Lawn-Boy products. Across our brands, we market our Professional and Residential segment products during the appropriate seasons through multiple channels, including digital and online media, radio, print, direct mail, email, television, and social media. Most of our advertising and marketing efforts emphasize our brands, products, features, and other valuable trademarks. Advertising is purchased by us, through our agency partners, as well as through cooperative programs with distributors, dealers, and retailers.\nCustomer Financing\nInventory Financing Arrangements\nWe are party to a joint venture with Huntington Distribution Finance, Inc. (\"HDF\"), a subsidiary of The Huntington National Bank, established as Red Iron Acceptance, LLC (\"Red Iron\"), the primary purpose of which is to provide inventory financing to certain distributors and dealers of certain of our products in the U.S. For further information on this joint venture, refer to Note 7, Investment in Joint Venture, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are party to inventory financing arrangements with Red Iron, Huntington Commercial Finance Canada, Inc. (\"HCFC\"), and other third-party financial institutions (collectively, the \"financial institutions\") which provide inventory financing to certain dealers and distributors of certain of our products in the U.S. and internationally. For further information on these inventory financing arrangements, refer to Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEnd-User Financing\nWe have agreements with third-party financing companies to provide financing options to end-customers throughout the world. The purpose of these agreements is to provide end-users of our products alternative financing options when purchasing our products.\nOpen Account Terms\nAdditionally, we continue to provide financing in the form of open account terms directly to home centers and mass retailers, general line irrigation dealers, certain domestic and international distributors and dealers, ag-irrigation dealers and distributors, government customers, and rental companies.\nOrder Backlog\nOur order backlog represents unfulfilled customer orders at a point in time. The dollar value of our order backlog is equal to the gross sales value that we expect to bill to the customer and is not reduced for expected variable consideration related to certain of our sales promotions and incentives programs. Order backlog is one of many indicators of business conditions within the markets and industries that we operate; however, our order backlog is considered more representative of business conditions than an indicator of our expectation of our future net sales because the dollar value of our order backlog is a gross amount that has not yet been reduced for the variable consideration associated with certain of our sales promotions and incentives programs and because backlog can fluctuate for a number of reasons, including the seasonality of our business, product mix, pricing actions, manufacturing and shipping schedules, cancellation and rescheduling of orders by our customers, and the timing of when orders are originally placed by customers and when we are able to fulfill such orders.\nCompetition\nOur global business operations result in us competing with many U.S. and non-U.S. companies across our various markets, industries, and product offerings. These competitors and the degree of competition vary widely by industry, product line, end market, geographic scope and/or geographic location, including some competitors that have substantially larger operations and financial resources than we do and some that have smaller operations offering various capabilities to customers. We also experience a certain level of competition among our own brands within certain industries and end markets. Because of the diversity of our product portfolios and markets, our businesses typically have a different set of competitors in each geographic area and end market in which they participate. Accordingly, estimating the number of competitors or precise market share is challenging; however, we believe that we are a principal competitor in most of our industries and markets.\nThe principal competitive factors in our markets are product innovation; quality and reliability; pricing and sales programs; product support and customer service; warranty; brand and reputation; channel relationships, shelf space, and product availability; and financing options. We believe we offer total solutions and full service packages with high quality products that have the latest technology and design innovations. In addition, by selling our products through a network of distributors, dealers, mass retailers, hardware retailers, and home centers, as well as online and direct to end-users, users are offered comprehensive service support during and after the warranty period. We believe that we have a competitive advantage because we manufacture a broad range of product lines, we are committed to product innovation and customer service, we have a strong history in, and focus on, the markets in which our businesses operate, and our distribution channels position us well to compete in various markets.\nOur Residential segment products generally face a higher volume of competition than our Professional segment products given the relatively low barriers to entry resulting in numerous other manufacturers selling products that compete directly with our products. Internationally, our Residential segment products face more competition than in the U.S. because many foreign competitors design, manufacture, market, and sell products in their respective countries. We experience this competition primarily in Europe. In addition, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar affect the price of our products in foreign markets, thereby impacting their competitiveness. We provide pricing support to foreign customers, invoice in local currency, and execute foreign currency derivative hedging instruments, as appropriate, to remain competitive in international markets.\nHuman Capital Resources and Management\nOur Purpose, Vision, Mission and Guiding Principles\nWe believe our commitment to our human capital resources is key to:\nOur Purpose: To help our customers enrich the beauty, productivity and sustainability of the land.\nOur Vision: To be the most trusted leader in solutions for the outdoor environment. Every day. Everywhere.\nOur Mission: To deliver superior innovation and to deliver superior customer care.\nAs part of our guiding principles, we believe our success is deeply rooted in caring relationships built on trust and integrity. We believe these relationships are the foundation of our market leadership in innovation and solutions that make outdoor environments beautiful, productive and sustainable. We are committed to fostering a meaningful and enriching culture and engaging employee experience. We believe bringing more diversity to our workforce and our commitment to employee wellness and environmental stewardship create a sense of community, allowing employees to take pride in their jobs and live the TTC values.\nOur employees are guided further by our global Code of Conduct, which provides a framework for our actions and is the foundation of our partnership with TTC stakeholders-customers, suppliers, shareholders, communities, employees and others. Our goal is to foster a culture of trust and respect for all stakeholders and create a productive, supportive and thriving work environment for all TTC employees.\nNumber of Employees\nDuring fiscal 2023, we employed an average of 10,982 employees. The total number of employees as of October 31, 2023 was 10,706.\nUnions and Collective Bargaining Agreements\nAs of October 31, 2023, approximately 12.4 percent of our employees were represented by a union under a collective bargaining agreement. Our collective bargaining agreements typically are for terms of three to five years, and from time to time, our collective bargaining agreements expire and come up for renegotiation. Our four collective bargaining agreements expire in October 2025, March 2026, June 2026, and October 2026. We consider our employee relations to be good and currently do not expect any significant difficulties in renewing these agreements. We have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages in the past three years.\nEmployee Safety\nThe safety of our employees is paramount to us. We provide mandatory safety trainings each month in our production facilities, which are designed to focus on empowering our employees with the knowledge and tools they need to make safe choices and to mitigate risks. Supervisors also complete safety management courses. In addition to traditional training, we use safety scorecards, standardized signage, and visual management throughout our facilities. Safety best practices are also regularly featured in our employee newsletters and town halls.\nEmployee Engagement\nWe provide all employees with the opportunity to share their opinions and feedback on our culture through an engagement survey. Results of the survey are measured and analyzed to enhance the employee experience, promote employee retention, drive change and leverage the overall success of our organization.\nTalent Development\nWe strive to equip our teams and talent to deliver on the company's commitments to excellence by providing all employees a wide range of professional development opportunities, both formal and informal, at all stages in their careers. Our formal career development offerings include apprenticeships, job training, mentoring and coaching, leadership development, tuition reimbursement, a diverse curriculum of learning programs, leadership development experiences, vocational training and external partnerships across the globe. One of our unique leadership development programs is our Leadership in Motion program, a learning experience for nominated current and future TTC leaders to enhance leadership skills and collaborate with TTC colleagues in a cross-functional setting. The global program expands employee networks, provides visibility within the company, and builds capabilities needed for TTCs future. In small groups, participants work on a challenge critical to the company, such as technological innovation, communications, diversifying the workforce and talent retention. Over three months, they learn as a team, use newly gained skills and ultimately present recommendations related to their challenge to our Enterprise Leadership Team. Insights, themes and recommendations from cohort teams have contributed to actions in many areas for the company.\nWe have transitioned many of our professional development opportunities to virtual delivery options and expanded our offerings for on-demand learning to ensure that robust learning opportunities were still available to our employees who were not required to be physically present at our facilities and sites to perform their job responsibilities. One such example of a virtual development program is our Engaging Effectively program, which we offer to leaders who are required to manage differently in a remote and hybrid environment, yet still engage and achieve high performance standards with their teams.\nHealth and Wellness\nThe health and wellness of our employees are critical to our success. We provide our employees with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, which include but are not limited to, 24/7 call-in service access to a licensed physician, on-site nurses at some of our manufacturing sites to monitor employee health, safety, and wellness on a daily basis, various mobile apps that provide physical and mental well-being support. Such programs are designed to support employees physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe recognize that our best performance comes when our teams are diverse, and accordingly, diversity, equity and inclusion (\"DEI\") is core to us. We believe diversity can take the form of visible and known aspects like race, gender, age, and tenure, to less visible or known aspects like country of origin, gender identity, spirituality and more.\nTo promote DEI in the workplace, our DEI committee is focused on its strategic pillars of nurturing an inclusive workspace, attracting and maintaining a diverse workforce, and impacting the communities and markets in which our employees live and work. Initiatives developed by our DEI committee include, but are not limited to, events to celebrate heritage and awareness months, a new grant program for advancing equitable communities and the inception of an employee resource group to support women in the workforce.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe conduct compensation market benchmarking on a regular basis to ensure our pay remains competitive to attract and retain superior talent. In addition to annual base salaries, our total rewards, which vary by country/region, can include annual incentive opportunities, stock-based compensation awards, a 401(k) plan with employee matching opportunities, discretionary profit-sharing contribution to employee retirement plan accounts, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, adoption and surrogacy assistance, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance and on-site services, such as health centers and fitness centers, among many others.\nGiving and Community Involvement\nAt the heart of TTC is our commitment to people, and we believe that a satisfying life comes from contributing to, and engaging with, the communities where we live and work. Community support is core to our culture and our efforts reflect a dedication to action and engagement that enriches the lives, communities, industries and land that we serve. Our community efforts center on four areas: Employees, Community, Industry and Land. Water. Thrive. Through employee volunteerism and donations, corporate giving, and in-kind product donations, we enhance and beautify outdoor spaces while also supporting the shared value of our partner communities and organization.\nOur employees around the world volunteer with local charitable and civic organizations to complete beautification, preservation, water conservation, community health, and housing and youth enrichment projects, including supporting the beautification and preservation of outdoor environments, water conservation, community health, housing and youth enrichment. To help our employees make a meaningful impact on organizations that are important to them and us, we provide eligible employees in the U.S. up to 20 hours paid time off to volunteer.\nAs part of our Land. Water. Thrive. effort, we provide immersion experiences for our employees to work with smallholder farmers in developing countries to improve land productivity and agricultural water practices while also strengthening our employees empathy and customer-focused approach to problem solving.\nHuman Rights Policy\nWe are committed to respecting human rights in all respects of our global operations under the Toro Company Human Rights Policy. We believe that we have a responsibility to ensure that human rights are understood and observed in every location in which we operate. We strive to foster safe, inclusive and respectful workplaces wherever we do business, including prohibiting all forms of child labor and forced labor including indentured labor, bonded labor, military labor, slave labor and any form of human trafficking. We expect our business partners to comply with local labor and employment laws wherever they operate. We encourage each other to seek guidance on our Code of Conduct or other issues without fear of retaliation of any kind. Employees may anonymously report concerns, misconduct or suspected violation of the Code through our confidential web based reporting tool or over the telephone through our Ethics helpline.\nAdditional Information\nAdditional information is included in our Fiscal 2022 Sustainability Report, which is available on our website under the \"Sustainability\" section of our website located at www.thetorocompany.com. Information contained or referenced on our website, including in our Sustainability Report, is not incorporated by reference and does not form a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEnvironmental Matters and Other Governmental Regulation\nOur business, operations, facilities, and products are subject to numerous international, federal, state, and other governmental laws, rules, and regulations relating to, among others, climate change; emissions to air, including Tier 4 or similar engine emission regulations; discharges to water; restrictions placed on water usage and water availability; product and associated packaging; use of certain chemicals; restricted substances, including \"conflict minerals\" disclosure rules; recycling and waste disposal; import and export compliance, including country of origin certification requirements; worker and product user health and safety; energy efficiency; product life-cycles; outdoor noise laws; and the generation, use, handling, labeling, collection, management, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, and other regulated materials. For example:\nThe U.S. EPA, the California Air Resources Board (\"CARB\"), and similar regulators in other U.S. states and international jurisdictions in which we sell our products have phased in, or are phasing in, emission regulations setting maximum emission standards for certain equipment. Specifically, these agencies from time to time adopt increasingly stringent engine emission regulations. Following the U.S. EPA implementation of Tier 4 emission requirements applicable to diesel engines several years ago, China, the European Union (\"EU\") and its member states, and the United Kingdom also have adopted similar regulations, and similar emission regulations are also being considered in other global markets, including Australia, in which we sell our products. CARB's two phase implementation of net-zero emissions requirements for small off-road engines, like those contained in many lawn and garden equipment, will begin for all products with model year 2024 and onward.\nThe SEC has proposed rules that would require registrants to include certain climate-related disclosures in their registration statements and periodic reports, including greenhouse gas emission data and climate-related financial statement metrics. The state of California has recently passed two bills that will require certain companies doing businesses in the state to disclose greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related financial risk information. The European Union Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive applies to both EU and non-EU in-scope entities and would require them to disclose various metrics relating to climate change, biodiversity, workforce, supply chain, and business ethics.\nThe U.S. federal government, several U.S. states, and certain international jurisdictions in which we sell our products, including the EU and each of its member states, have implemented one or more of the following: product life-cycle laws, rules, or regulations, which are intended to reduce waste and environmental and human health impact, and require manufacturers to label, collect, dispose, and recycle certain products, including some of our products, at the end of their useful life, including, but not limited to (i) the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment directive, which mandates the labeling, collection, and disposal of specified waste electrical and electronic equipment; (ii) the Restriction on the use of Hazardous Substances directive or similar substance level laws, rules, or regulations, which restrict the use of several specified hazardous materials in the manufacture of specific types of electrical and electronic equipment; (iii) the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals directive or similar substance level laws, rules, or regulations that require notification of use of certain chemicals, or ban or restrict the use of certain chemicals; (iv) the Battery Directive, which regulates the manufacture and disposal of batteries; (v) country of origin laws, rules, or regulations, which require certification of the geographic origin of our finished goods products and/or components used in our products through documentation and/or physical markings, as applicable; (vi) energy efficiency laws, rules, or regulations, which are intended to reduce the use and inefficiencies associated with energy and natural resource consumption and require specified efficiency ratings and capabilities for certain products; (vii) outdoor noise laws, which are intended to reduce noise emissions in the environment from outdoor equipment; (viii) conflict minerals laws, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules promulgated by the SEC, which require specific procedures for the determination and disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as \"conflict minerals,\" which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries; (ix) other product substance restriction laws, some of which require certain labeling of products, such as California Proposition 65; (x) electromagnetic compatibility laws and regulations, such as the EU Electromagnetic Compatibility directive, and similar laws and regulations in other markets; (xi) wireless product type approvals and licenses in global markets and the EU Radio Equipment Directive and similar laws and regulations related to wireless and radio usage; and (xii) supply chain transparency laws and regulations addressing modern slavery and human trafficking.\nOur products may be subject to various federal, state, and international laws, rules, and regulations that are designed to protect users, including rules and regulations of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.\nOur vehicle and trailered products may be subject to various federal, state and international laws, rules and regulations related to vehicle safety and compliance with road regulations and safety, including the U.S. National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.\nThe manufacture and assembly of products within our facilities must comply with environmental regulations addressing air emissions, wastewater discharge, storm water run-off, and hazardous waste disposal.\nCompliance with existing laws, rules, and regulations has not historically had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or global competitive position. With respect to acquired properties and businesses, we conduct due diligence regarding\npotential exposure to environmental liabilities and overall regulatory compliance but cannot be certain that we have identified or will identify all adverse environmental conditions or non-compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. We are also involved in the evaluation and environmental clean-up of a limited number of properties currently and previously owned. We do not expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nCorporate and Other Available Information\nThe Toro Company was incorporated in Minnesota in 1935 as a successor to a business founded in 1914 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1983. Our executive offices are located at 8111 Lyndale Avenue South, Bloomington, Minnesota, 55420-1196, and our telephone number is (952) 888-8801.\nWe are a U.S. public reporting company under the Exchange Act, and file reports, proxy statements, and other information with the SEC.

RISK FACTORS\nThe following are material risk factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, operating results, industry, financial position, or future financial or operational performance. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business, reputation, operating results, industry, financial position, or future financial or operational performance.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThis summary is not complete and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed risk factors set forth below.\nEconomic and Operational Risks\nOur net sales and earnings have been and will likely continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions and outlook in the locations in which we conduct business.\nIf we are unable to enhance existing products and develop and market new products, demand for our products may decrease adversely impacting our net sales and earnings.\nDisruption and/or shortages in commodities, components, parts, or accessories has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our business.\nWeather conditions, including conditions exacerbated by global climate change, present chronic and acute physical risks, and have previously impacted, and may continue to impact, demand for some of our products and/or cause disruptions in our operations.\nOur Professional segment net sales are dependent on several factors, including golf, infrastructure and construction activity.\nOur Residential segment net sales are dependent on several factors, including product placement, consumer confidence and spending levels and changing customer buying patterns.\nChanges in our product mix have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our operating results.\nWe face intense competition, which could harm our business and operating results.\nIncreases in the cost of commodities, components, parts, and accessories have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our profit margins.\nWe are dependent upon our facilities and those of our suppliers and other third parties.\nWe are dependent upon a strong, effective labor force.\nOur net sales and other operating results are dependent upon us and our channel customers maintaining appropriate inventory levels.\nWe are dependent upon our channel customers.\nWe are dependent upon the availability and terms of credit offered to our customers.\nWe are dependent upon effective information systems.\nOur international operations involve risk.\nWe experience disruptions to our operations from time to time as result of facility changes and renovations.\nStrategic Risks\nOur strategy to pursue acquisitions and alliances, strong customer relations, and new joint ventures, investments, and partnerships and our recent activities in this regard involve risk and may prove to be unsuccessful.\nIncreased scrutiny regarding our ESG practices could impact our reputation.\nFinancial Risks\nWe incur impairment, restructuring, and other charges from time to time which harm our operating results.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations may harm our operating results.\nWe are dependent upon the availability and cost of our credit arrangements and any downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our access to and increase the cost of such arrangements.\nChanges in accounting or tax standards and policies and/or assumptions underlying estimates could harm our results of operations.\nLegal, Regulatory, and Compliance Risks\nOur patents, trademarks, and contractual provisions may be insufficient to protect our proprietary rights or we may infringe the proprietary rights of others.\nOur business, which is subject to extensive regulation, involves legal and regulatory risks.\nWe are subject to product quality issues, product liability claims, and other litigation from time to time.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may not achieve our financial projections or other business and productivity initiatives, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key executive and other talent or successfully implement key employee transitions, we may be unable to meet strategic objectives and our business could suffer.\nEconomic and Operational Risks\nOur net sales and earnings have been and could continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions and outlook in the locations in which we conduct business.\nAdverse economic conditions and outlook in the U.S. and in other countries in which we conduct business have and could continue to impact our net sales and earnings. These adverse economic conditions include, but are not limited to, business closures, slowdowns, suspensions or delays of production and commercial activity; recessionary conditions; slow or negative economic growth rates; slowdowns or reductions in levels of interest in the game of golf or golf course activity, development, renovation, and improvement; golf course closures; reduced governmental or municipal spending; reduced levels of home ownership, construction, and sales; home foreclosures; negative consumer confidence; reduced consumer spending levels; increased or prolonged high unemployment rates; higher costs, longer lead times, and reduced availability of commodities, components, parts, and accessories, including as a result of transportation-related costs, inflation, changing prices, foreign currency fluctuations, tariffs, and/or duties; inflationary or deflationary pressures; reduced infrastructure spending; the impact of U.S. federal debt, state debt, and sovereign debt defaults and austerity measures by certain European countries; reduced credit availability or unfavorable credit terms for our distributors, dealers, and end-user customers; higher short-term, mortgage, and other interest rates; government shutdowns; and general economic and political conditions and expectations. In the past, some of these factors have caused and may continue to cause our distributors, dealers, and end-user customers to reduce spending and delay or forego purchases of our products, which has had an adverse effect on our net sales and earnings.\nIf we are unable to continue to enhance existing products and develop and market new products, demand for our products may decrease.\nOne of our strategies is to develop innovative, customer-valued and high-quality products to generate revenue and earnings growth. In the past, our sales from new products, which we define as those introduced in the current and previous two fiscal years, have represented a significant portion of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of our future net sales. We may not be able to compete as effectively and ultimately satisfy the needs and preferences of our customers, unless we can continue to enhance existing products and develop new and innovative products, including by incorporating new, emerging, and/or disruptive technologies that may become preferred by our customers. For example, we have the transition risk of developing and marketing electric and alternative fuel products to meet market demands for less greenhouse gas intensive products.\nProduct development, improvement, and introductions require significant financial and technological resources, talent, research, planning, design, development, engineering, and testing at the technological, product, and manufacturing process levels, and we may not be able to timely develop and introduce new products, technologies or product improvements. New and innovative competitive products may beat our products to market; be higher quality or more reliable; be more effective, have more\nfeatures, and/or be less expensive than our products; incorporate new, emerging, and/or disruptive technologies; obtain better market acceptance; or render our products obsolete. Any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on, among other things, investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising, sales incentive and promotion programs, and research and development.\nDisruption and/or shortages in the availability of commodities, components, parts, or accessories has, and could continue to, adversely affect our business.\nGlobal supply chain disruptions, natural disasters, antidumping and countervailing duty petitions regarding certain engines imported into the U.S. from China, and other tariffs have, to various and differing degrees, impacted the availability of commodities, components, parts, and accessories used in our products. In addition, while most of our commodities, components, parts, or accessories are generally commercially available from a number of sources, certain items are sourced from single suppliers, which has limited, and could continue to limit, the availability of commodities, components, parts, and accessories when such suppliers are unable to meet our production requirements and we are unable to source such items from an alternative supplier in a timely manner to meet our production needs. This occurred at times during the past couple of years. Any continued or new disruption or shortages in the availability of commodities, components, parts, or accessories, including as a result of labor staffing, workforce shortage, or other challenges that our suppliers may experience as a result of financial hardship, pandemics and/or epidemics, natural disasters, and adverse weather, the frequency and intensity of which may be exacerbated by climate change, or other events, our inability to timely or otherwise obtain substitutes for such items, or any deterioration in our relationships with, the financial viability or quality of, or the personnel relationships at, our suppliers, could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWeather conditions, including conditions exacerbated by global climate change, present chronic and acute physical risks, and have previously impacted, and may continue to impact, demand for some of our products and/or cause disruptions in our operations.\nWeather conditions in particular geographic regions have adversely impacted, and will likely in the future, adversely affect the sales, demand, and field inventory levels and seasonality trends of some of our products. Weather conditions also have disrupted our own manufacturing and distribution facilities and our supply chain, which has impacted our ability to manufacture product to fulfill customer demand, and such disruptions may occur in the future. For example, drought or unusually wet conditions have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on sales of certain Residential and Professional mowing equipment products. Unusually rainy weather or severe drought conditions that result in watering bans, or otherwise, have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on sales of our irrigation products, and lower snowfall accumulations in key markets have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on sales of our Residential snow thrower products and products of our Professional snow and ice management business. Similarly, adverse weather conditions in one season may negatively impact customer purchasing patterns and net sales for some of our products in another season. For example, lower snowfall accumulations may result in lower winter season revenues for landscape contractor professionals, causing such customers to forego or postpone spring purchases of our mowing equipment products.\nFurther, our facilities and other operations and those of our channel customers and suppliers have incurred losses and experienced disruptions as a result of certain weather conditions and such losses or disruption may continue due to additional natural disasters, inclement weather, and/or climate change-related events, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, typhoons, drought, fire, other extreme weather conditions, and other natural disasters and events that occur as a result of such events, such as water or other natural resource shortages, rising sea levels, power outages or shortages, or telecommunications failures. Our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters and other disruptions is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Such coverage may not be adequate, or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms. The occurrence of any such events could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nGlobal climate change may exacerbate the frequency and intensity of unfavorable weather conditions, such as fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, drought, water shortages, rainfall, unseasonably warm winter months, or other weather events, many of which have increased in severity in recent years, in geographic areas where our products are manufactured, distributed, sold, and used and where our supply chains are located, and our sales and operating results may be affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced. Such weather conditions could pose physical risks to our facilities and critical infrastructure in the U.S. and abroad, disrupt the operation of our supply chain and third-party vendors, and may impact our operational results. Additionally, increased frequency and intensity of weather events due to climate change could lead to lost sales as customers prioritize basic needs.\nOur Professional segment includes a variety of products that depend on certain and varied factors.\nOur Professional segment includes a variety of products that are sold by distributors or dealers, or directly to government customers, rental companies, construction companies, professional and other users, including homeowners, engaged in maintaining and creating properties and landscapes, such as golf courses, sports fields, residential and commercial properties and landscapes, and governmental and municipal properties. Any one or a combination of the following factors, among others, have in the past resulted and could in the future result in a decrease in spending and demand for our products, resulting in an adverse effect on our Professional segment net sales and earnings:\nreduced revenue for golf courses resulting from a reduction in the level of interest in the game of golf and/or a decrease in rounds played, memberships, and/or food and beverage sales, as applicable;\nreduced investment in golf course renovations and improvements;\nthe level of new golf course development and golf course closures;\nreduced consumer and business spending on property maintenance, such as lawn care and snow and ice removal activities;\nlow or reduced levels of infrastructure improvements and other construction activities;\ndecreased oil and gas construction activities;\na decline in acceptance of, and demand for, ag-irrigation solutions for agricultural production;\navailability of cash or credit on acceptable terms for our customers to finance new product purchases; and\ncustomer and/or government budgetary constraints resulting in reduced spending for grounds maintenance or construction equipment.\nOur Residential segment net sales depend on several factors, including product placement, consumer confidence and spending levels, changing buying patterns of customers, and the impact of significant sales or promotional events.\nThe elimination, reduction, or changes in the placement of shelf space assigned to our Residential segment products at mass retailers and home centers have in the past adversely affected and in the future could adversely affect our Residential segment net sales. Our Residential segment net sales also depend upon the buying patterns of consumers and changes to buying patterns could result in reduced sales. For example, after the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers have shifted more of their spending away from home related products, including our Residential segment products, and back to other areas, compared to the historic levels of home related spending we experienced during the heights of the pandemic, which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our Residential net sales. In addition, as consumers purchase products at home centers and mass retailers that typically offer broader and lower price points than dealers, demand for and sales of our Residential segment products purchased at mass retailers and home centers, as compared to dealers and hardware retailers, have increased, adversely affecting our margins. We believe that our diverse distribution channels and customer base should reduce the long-term impact on us if we were to lose any substantial customer, but the loss of any such customer, a significant reduction in sales to such customers, our inability to maintain adequate product placement at mass retailers and home centers or our inability to respond to future changes in buying patterns of consumers or new distribution channels could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results. Furthermore, our quarterly or annual results have in the past and could in the future be impacted as a result of the timing of significant sales or promotional events for our Residential products.\nChanges in product mix could adversely impact our financial performance, including profit margins and net earnings.\nOur Professional segment products generally have higher profit margins than our Residential segment products. Accordingly, our financial performance, including our profit margins and net earnings, have been and will continue to be impacted depending on the mix of products we sell during a given period. For example, if we experience lower sales of our Professional segment products that generally carry higher profit margins than our Residential segment products, our financial performance, including profit margins and net earnings, have been and could continue to be negatively impacted. Similarly, within each reportable segment, if we experience lower sales of products that generally carry higher profit margins, our financial performance, including profit margins and net earnings, have been and could continue to be negatively impacted.\nWe face intense competition, which could harm our business and operating results.\nOur products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world and as a result, we compete with many U.S. and non-U.S. companies across our various markets, industries, and product offerings. These competitors and the degree of competition vary widely by industry, product line, end market, geographic scope and/or geographic location. The principal competitive factors in our industries and markets include product innovation; quality and reliability; pricing and sales promotion and incentive programs; product support and customer service; warranty; brand awareness; reputation; distribution, shelf space, and product placement and availability; and financing options. Some of our competitors have substantially larger operations and greater financial resources than us, and some have smaller operations offering various and/or more specialized capabilities to customers, and they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer preferences, or devote greater or more specialized resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products or disruptive new products or technologies than we can. In addition, competition could increase if new companies enter the market, existing\ncompetitors combine or consolidate their operations or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines. Our current products, products and technologies under development, and our ability to develop new and improved products and technologies may be insufficient to enable us to compete effectively with our competitors.\nOur Residential segment products generally face a higher volume of competition than our Professional segment products given the low barriers to entry resulting in numerous other manufacturers selling products that compete directly with our products. Internationally, our Residential segment products typically face more competition than in the U.S. because many foreign competitors design, manufacture, market, and sell products in their respective countries. In addition, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar may affect the price of our products in foreign markets, thereby impacting their competitiveness. Competitors may move manufacturing operations to low cost countries for significant cost and price reductions, and we may not be able to compete, which could harm our business and operating results.\nIncreases in the cost of commodities, components, parts, and accessories or our other costs of doing business, have, and could continue to, adversely affect our profit margins and businesses.\nWe purchase commodities, components, parts, and accessories for use in our manufacturing process and end-products or to be sold as stand-alone end-products, such as steel, aluminum, petroleum and natural gas-based resins, linerboard, copper, lead, rubber, engines, transmissions, transaxles, hydraulics, electrification components, and other commodities, components, parts and accessories. Increased costs and/or inflation, increased tariff, duties, or other charges as a result of changes to U.S. or international trade policies or trade agreements, trade regulation and/or industry activity, or antidumping and countervailing duty petitions on certain products imported from foreign countries, including certain engines imported into the U.S. from China, or the inability of suppliers to continue operations or otherwise remain in business, have affected our profit margins, operating results and businesses and could continue to result in declines in our profit margins, operating results and businesses. Historically, we have mitigated commodity, component, parts, or accessories cost increases, in part, by increasing prices on some of our products and executing on our strategic productivity initiatives, which include, but are not limited to, collaborating with suppliers, reviewing alternative sourcing options, substituting materials, utilizing Lean methods, and engaging in internal cost reduction efforts, all as appropriate. However, during the past couple of years, we experienced higher material, freight and manufacturing costs, which adversely affected our margins, and we may not be able to fully offset increased commodity, component, parts, or accessories costs in the future. Further, if our price increases are not accepted by our customers and the market, our net sales, profit margins, earnings, and market share could be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent upon the efficient operation of our facilities and those of our suppliers, channel customers, mass retailers, and home centers where our products are sold.\nProduction downtime and/or the inability to produce products at our facilities and those of our suppliers or other disruptions have occurred and could continue to occur as a result of several factors, including supply chain challenges, labor shortages, natural disasters, inclement weather, man-made disasters or other external events, such as terrorist acts or acts of war, pandemics and/or epidemics, boycotts and sanctions, widespread criminal activities, or protests and/or social unrest, or other events, at or in proximity to any of our facilities or in our manufacturing or other operations, or those of our channel customers, mass retailers or home centers where our products are sold, or suppliers. A work slowdown, strike, or similar action could occur at any one of our facilities, or the facilities of our channel customers and suppliers, and such facilities could fail to renew or enter into new collective bargaining agreements or may have to enter into a new collective bargaining agreement at a facility not currently covered by an agreement. Furthermore, we shift production between our manufacturing facilities from time to time and open new manufacturing and/or distribution facilities to align production capacity with production goals. Such events and disruptions could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or to deliver products to our customers, produce or maintain sufficient inventory of our products, receive commodities, components, parts or accessories from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our business globally or in certain regions. Such events also may result in shortages of commodities, components, parts, or accessories; higher fuel, transportation, and commodity costs; and delays in shipments to our channel customers.\nAny failure by us, or our suppliers or channel partners, to hire and/or retain an adequate labor force could adversely affect our business, operating results, and reputation.\nOur labor needs, and those of our suppliers and channel partners, fluctuate throughout the year and by region. During periods of peak manufacturing activity it is often necessary to sharply increase the number of production staff by utilizing new hires and temporary labor. Production staff hired during such periods of peak manufacturing activity may not have the same level of training, competency, experience, or commitment as regular production employees. In addition, due to limited workforce populations in areas around the locations where we, or our suppliers and channel partners, manufacture products or conduct business, or other factors, we, or our suppliers and channel partners, may not have a sufficient pool of individuals with the right skills and experience available to fulfill labor requirements on a cost-effective basis or otherwise.\nFor example, our labor needs and those of our suppliers and channel partners were negatively impacted by COVID-19, which exacerbated the challenges in retaining and maintaining an adequate production staff. If we, or our suppliers and channel partners, are unable to hire, train, and/or retain a labor force to adequately staff manufacturing operations, perform service or warranty work, or other necessary activities, we could experience disruptions in our manufacturing and other processes, which have in the past adversely impacted, and could continue to adversely impact, our business, operating results, and reputation.\nOur net sales and/or working capital are negatively impacted when we underestimate or overestimate demand for our products or do not maintain appropriate inventory levels.\nOur ability to manage our inventory levels to meet our customers' demand for our products and fulfill existing and future sales order backlog is important for our business. Our production levels and inventory management goals for our products are based on estimates of demand for our products, taking into account production capacity, timing of shipments, existing sales order backlog, and field inventory levels. Managing inventory levels during an uncertain macroeconomic environment is particularly difficult as a result of demand volatility; changes to production operations, locations and schedule; and supply chain challenges limiting our ability to source an adequate supply of commodities, components, parts, and accessories to meet our production requirements. These factors have resulted in, and could continue to result in, manufacturing inefficiencies and related unfavorable manufacturing variances that have negatively impacted, and could continue to impact, our financial results. Our net sales, margins, net earnings, and/or working capital are negatively impacted when we underestimate or overestimate channel or retail demand for our products, we are not able to manufacture product to fulfill customer demand and existing and future sales order backlog, and/or we do not produce or maintain appropriate inventory levels. Furthermore, such impacts hinder our ability to meet customer demand, result in the loss of customers, and could cause us to incur charges associated with inventory valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventories.\nOur business and operating results are subject to the inventory management decisions of our channel customers.\nWe are subject to risks relating to the inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices of our distribution network. Our channel customers carry inventories of our products as part of their ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs, including anticipated end-customer demand. Such adjustments have impacted our inventory management and working capital goals as well as operating results, and such adjustments may impact us in the future.\nChanges in composition of, financial viability of, and the relationships with, our channel customers could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective network of channel partners, including distributors, dealers, mass retailers, and home centers, for our products, we may not have adequate market coverage for the optimal level of sales of our products. Additionally, our channel customers may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products as we would expect, and/or they may not be successful in marketing and ultimately selling our products. Any weak demand for, or quality issues with, our products may cause our channel customers to reduce or terminate their relationships with us or adversely affect our ability to engage new dealers and distributors or maintain or obtain shelf space at mass retailers and home centers. Changes in the ownership or control of our channel customers could also adversely affect our relationships with them. If we are not able to maintain effective distribution channels, if our channel customers are not successful in marketing and selling our products, or if we experience a significant reduction or cancellation or change in the size and timing of orders from our channel customers, our sales could decline and have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIn addition, if adverse economic conditions, business conditions or other events cause a decline in sales by our channel customers or weakens their financial condition, our net sales and earnings could be adversely affected. Such situation could adversely affect the ability of such customers to pay amounts owed, which could require us to repurchase financed product.\nWe are dependent upon the availability and terms of credit offered to our customers.\nWe are a party to various floor plan arrangements in order to provide reliable, competitive floor plan financing to certain of our distributors and dealers primarily in the U.S. and Canada to support their businesses and improve our working capital for our other strategic purposes. As a result, we depend on such arrangements for our inventory financing programs. The availability of financing from our floor plan arrangements is affected by many factors, including, among others, the overall credit markets, the credit worthiness of our dealers and distributors, and regulations that may affect such financing providers. Any material change in the availability or terms of credit offered to our customers by our floor plan financing providers, challenges or delays in transferring new distributors and dealers from any business we might acquire or otherwise to our available financing platforms, any termination or disruption of our floor plan arrangements, or any delay in securing replacement credit sources could adversely affect our sales and operating results.\nWe are dependent upon the effective operation of our information systems, software, or information security practices and those of our business partners or third-party service providers.\nWe have many information systems and other software that are critical to our business and certain of our products, some of which are managed by third parties. These information systems and software are used to record, process, summarize, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including, among other things, our accounting and financial functions; our manufacturing and supply chain processes; managing personal data or other data relating to our customers, suppliers, and employees; and the data related to our research and development efforts. We may be unable to enhance our existing information systems and software or implement new information systems or software when necessary; may experience unanticipated delays, complications, or expenses in implementing, integrating, and operating our systems; and/or require substantial expenditures or interruptions in operations in connection with any system changes we might pursue, including as may be necessary during the integration of acquisitions. The failure of our information systems or software or those of our business partners or third-party service providers to perform properly, or difficulties encountered in the development of or transfer over to new systems or the modification or upgrade of existing systems, could disrupt our business and harm our reputation, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results to suffer. As we continue to develop internet-connected products and other new, emerging, and/or disruptive technologies, similar risks may also be present in the systems, technology, and software installed within such products.\nAdditionally, we take steps to secure our information systems and software and any access provided by our business partners or third-party service providers, including our computer systems, intranet and internet sites, email and other telecommunications and data networks. However, the security measures we have implemented may not be effective and our systems may be vulnerable to theft, loss, damage, and interruption from a number of potential sources and events, including unauthorized access or security breaches, data privacy breaches, natural or man-made disasters, cyber attacks, computer viruses, malware, phishing, denial of service attacks, power loss, or other disruptive events. Information technology security threats have been increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cyber attacks may be random, coordinated, or targeted, including sophisticated computer crime threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks including those that may be used by our products, and those of our business partners and third-party service providers, and to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data or data of our customers, suppliers or employees. Our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected if a significant cyber event or other event, disrupts or shuts down our operations; our confidential, proprietary information or data of our customers, suppliers, or employees is stolen or disclosed; our intranet and internet sites are compromised; data is manipulated or destroyed; we incur costs, are required to pay fines or face other regulatory enforcement actions, or our customers lose confidence in our ability to adequately protect their information in connection with stolen or disclosed customer, employee, or other confidential or sensitive information; we must dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection; or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs. As a result of a new SEC rule on cybersecurity disclosure, we are required to disclose, on a current basis pursuant to new Item 1.05 of SEC Form 8-K, any cybersecurity incident that we determine to be material and describe the material aspects of the nature, scope, and timing of the incident, as well as the material impact or reasonably likely material impact of the incident on us, including our financial condition and results of operations. We will also be required to describe, on a periodic basis, our processes, if any, for the assessment, identification, and management of material risks from cybersecurity threats, and describe whether any risks from cybersecurity threats have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, our boards oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats and managements role in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. We have incurred significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security breaches and incidents, and we may face increased costs and requirements to expend substantial resources in the event of an actual or perceived security breach or incident and to comply with this new SEC cybersecurity rule.\nOur insurance policies may not be adequate to compensate us for the potential losses arising from any such disruption, failure or security breach or incident. In addition, such insurance may not be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims made against us and could have high deductibles in any event, and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management attention.\nWe may incorporate traditional and generative artificial intelligence (AI) solutions into our information systems, products, offerings, services and features, and these solutions may become important in our operations over time. The ever-increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing and AI, creates opportunities for the potential loss or misuse of personal data that forms part of any data set and was collected, used, stored, or transferred to run our business, and unintentional dissemination or intentional destruction of confidential information stored in our or our third party providers' systems, portable media or storage devices, which may result in significantly increased business and security costs, a damaged reputation, administrative penalties, or costs related to defending legal claims. If the content, analyses, or recommendations that AI programs assist in producing are or are alleged to be deficient, inaccurate, or biased, our business, financial condition, and results of operations and our reputation may be adversely affected. AI programs may be costly and require significant expertise\nto develop, may be difficult to set up and manage, and require periodic upgrades. There is also a risk that we may not have access to the technology and qualified AI personnel resources to adequately incorporate ongoing advancements into our AI initiatives, including access to the licensing of key intellectual property from third parties. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their products more quickly or more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations. Our competition may have access to greater financial and technological resources, giving them a competitive advantage in recruiting, motivating, and retaining sought-after AI professionals. AI also presents emerging ethical issues and if our use of AI becomes controversial, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, or legal liability. The rapid evolution of AI, including potential government regulation of AI, will require significant resources to develop, test and maintain our platform, offerings, services, and features to help us implement AI ethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact.\nIn addition, our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems. This enables us to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving legal and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect employee and customer information, changes in the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems, and the information technology needs associated with our evolving products. There can be no assurance that our efforts (including, but not limited to, consolidating, protecting, upgrading, and expanding our systems and capabilities, continuing to build security into the design of our products, and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, including, but not limited to, generative AI platforms) will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future.\nOur international operations require significant management attention and financial resources, expose us to difficulties presented by international economic, political, legal, regulatory, accounting, and business factors, and may not be successful or produce desired levels of net sales and earnings.\nInternational markets have been, and will continue to be, a strategic focus area for revenue growth, both organically and through acquisitions. We currently manufacture our products and maintain sales offices in the U.S. and other countries for sale throughout the world. Our net sales outside the U.S. were 20.8 percent, 19.5 percent, and 20.9 percent of our total consolidated net sales for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. We believe many opportunities exist in the international markets, and over time, we intend for international net sales to comprise a larger percentage of our total consolidated net sales; however, expanding our existing international operations and entering into additional international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources. Several factors, including the implications of withdrawal by the U.S. from, or revisions to, international trade agreements, foreign trade or other policy changes between the U.S. and other countries, weakened international economic conditions, the impact of sovereign debt defaults by certain European countries, and current wars and related sanctions and other geopolitical tensions could adversely affect our international net sales.\nMany of the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products, or in which we otherwise have a presence are, to some degree, subject to political, economic, and/or social instability. As a result, our international operations expose us and our representatives, agents, and channel customers to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include:\nweakened economic conditions;\npandemics and/or epidemics;\nincreased costs of customizing products for foreign countries;\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international operations and increases in infrastructure costs including legal, tax, accounting, and information technology;\nthe imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations;\nnew or enhanced trade restrictions and restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives, and channel customers;\nwithdrawal from or revisions to international trade policies or agreements and the imposition or increases in import and export licensing and other compliance requirements, customs duties and tariffs, import and export quotas and other trade restrictions, license obligations, other non-tariff barriers to trade;\nthe imposition of U.S. and/or international sanctions against a country, company, person, or entity with whom we do business that would restrict or prohibit our business with the sanctioned country, company, person, or entity;\ninternational pricing pressures;\nforeign trade or other policy changes between the U.S. and other countries, trade regulation, and/or industry activity that favors domestic companies, including antidumping and countervailing duty petitions on certain products imported from foreign countries, including certain engines imported into the U.S. from China;\nadverse currency exchange rate fluctuations;\nlonger payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\npotentially higher tax rates and adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating cash and/or earnings to the U.S.;\nfluctuations in our operating performance based on our geographic mix of sales;\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\nnational and international conflicts, including the war between Ukraine and Russia, the war between Israel and Hamas, geopolitical tensions and foreign policy changes, acts of war or terrorist acts;\ndifficulties in protecting, enforcing or defending intellectual property rights; and\nmultiple, changing, and often inconsistent enforcement of laws, rules, regulations and standards, including rules relating to taxes, environmental, health and safety matters.\nOur international operations may not produce desired levels of net sales or, among other things, the factors listed above may harm our business and operating results. Any material decrease in our international sales or profitability could also adversely impact our operating results.\nWe are renovating and expanding certain office, manufacturing, and other facilities and could experience disruptions to our operations in connection with such efforts.\nWe are continually renovating and, where appropriate or necessary, expanding our facilities, primarily driven by the growth of our business and the need to expand our manufacturing capacity. We have historically financed, and expect to continue to finance, such efforts with cash on hand and cash from operating activities. Expanding and renovating our facilities could disrupt our business operations, and such effects could include but are not limited to potential interruption in manufacturing processes, delivery of raw materials, shipping finished goods, and data flow; unforeseen construction, scheduling, engineering, environmental, or geological problems; and unanticipated cost increases.\nStrategic Risks\nOur strategy to pursue acquisitions and alliances, strong customer relations, and new joint ventures, investments, and partnerships and our recent activities in this regard involve risk and may not prove to be successful.\nOne of our strategies is to drive growth in our businesses and expand our global presence through targeted acquisitions and alliances, strong customer relations, and new joint ventures, investments, and partnerships that add value and complement our existing brands and product portfolio. For example, in January 2022, we acquired the Intimidator Group, and in September 2023, we announced a strategic partnership with Lowe's.\nOur continued ability to grow through acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable target candidates at acceptable prices, terms, and conditions; our ability to compete effectively for acquisition candidates; and the availability of capital and personnel resources to complete such acquisitions and operate and integrate the acquired business effectively. Any acquisition, alliance, joint venture, investment, or partnership could impair our business, financial condition, reputation, and operating results. For instance, the benefits of an acquisition, or new alliance, joint venture, investment, or partnership may take more time than expected to achieve, or may not develop at all. Acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, investments, and partnerships may involve a number of risks, the occurrence of which could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, including:\ndiversion of management's attention to manage and integrate the acquired business;\ndisruption to our existing operations and plans;\ninability to effectively manage our expanded operations;\ndifficulties, delays, or unanticipated costs in integrating and assimilating information and financial systems, internal controls, operations, manufacturing processes and products or in realizing projected efficiencies, growth prospects, cost savings, and other synergies;\ninability to successfully integrate or develop a distribution channel for acquired product lines;\nloss of key employees, customers, distributors, or dealers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers, customers, distributors, and dealers;\nwrite-off of significant amounts of goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets, and/or long-lived assets because of deterioration in the performance of an acquired business or product line, adverse market conditions, changes in the competitive landscape, changes in laws or regulations that restrict activities of an acquired business or product line, or other circumstances;\ndelays or challenges in transitioning distributors and dealers of acquired businesses to available floor plan financing arrangements;\nviolation of confidentiality, intellectual property, and non-compete obligations or agreements by employees of an acquired business or lack of or inadequate formal intellectual property protection mechanisms in place at an acquired business;\nadverse impact on overall profitability if our expanded operations do not achieve, or are delayed in achieving, the growth prospects, net sales, net earnings, cost and/or revenue synergies, or other financial results projected in our valuation models;\nreallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in our leverage and debt service requirements to pay acquisition purchase prices or other business venture investment costs, which could restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed, result in a decrease in our credit rating, or limit our ability to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;\nfailure by acquired businesses or other business ventures to comply with applicable international, federal, and state product safety or other regulatory standards;\ninfringement by acquired businesses or other business ventures of valid intellectual property rights of others;\ninaccurate assessment of additional post-acquisition or business venture investments, undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition or other business venture, and despite the existence of representations, warranties and indemnities in any definitive agreement and/or a representation and warranty insurance policy, if applicable, an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs; and\nimpacts as a result of purchase accounting adjustments, incorrect estimates made in the accounting for acquisitions, occurrence of non-recurring charges, or other potential financial accounting or reporting impacts.\nFor example, at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $18.0 million related to the indefinite-lived Spartan\u00ae trade name intangible asset and $133.3 million related to the goodwill of the Intimidator reporting unit. These impairment charges resulted in a $36.7 million income tax benefit (deferred tax asset) associated with the remaining tax deductible basis in goodwill and other intangible assets.\nIn addition, we need effective internal controls to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. Integrating acquired businesses may make our systems and controls more complex and difficult to manage. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement, and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future, particularly in the context of acquisitions of other businesses, regardless of whether such acquired business was previously privately or publicly held. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our internal control framework could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nAlso, some acquisitions may require the consent of the lenders under our credit agreements. We cannot predict whether such approvals would be forthcoming or the terms on which the lenders would approve such acquisitions. These risks, among others, could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or other business venture or multiple transactions within a relatively short period of time.\nFailure to successfully complete divestitures or other restructuring activities could negatively affect our operations.\nFrom time to time, we may divest of all or a portion of certain businesses and/or facilities, joint venture or minority equity investment interests, subsidiaries, distributorships, or product categories. Divestitures involve risk, including, potential increased expense associated with the divestitures, and potential issues with the acquirers, customers or suppliers of the divested business, or products. Occasionally, we may wind down certain business activities and/or facilities, product lines, and/or perform other organizational restructuring projects in an effort to reduce costs and streamline operations. Such activities involve risks as they may divert management's attention from our core businesses, increase expenses on a short-term basis and lead to potential issues with employees, customers, or suppliers. If we do not complete these activities in a timely manner, or do not realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and efficiencies, business disruption occurs during or following such activities, or we incur unanticipated charges, this may negatively impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nIncreased scrutiny regarding our ESG practices could impact our reputation.\nIncreasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, and disclosure topics such as climate change, sustainability, natural resources, waste reduction, energy, human capital, and risk oversight could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report. We strive to deliver shared value through our business and our diverse stakeholders expect us to make progress in certain ESG priority issue areas. To address this growing set of matters, we have taken several actions, including hiring a new executive officer with responsibility for sustainability in July 2023, devoting additional dedicated employee resources, and creating a cross-functional/business sustainability leadership team to further develop and implement an enterprise-wide sustainability strategy. In June 2023, we released our sustainability report for fiscal 2022, which highlights certain aspirations and goals related to ESG matters, such as goals to increase battery and hybrid product sales, plans to reduce certain GHG emissions over time, and goals to increase the number of women and racial and ethnic minorities in leadership positions. No assurance can be provided that we will achieve our new sustainability goals. It is possible that we may be unsuccessful in the achievement of our ESG goals, on a timely basis or at all, or that the costs to achieve those goals become prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, our stakeholders may not be satisfied with our initiatives or efforts or the speed at which we are progressing towards any such\naspirations and goals. Additionally, organizations that inform investors on ESG matters have developed rating systems for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG. Unfavorable ratings may lead to negative investor sentiment, which could negatively impact our stock price. Any failure, or perceived failure, to respond to ESG concerns could harm our business and reputation. Certain challenges we face in the achievement of our ESG objectives are also captured within our ESG reporting in our sustainability report for fiscal 2022, which is not incorporated by reference into and does not form any part of this report.\nFinancial Risks\nWe incurred non-cash impairment charges during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 which adversely affected our third quarter and full year fiscal 2023 operating results and we may be required to incur additional future impairment and other charges, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn connection with our acquisitions and other business combinations, including our January 2022 acquisition of Intimidator, applicable accounting standards require the net tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business to be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at their fair values as of the date of acquisition and any excess in the purchase price paid by us over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets of any acquired business to be recorded as goodwill. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are tested at least annually for impairment or more frequently as events and circumstances dictate. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally an operating segment or underlying business component. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at the individual indefinite-lived intangible asset or asset group level, as appropriate. Finite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill considered long-lived assets for impairment testing purposes, are tested for impairment as events and circumstances dictate, and are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and this amortization expense may be significant to our ongoing financial results.\nIf we determine that the anticipated future cash flows from our reporting units, indefinite-lived intangible assets or asset groups, or long-lived asset groups may be less than their respective carrying values, our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and/or long-lived assets may be deemed to be impaired. If this occurs, applicable accounting rules may require us to write down the value of the goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and/or long-lived assets on our balance sheet to reflect the extent of any such impairment. Any such write-down of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and/or long-lived assets would generally be recognized as a non-cash expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the accounting period during which any such write down occurs.\nFor example, at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $18.0 million related to the indefinite-lived Spartan trade name intangible asset and $133.3 million related to the goodwill of the Intimidator reporting unit. These impairment charges resulted in a $36.7 million income tax benefit (deferred tax asset) associated with the remaining tax deductible basis in goodwill and other intangible assets. As of October 31, 2023, we had goodwill of $450.8 million, which is maintained in various reporting units, and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $271.5 million, which together comprise 19.8 percent of our total assets as of October 31, 2023. Any future impairment charges could be significant and could adversely affect our future consolidated operating results and financial condition.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our operating results.\nBecause the functional currency of most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency, but our financial reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, we are required to translate the assets, liabilities, expenses, and revenues of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, we face foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries, sales to third-party customers, purchases from suppliers, and bank lines of credit with creditors denominated in foreign currencies.\nForeign currency exchange rates have affected our net sales, net earnings, and operating results in the past and could affect them in the future, in some cases materially. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may also affect the comparative prices between products we sell and products our foreign competitors sell in the same market, which may decrease demand for our products. Substantial exchange rate fluctuations as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar or otherwise, may have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows, as well as the comparability of our Consolidated Financial Statements between reporting periods. While we actively manage our foreign currency market risk in the normal course of business by entering into various derivative instruments to hedge against such risk, these derivative instruments involve risks and may not effectively limit our underlying exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations or minimize our net earnings and cash volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes. Further, the failure of one or more counterparties to our foreign currency exchange rate contracts to fulfill their obligations to us could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are subject to financial and operating restrictions and counterparty risk as a result of our credit arrangements.\nOur credit arrangements, including our revolving credit facility, term loan and senior notes, and the indentures governing our senior notes and debentures, include a number of financial and operating restrictions. For example, our credit arrangements contain financial covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio. Our credit arrangements and/or indentures also contain provisions that restrict our ability, subject to specified exceptions, to, among other things, create liens or other encumbrances on our assets; dispose of assets; engage in mergers or consolidations; and pay dividends that are significantly higher than those currently being paid, make other distributions to our shareholders, or redeem shares of our common stock. These provisions may limit our ability to conduct our business, take advantage of business opportunities, and respond to changing business, market, and economic conditions. They may also competitively disadvantage us relative to other companies that may be subject to fewer, if any, restrictions or may otherwise adversely affect our business.\nPotential important opportunities or transactions, such as significant acquisitions, may require the consent of our lenders, which consent may be withheld or granted subject to conditions that may affect the attractiveness or viability of the transaction. Additionally, market deterioration or other factors could jeopardize the counterparty obligations of one or more of the banks participating in our revolving credit facility, which could have an adverse effect on our business if we are not able to replace such revolving credit facility or find other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms.\nIf we do not comply with the terms of our credit arrangements and indentures, they could be terminated and amounts thereunder could become due and payable.\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to comply with all of the terms of our credit arrangements and indentures, particularly the financial covenants. Our ability to comply with such terms depends on the success of our business and our operating results, as well as various risks, uncertainties, and events beyond our control. If we fail to comply with any covenant required by our credit arrangements following any applicable cure periods, the banks could terminate their commitments unless we could negotiate a covenant waiver. The banks could condition such waiver on terms that may be unfavorable to us. In addition, any amounts outstanding pursuant to our credit arrangements and indentures could become due and payable if we were unable to obtain a covenant waiver or refinance our debt under such arrangements.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our cost of funding and/or adversely affect our access to funding.\nOur credit ratings are important to our cost and availability of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate our credit profile and assign credit ratings to us. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, transparency with rating agencies, and timeliness of financial reporting. Further leveraging our capital structure could result in a downgrade to our credit ratings. For instance, if our credit rating falls below investment grade and/or our leverage ratio rises above 1.50, the interest rate we currently pay on outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility could increase. As such, failure to maintain investment grade credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funding and our liquidity by limiting the access to capital markets or the availability of funding from a variety of lenders.\nChanges in accounting or tax standards and policies and/or assumptions utilized in determining accounting or tax estimates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), we must make decisions that impact our results of operations and/or financial condition, including selecting the appropriate accounting and/or tax principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting and tax estimates. In reaching such decisions, we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances, historical experience, and actuarial and other independent external third-party specialist valuations, all as appropriate. As a result, actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared.\nIn addition, various authoritative accounting or regulatory entities, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and the SEC may amend, expand, and/or eliminate the financial accounting or reporting standards or tax positions that govern the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements or could reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various financial accounting and/or reporting standards or tax positions should be applied. We disclose the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet adopted within our annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. However, we do not provide an assessment of proposed accounting pronouncements, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and therefore, we cannot meaningfully assess their effects on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Future changes to accounting or tax standards could modify the accounting or tax policies and procedures that we currently use to prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements. Such changes may be difficult to predict and implement and could impact how we prepare and report our Consolidated Financial Statements, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFor additional information regarding our accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements, refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" in the section entitled \"Critical\nAccounting Policies and Estimates\" and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Related Data, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLegal, Regulatory, and Compliance Risks\nOur patents, trademarks, and contractual provisions may be insufficient to protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property from others who may sell similar products and our products may infringe the valid proprietary rights of others.\nWe hold patents and trademarks relating to various aspects of our products and business and believe that proprietary technical know-how is important to our business. The loss of such intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Proprietary rights relating to our products are protected from unauthorized use by third-parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are maintained in confidence as trade secrets. We cannot be certain that we will be issued any patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Without enforceable patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and know-how. We also cannot be certain that our products or technologies have not infringed or will not infringe the valid proprietary rights of others. Others may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents, allege that we infringe their patents, or use their resources to design comparable products that do not infringe our patents. Additionally, we may initiate proceedings to protect our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether initiated by us or others, may cause us to incur substantial costs and possible damages. If the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. We could also be forced to develop an alternative that could be costly and time-consuming, or acquire a license, which we might not be able to do on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nWe rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, suppliers, consultants, and others. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Even if these confidentiality agreements are not breached, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nWe are subject to extensive laws, rules, policies, and regulations, with which our compliance is costly and not guaranteed.\nWe are subject to numerous international, federal, state, municipal and other governmental laws, rules, policies, regulations, and orders (\"Laws\") relating to, among other things; climate change; emissions to air, including engine emission requirements; discharges to water; restrictions placed on water usage and water availability; product and associated packaging; use of certain chemicals; restricted substances, including \"conflict minerals\" disclosure rules; import and export compliance, including country of origin certification requirements; worker and product user health and safety; energy efficiency; product life-cycles; outdoor noise laws; the generation, use, handling, labeling, collection, management, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, and other regulated materials; and the registration of certain technologies with various government agencies throughout the world and operation of those technologies within the limits imposed by those agencies, including but not limited to radio frequency, broadband or other wireless technologies and technologies within the airspace of commercial airplanes, such as unmanned aerial systems. In addition, Laws may adversely affect our operating results, including, (i) to address health and safety requirements, (ii) taxation and tax policy changes, tax rate changes, new tax laws, or revised tax law interpretations or guidance, which individually or in combination may cause our effective tax rate to increase or result in tax charges, (iii) changes to, or adoption of new, healthcare laws or regulations, or (iv) changes to U.S. or international trade policies or agreements, or trade regulation and/or industry activity, including antidumping and countervailing duty petitions on certain products imported from foreign countries, including certain engines imported in the U.S. from China, that could result in additional tariffs, duties or other charges on commodities, components, parts or accessories that we import and/or use in our products.\nAlthough we believe that we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable Laws, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of adopted or future Laws on our company, business, properties, or products. Any of these Laws may cause us to incur significant expenses to achieve or maintain compliance, require us to modify our products, adversely affect the price of, or demand for, some of our products or manufacturing processes, and ultimately affect the way we conduct our operations. Failure to comply with any of these Laws could harm our reputation and/or lead to fines and other penalties, including restrictions on the importation of our products into, and the sale of our products in, one or more jurisdictions. In addition, our competitors may adopt strategies with respect to compliance with any such Laws that differ significantly from ours. This may change customer preferences and our markets in unanticipated ways which may adversely affect market demand for our products and our net sales and financial results. Other Laws impacting our supply chain, such as the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act, or data privacy requirements, such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and other emerging domestic and global data privacy and cybersecurity laws, may have similar consequences.\nClimate change legislation, regulations, accords, mitigation efforts, or other legislation may adversely impact our operations and could impact the competitive landscape within our markets and affect demand for our products.\nWe are currently subject to rules limiting exhaust and other emissions and other climate-related rules and regulations in certain jurisdictions where we operate. Concern over climate change has resulted in, and could continue to result in, new legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. An example of such legislation is California's AB 1346, which will require most new sales of small off-road engines, such as those installed in certain of our products, including leaf blowers and lawnmowers, sold in the state of California on or after January 1, 2024 to be zero-emission. We may become subject to additional legislation, regulations, or accords regarding climate change, and compliance with any new rules could be difficult and costly as a result of increased energy, environmental, and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with any such legislation, regulation, or accord or could otherwise decrease demand for our products.\nDue to uncertainty in the regulatory and legislative processes and the negotiation and adoption of international climate change accords, as well as the scope of such requirements and initiatives, we cannot currently determine the effect any such legislation, regulation, or accord may have on our products and operations. Additionally, inconsistency of regulations in the states and countries in which we operate may affect the costs of compliance with such requirements. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements, we may be subject to curtailment or reduced access to resources or experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations, which may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAdditionally, various other legislative proposals, if enacted, could put us in a competitively advantaged or disadvantaged position and affect customer demand for our products. For example, any fiscal-stimulus or other legislation that inordinately impacts the lawn and garden, outdoor power equipment, or irrigation industries generally by promoting the purchase of certain types of products that we sell, such as through customer rebate or other incentive programs, could impact us positively or negatively, depending on whether we manufacture products that meet the specified legislative criteria, including in areas such as fuel efficiency, alternative energy or water usage. Such legislation may also cause customers to perceive our product offerings to be more or less attractive than our competitors' product offerings. We cannot currently predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, the specific terms and conditions of such legislation, such legislation's impact on the competitive landscape within our markets, or how, if at all, any such legislation might ultimately affect customer demand for our products or our operating results.\nOur compliance with applicable environmental laws is costly and not guaranteed.\nBecause we own and lease real property, various environmental laws may impose liability on us for the costs of cleaning up and responding to hazardous substances that may have been released on our property, including releases unknown to us. These environmental laws and regulations could also require us to pay for environmental remediation and response costs at third-party locations where we disposed of or recycled hazardous substances. We are currently involved in the evaluation and clean-up of a limited number of properties we either currently or previously owned. Although we do not expect that these current matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results, our future costs of complying with the various environmental requirements, as they now exist or may be altered in the future, could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to product quality issues, product liability claims, and other litigation from time to time that could adversely affect our business, reputation, operating results, or financial condition.\nThe manufacture, sale, and use of our products expose us to significant risks associated with product quality issues and product liability claims and other litigation from time to time. If a product liability claim, other claim or series of claims is brought against us for liabilities exceeding our insurance coverage, and it is ultimately determined that we are liable, our business could suffer. While we believe that we appropriately instruct and warn our customers on the proper usage of our products, we cannot ensure that they will implement our instructions accurately or completely. If our products are defective or used incorrectly by our customers, injury may result and this could give rise to product quality issues and/or product liability claims against us, which could result in losses or damages or adversely affect our brand reputation and the marketability of our products, which may negatively impact our business and operating results.\nProduct defects can occur through our own product development, design, and manufacturing processes or through our reliance on third-parties for certain component design and manufacturing activities. Some of our products or product improvements were developed or modified relatively recently and defects or risks that we have not yet identified, such as quality issues or unanticipated use of our products, may give rise to warranty or other quality claims and/or product liability claims. Additionally, we could experience a material design, testing, or manufacturing failure in our products, a quality system failure, failures in our products and other challenges that are associated with our inability to properly manage changes in the suppliers and components that we use in our products, insufficient testing procedures, other safety issues, or heightened regulatory scrutiny that could warrant a recall of some of our products. A recall of some of our products could also result in increased\nproduct liability claims. Unforeseen product quality and/or product liability problems in the development and production of new and existing products could also result in loss of market share, decreased demand, reduced sales, rework costs, and higher warranty expense.\nWe are also subject to other litigation from time to time that could adversely affect our business, reputation, operating results or financial condition.\nWe operate in many different jurisdictions and we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws.\nThe U.S. FCPA and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making certain improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The continued expansion of our international operations could increase the risk of violations of these laws. Significant violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could harm our reputation, disrupt our business, and result in significant fines and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may not achieve our financial projections, sustainability goals, or other business and productivity initiatives, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe generally provide financial projections such as our expected revenue growth and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These financial projections are based on managements assumptions and expectations at the time made. Failure to achieve our financial projections could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe have set certain aspirations and goals related to ESG matters, such as goals to increase battery and hybrid product sales, plans to reduce certain GHG emissions over time, and goals to increase the number of women and racial and ethnic minorities in leadership positions. We also set goals and objectives for the timing of certain accomplishments, initiatives and milestones regarding our business or operating results, including without limitation our recently announced \"Amplifying Maximum Productivity\" or AMP initiative, which is a multi-year initiative intended to result in annualized cost savings of more than $100 million by fiscal 2027, driven by sustainable supply-base, design-to-value, and route-to-market transformation. Whether we achieve our goals and objectives of such initiatives can vary due to a number of factors, including the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is possible that we may be unsuccessful in the achievement of our goals, on a timely basis or at all. A delay, failure or perceived failure or delay to achieve such goals and objectives in the time periods that we anticipate, or at all, could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition, and the public perception of our business.\nWe are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain key executive and employees and successfully implement key employee transitions.\nOur ability to meet our strategic objectives and otherwise profitably grow our business will depend to a significant extent on the continued contributions of our leadership team and our ability to identify, attract, engage, develop, and retain other highly qualified employees worldwide. Competition for these individuals is intense, and we may not succeed in identifying, attracting, or retaining qualified employees. Our executive management team and board of directors have undergone significant changes during the past two years. Losing executive officers or other key employees, failure to identify, attract, or retain qualified leaders in the future, ineffective executive officer or other employee transitions, delays or the inability to hire necessary and qualified office or production employees due to employment conditions or otherwise, or any employee work slowdowns, strikes, or similar actions could make it difficult for us to conduct and manage our business and meet key objectives, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nNot applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur global business operations require the use of various facilities and other properties for manufacturing, distribution, warehousing, engineering and product testing, sales and marketing, and other corporate activities. We generally consider our current facilities to be in good operating condition, suitable for their respective uses, and adequate for our current and future business needs as our business is presently conducted. However, as a matter of course, we review our facilities from time to time as we continue to optimize our global business operations and footprint and may determine that certain of our facilities should be expanded or exited, sold, or utilized in another manner.\nOur significant facilities are listed below by location, ownership, and function as of October 31, 2023:\nLocation Reportable Segment Facility Type/Use Ownership\nUnited States:\nBatesville, Arkansas Professional Manufacturing facility, office, and warehouse Owned/Leased\nEl Cajon, California Professional Manufacturing facility and test site Owned/Leased\nRiverside, California Professional Office and test site Owned/Leased\nSanford, Florida Professional Manufacturing facility Leased\nAnkeny, Iowa Professional & Residential Distribution center Leased\nMount Sterling, Kentucky Professional Manufacturing facility Leased\nIron Mountain, Michigan Professional Manufacturing facility, office, and test site Owned/Leased\nBloomington, Minnesota Other activities Corporate headquarters and test site Owned/Leased\nShakopee, Minnesota Professional & Residential Manufacturing facility Owned\nWindom, Minnesota Professional & Residential Manufacturing facility Owned/Leased\nBeatrice, Nebraska Professional Manufacturing facility, office, and test site Owned/Leased\nOrrville, Ohio Professional Manufacturing facility and office Owned\nWest Salem, Ohio Professional Manufacturing facility and office Owned\nPerry, Oklahoma Professional Manufacturing facility, office, and test site Owned/Leased\nEl Paso, Texas Professional & Residential Manufacturing facility and distribution center Owned/Leased\nWeatherford, Texas Professional Manufacturing facility Owned\nBaraboo, Wisconsin Professional & Residential Distribution center Leased\nLake Mills, Wisconsin Professional Manufacturing facility Owned\nPlymouth, Wisconsin Professional & Residential Distribution center Owned\nTomah, Wisconsin Professional Manufacturing facility and distribution center Owned/Leased\nInternational Countries:\nBeverley, Australia Professional Manufacturing facility and office Owned\nBraeside, Australia Professional & Residential Distribution center Leased\nOevel, Belgium Professional & Residential Distribution center Owned/Leased\nXiamen City, China Professional & Residential Manufacturing facility Leased\nAlthengstett, Germany Professional Manufacturing facility and office Owned\nFiano Romano, Italy Professional Manufacturing facility and office Owned/Leased\nJuarez, Mexico Professional & Residential Manufacturing facility Leased\nMonterrey, Mexico Professional & Residential Manufacturing facility Leased\nUstron, Poland Professional Manufacturing facility Owned\nPloiesti, Romania Professional Manufacturing facility and test site Owned\nHertfordshire, United Kingdom Professional & Residential Manufacturing facility, office, and test site Owned ITEM 3.

For a description of our material legal proceedings, refer to the heading titled \"Litigation\" within Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated into this Item 3 by reference.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nCommon Stock and Cash Dividends\nOur common stock is listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol \"TTC.\" As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, we had 175,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, authorized, and 103,843,485 and 103,969,805 shares of common stock outstanding, respectively. In each quarter of fiscal 2023, our Board of Directors declared a common stock cash dividend of $0.34 per share, which was a 13.3 percent increase over our common stock cash dividend of $0.30 per share paid in each quarter of fiscal 2022. As announced on December 12, 2023, our Board of Directors increased our fiscal 2024 first quarter common stock cash dividend by 5.9 percent to $0.36 per share. Future common stock cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Restrictions on our ability to pay dividends are disclosed in Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nPreferred Stock\nAs of October 31, 2023 and 2022, we had 1,000,000 voting shares and 850,000 non-voting shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share, authorized, none of which were outstanding.\nShareholders\nAs of December 13, 2023, we had 2,450 shareholders of record.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to shares of our common stock purchased by the company during each of the three fiscal months in our fourth quarter ended October 31, 2023:\nPeriod Total Number of Shares (or Units) Purchased1, 2, 3\nAverage Price Paid per Share (or Unit) Total Number of Shares (or Units) Purchased As Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs1, 2\nMaximum Number of Shares (or Units) that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs1, 2\nAugust 5, 2023 through September 1, 2023 - $ - - 6,949,491\nSeptember 2, 2023 through September 29, 2023 - - - 6,949,491\nSeptember 30, 2023 through October 31, 2023 1,560 86.01 - 6,949,491\nTotal 1,560 $ 86.01 -\n1 On December 4, 2018, the companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 5,000,000 shares of the companys common stock in open-market or in privately negotiated transactions.

ITEM 6. [RESERVED] ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is intended to provide a reader of our Consolidated Financial Statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and all references in this MD&A to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements can be found in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUnless expressly stated otherwise, the comparisons presented in this MD&A refer to the year-over-year comparison of changes in our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022. Discussion of fiscal 2021 items and the year-over-year comparison of changes in our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 can be found in Part II, Item 7, \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022. Statements that are not historical are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested throughout this MD&A.\nOur MD&A is presented as follows:\nCompany Overview\nResults of Operations\nBusiness Segments\nFinancial Position\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThroughout this MD&A, we have provided financial and liquidity measures that are not calculated or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP (\"non-GAAP financial measures,\" \"adjusted\" before specified financial measures, and \"non-GAAP liquidity measures\"), as information supplemental and in addition to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provide investors with useful supplemental financial information to better understand our core operational performance and cash flows. These non-GAAP financial measures, however, should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable reported U.S. GAAP financial measures are included in the section titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW\nExecutive Summary\nOur fiscal 2023 results included the following items of significance that are provided in summary format here and described in greater detail throughout the \"Results of Operations,\" \"Business Segments,\" and \"Financial Position\" sections:\nConsolidated net sales for fiscal 2023 were $4,553.2 million, an increase of 0.9 percent compared to $4,514.7 million in fiscal 2022.\nProfessional segment net sales for fiscal 2023 were $3,674.6 million, an increase of 7.1 percent compared to $3,429.6 million in fiscal 2022.\nResidential segment net sales for fiscal 2023 were $854.2 million, a decrease of 20.1 percent compared to $1,068.6 million in fiscal 2022.\nGross margin was 34.6 percent in fiscal 2023, an increase of 130 basis points compared to 33.3 percent in fiscal 2022.\nAdjusted gross margin was 34.7 percent in fiscal 2023, an increase of 130 basis points compared to 33.4 percent in fiscal 2022.\nSG&A expense as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2023 was 21.8 percent, an increase of 130 basis points compared to 20.5 percent in fiscal 2022.\nNet earnings for fiscal 2023 were $329.7 million, or $3.13 per diluted share, compared to $443.3 million, or $4.20 per diluted share, in fiscal 2022.\nAdjusted net earnings for fiscal 2023 were $443.5 million, or $4.21 per diluted share, compared to $444.2 million, or $4.20 per diluted share, in fiscal 2022.\nField inventory was higher as of the end of fiscal 2023 compared to the end of fiscal 2022, primarily driven by channel replenishment and lower than anticipated retail demand from homeowners who prefer professional solutions.\nOur order backlog represents unfulfilled customer orders at a point in time. Our order backlog (including shipments beyond 12 months) decreased $343.4 million to $1,965.7 million as of October 31, 2023 from $2,309.1 million as of October 31, 2022, primarily driven by improved manufacturing output. Our order backlog remains significantly elevated over what the company would consider normal, due to demand for golf and grounds equipment and underground and specialty construction products continuing to outpace production of such products.\nPlease refer to the section titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable reported U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nWe continued our history of paying quarterly cash dividends throughout fiscal 2023 and increased our fiscal 2023 quarterly cash dividend by 13.3 percent to $0.34 per share compared to $0.30 per share paid in fiscal 2022. We also repurchased shares of our common stock under our Board authorized repurchase program, thereby reducing our total shares outstanding. As a result of the combination of quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases, we returned $201.9 million of cash to our shareholders during fiscal 2023. As of October 31, 2023, we had a strong liquidity profile with available liquidity of $750.5 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $193.1 million and availability under our revolving credit facility of $557.4 million.\nMulti-Year Employee Initiative\nOur current multi-year employee initiative, \"Drive for Five,\" which began in fiscal 2022, is intended to align and engage employees on furthering our profitable growth by offering innovative business and product categories to serve our customers. As such, the core focus of this initiative is our goal of exceeding $5.0 billion in net sales through organic growth, while continuing our historical focus on improving profitability, by the end of fiscal 2024. We believe this goal enhances the innovation and growth momentum for the organization.\nAMP Initiative\nWe recently announced a new \"Amplifying Maximum Productivity\" or AMP initiative, which is a multi-year initiative intended to result in annualized cost savings of more than $100 million by fiscal 2027, driven by sustainable supply-base, design-to-value, and route-to-market transformation. We expect to reinvest a portion of the savings from this initiative to drive further innovation and growth.\nAcquisition of Intimidator Group\nOn January 13, 2022, during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed our acquisition of Intimidator for net aggregate purchase consideration of $399.8 million. Intimidator primarily designs, manufactures, markets, and sells a commercial-grade line of zero-turn mowers under the Spartan brand, which are intended to provide innovative turf management solutions to landscape contractors and other customers including homeowners who prefer professional solutions. The acquisition of Intimidator broadened our Professional reportable segment and expanded our manufacturing footprint and dealer network. Subsequent to the closing date, results of operations for Intimidator have been included within our Professional reportable segment within our Consolidated Financial Statements and had an incremental impact to our Professional reportable segment net sales for the first twelve months post acquisition, or through the first quarter of fiscal 2023. For additional information regarding the Intimidator acquisition, refer to Note 2, Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nImpairment\nDuring the preparation of our financial statements for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we identified deterioration in year-to-date fiscal 2023 results of Intimidator compared to previous expectations and resulting downward revisions to our projected future results of Intimidator made during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 as part of our annual long range strategic planning process, including future expected cash flows, which were significantly lower than previously expected. The underperformance was attributable to summer seasonality trends that did not materialize primarily due to reduced retail demand from homeowners who prefer professional solutions. This reduced retail demand from homeowners who prefer professional solutions was driven by persistent hot and dry weather patterns across key regions, coupled with a number of macro factors, including higher interest rates, economic uncertainty, and consumer spending preferences following the exceptional demand during the pandemic. Additionally, we had previously replenished the Intimidator customer channel, which, combined with the reduced retail demand, caused a significant reduction in shipments and customer reorders during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, as well as a material reduction in projected future financial results for Intimidator.\nBased on the above factors, we concluded it was more likely than not that the indefinite-lived Spartan trade name intangible asset was impaired and that the fair value of the Intimidator reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. As such, we\nperformed quantitative impairment analyses to compare the fair value of the Spartan trade name intangible asset and the Intimidator reporting unit with their respective carrying amounts.\nAs a result of these analyses, at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we recorded an impairment charge of $18.0 million related to the indefinite-lived Spartan trade name intangible asset reported under the Professional segment. Further, during the same period, we recorded an impairment charge of $133.3 million related to goodwill of the Intimidator reporting unit also reported under the Professional segment. Subsequent to these impairment charges, the remaining balance of the indefinite-lived Spartan trade name intangible asset is $81.1 million and the remaining balance of goodwill for the Intimidator reporting unit is $30.5 million. These impairment charges are included in the Non-cash impairment charges caption on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. These impairment charges resulted in a $36.7 million income tax benefit (deferred tax asset) associated with the remaining tax deductible basis in goodwill and other intangible assets.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\nConsolidated net sales in fiscal 2023 were $4,553.2 million compared to $4,514.7 million in fiscal 2022, an increase of 0.9 percent. This net sales increase was primarily driven by net price realization, higher shipments of Professional segment products, and the incremental net sales attributable to the acquisition of Intimidator, partially offset by lower shipments of Residential segment products.\nNet sales in international markets were $947.7 million for fiscal 2023 compared to $879.2 million in fiscal 2022, an increase of 7.8 percent. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease in our net sales of $5.5 million in fiscal 2023. The international net sales increase was primarily driven by higher shipments and net price realization in the Professional segment, partially offset by lower shipments in the Residential segment.\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations as a percentage of our consolidated net sales:\nFiscal Years Ended October 31 2023 2022\nNet sales 100.0 % 100.0 %\nCost of sales (65.4) (66.7)\nGross margin 34.6 33.3\nSG&A expense (21.8) (20.5)\nNon-cash impairment charges (3.3) -\nOperating earnings 9.5 12.8\nInterest expense (1.3) (0.8)\nOther income, net 0.6 0.2\nEarnings before income taxes 8.8 12.2\nProvision for income taxes (1.6) (2.4)\nNet earnings 7.2 % 9.8 %\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit represents net sales less cost of sales and gross margin represents gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Related Data, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within the section entitled \"Cost of Sales,\" for a description of expenses included in cost of sales. Gross profit for fiscal 2023 was $1,577.6 million, up 4.9 percent compared to gross profit of $1,504.6 million in fiscal 2022. Gross margin was 34.6 percent in fiscal 2023 compared to 33.3 percent in fiscal 2022, an increase of 130 basis points. The increase in gross margin in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to net price realization and productivity improvements, partially offset by higher material costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative (\"SG&A\") Expense\nSG&A expense increased $66.7 million, or 7.2 percent, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Related Data, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within the section entitled \"Selling, General and Administrative Expense\" for a description of expenses included in SG&A expense. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense was 21.8 percent in fiscal 2023 compared to 20.5 percent in fiscal 2022, an increase of 130 basis points. The increase in SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by higher corporate expenses, higher marketing and warranty costs, and increased investment in research and engineering.\nNon-Cash Impairment Charges\nWe recorded non-cash impairment charges of $151.3 million within our Professional segment related to Intimidator in fiscal 2023. No impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2022.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest costs incurred on outstanding borrowings related to our fixed and variable interest rate debt arrangements, as well as amortization of the debt issuance costs associated with our debt arrangements. Interest expense for fiscal 2023 increased $23.0 million compared to fiscal 2022. This increase was driven by higher average interest rates in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net for fiscal 2023 was $28.5 million compared to $12.5 million in fiscal 2022, an increase of $16.0 million. This increase in other income, net was primarily due to higher income from our Red Iron joint venture and the favorable impact from derivative instruments in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 17.7 percent compared to 19.8 percent in fiscal 2022. The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was primarily due to the impact of non-cash impairment charges and higher tax benefits recorded as excess tax deductions for stock compensation during fiscal 2023.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 20.4 percent, compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 20.2 percent in fiscal 2022. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable reported U.S. GAAP financial measures are included in the section titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nNet Earnings and Net Earnings Per Diluted Share\nFiscal 2023 net earnings were $329.7 million compared to $443.3 million in fiscal 2022, a decrease of 25.6 percent. Fiscal 2023 diluted net earnings per share were $3.13, a decrease of 25.5 percent from $4.20 per diluted share in fiscal 2022. The decrease in net earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by the non-cash impairment charges, higher interest expense, and lower Residential segment earnings, partially offset by strong Professional segment earnings excluding the non-cash impairment charges and higher income from our Red Iron joint venture.\nAdjusted net earnings for fiscal 2023 were $443.5 million, or $4.21 per diluted share, compared to $444.2 million, or $4.20 per diluted share, in fiscal 2022. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable reported U.S. GAAP financial measures are included in the section titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nAs more fully described in Note 3, Segment Data, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we operate in two reportable business segments: Professional and Residential. Segment earnings for our Professional and Residential reportable segments are defined as earnings from operations plus other income, net. Our remaining activities consisting of a wholly-owned domestic distribution company, Red Iron joint venture, certain corporate activities, and the elimination of intersegment revenues and expenses, are presented as \"Other\" due to their insignificance. Corporate activities include general corporate expenditures, such as finance, human resources, legal, information technology, public relations, business development, and similar activities, as well as other unallocated corporate assets and liabilities, such as corporate facilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities. The following information provides perspective on the net sales and operating results of our reportable business segments and Other activities.\nProfessional Segment\nProfessional segment net sales represented 80.7 percent and 76.0 percent of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The following table presents our Professional segment's net sales, earnings, and earnings as a percentage of net sales (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended October 31 2023 2022\nNet sales $ 3,674.6 $ 3,429.6\nPercentage change from prior year 7.1 % 17.1 %\nSegment earnings $ 509.1 $ 584.0\nSegment earnings as a percentage of segment net sales 13.9 % 17.0 %\nProfessional Segment Net Sales\nNet sales for our Professional segment in fiscal 2023 increased 7.1 percent compared to fiscal 2022. This increase was primarily driven by higher shipments of underground and specialty construction, and golf and grounds products, net price realization, and the incremental net sales attributable to the acquisition of Intimidator, partially offset by lower shipments of contractor-grade lawn care equipment.\nProfessional Segment Earnings\nProfessional segment earnings decreased 12.8 percent in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, and when expressed as a percentage of Professional segment net sales, decreased to 13.9 percent from 17.0 percent. The decrease in Professional segment earnings as a percentage of Professional segment net sales for fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by the non-cash impairment charges and higher material costs, partially offset by net price realization and productivity improvements.\nResidential Segment\nResidential segment net sales represented 18.8 percent and 23.7 percent of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The following table presents our Residential segment's net sales, earnings, and earnings as a percentage of net sales (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended October 31 2023 2022\nNet sales $ 854.2 $ 1,068.6\nPercentage change from prior year (20.1) % 5.8 %\nSegment earnings $ 68.9 $ 112.7\nSegment earnings as a percentage of segment net sales 8.1 % 10.5 %\nResidential Segment Net Sales\nNet sales for our Residential segment in fiscal 2023 decreased by 20.1 percent compared to fiscal 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by lower shipments of products broadly across the segment, partially offset by net price realization.\nResidential Segment Earnings\nResidential segment earnings decreased 38.9 percent in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, and when expressed as a percentage of Residential segment net sales, decreased to 8.1 percent from 10.5 percent. This Residential segment earnings decrease as a percentage of Residential segment net sales was primarily driven by lower sales volume and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by net price realization.\nOther Activities\nNet sales for our Other activities consist of sales from a wholly-owned domestic distribution company less intercompany sales from our Professional and Residential business segments to the wholly-owned domestic distribution company. Net sales for our Other activities represented 0.5 percent and 0.3 percent of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table presents net sales and operating loss for our Other activities (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended October 31 2023 2022\nNet sales $ 24.4 $ 16.5\nPercentage change from prior year 47.9 % (17.2) %\nOperating loss $ (177.5) $ (144.2)\nOther Net Sales\nNet sales for our Other activities includes sales from our wholly-owned domestic distribution company net of intersegment sales from the Professional and Residential segments to the distribution company. Net sales for our Other activities in fiscal 2023 increased $7.9 million compared to fiscal 2022.\nOther Operating Loss\nOperating loss for our Other activities increased $33.3 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. This year-over-year operating loss increase was primarily driven by higher interest expense, higher corporate expenses, and restructuring charges, partially offset by higher income from our Red Iron joint venture and the favorable impact from derivative instruments.\nFINANCIAL POSITION\nWorking Capital\nThe macroeconomic environment remains challenging, but our supply chain is beginning to stabilize. Our continued goal is to maintain requisite inventory levels to meet our anticipated production requirements, avoid manufacturing delays, and meet the demand for our products, as well as ensure service parts availability for our customers. The following table highlights several key measures of our working capital performance (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended October 31 2023 2022\nAverage receivables, net $ 379.2 $ 351.7\nAverage inventories, net $ 1,134.5 $ 914.4\nAverage accounts payable $ 450.9 $ 494.6\nAverage days outstanding for receivables 30.4 28.4\nAverage inventory turnover (times per fiscal year) 2.6 3.3\nAs of the end of fiscal 2023, our average net working capital was 23.3 percent compared to 17.1 percent as of the end of fiscal 2022. We calculate our average net working capital as average net accounts receivable plus average net inventory, less average accounts payable as a percentage of net sales for a twelve month period.\nThe following factors impacted our average net working capital during fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022:\nAverage net receivables increased by 7.8 percent, primarily driven by payment terms. Our average days outstanding for receivables increased to 30.4 days in fiscal 2023 compared to 28.4 days in fiscal 2022.\nAverage net inventories increased by 24.1 percent, primarily due to higher finished goods resulting from decreased demand for solutions sold to homeowners.\nAverage accounts payable decreased by 8.8 percent, primarily driven by a reduction in purchases year-over-year.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe make ongoing capital investments in our property, plant, and equipment and believe that in periods of normalized supply chain conditions our historical capital investments in our manufacturing facilities and other capital assets will increase the production capacity and efficiencies of our operations to better enable us to meet the needs of our customers. Fiscal 2023 capital expenditures of $149.5 million were $6.0 million higher than our fiscal 2022 capital expenditures of $143.5 million.\nCash Flows\nCash flows provided by/(used in) operating, investing, and financing activities during the past two fiscal years are shown in the following table (dollars in millions):\nCash Provided by/\n(Used in)\nFiscal Years Ended October 31 2023 2022\nOperating activities $ 306.8 $ 297.2\nInvesting activities (157.7) (548.3)\nFinancing activities (147.5) 42.2\nEffect of exchange rates on cash 3.3 (8.5)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 4.9 (217.4)\nCash and cash equivalents as of the end of the fiscal period $ 193.1 $ 188.2\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur primary source of funds is cash generated from operations. In fiscal 2023, cash provided by operating activities increased by $9.6 million, or 3.2 percent, from fiscal 2022.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nAcquisitions and capital expenditures are a significant use of our capital resources. These investments are intended to enable sales growth in new, existing, and expanding markets, help us meet product demand, and increase our manufacturing efficiencies and capacity. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2023 decreased by $390.6 million from fiscal 2022. This decrease was primarily due to cash used to acquire Intimidator in fiscal 2022 that was not repeated.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities in fiscal 2023 was $147.5 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of $42.2 million in fiscal 2022. This change in cash flows from financing activities was mainly due to lower net borrowings, partially offset by lower share repurchases, in each case during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The net borrowings incurred during fiscal 2022 were used in part to acquire Intimidator.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of October 31, 2023, we had available liquidity of $750.5 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $193.1 million, of which $91.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries, and availability under our revolving credit facility of $557.4 million.\nWe expect that $32.8 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested. Should these cash and cash equivalents be distributed in the future in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to foreign withholding taxes, state income taxes, and/or additional federal taxes for currency fluctuations. As of October 31, 2023, the unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to our investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries, and any withholding, state, or additional federal taxes upon any future repatriation, are not material and have not been recorded.\nWe believe our current liquidity position, including the funds available through existing, and potential future, financing arrangements and projected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to provide the necessary capital resources for our anticipated working capital needs, payroll, and other administrative costs, capital expenditures, lease payments, purchase commitments, contractual obligations, acquisitions, investments, establishment of new facilities, expansion and renovation of existing facilities, financing receivables from customers that are not financed with Red Iron or other third-party financial institutions, contingent consideration payments, debt repayments, interest payments, quarterly cash dividend payments, and common stock repurchases, all as applicable, for at least the next twelve months.\nIndebtedness\nThe following is a summary of our indebtedness (dollars in millions):\nOctober 31 2023 2022\nRevolving credit facility, due October 2026 $ 40.0 $ -\n$270 million term loan, due October 2026 270.0 270.0\n$200 million term loan, due April 2027 200.0 200.0\n3.81% series A senior notes, due June 2029 100.0 100.0\n3.91% series B senior notes, due June 2031 100.0 100.0\n3.97% senior notes, due June 2032 100.0 100.0\n7.8% debentures, due June 2027 100.0 100.0\n6.625% senior notes, due May 2037 124.2 124.1\nLess: unamortized debt issuance costs 2.7 3.3\nLong-term debt $ 1,031.5 $ 990.8\nPrincipal payments required on our outstanding indebtedness, based on the maturity dates defined within our debt arrangements, for each of the succeeding fiscal years is as follows (dollars in millions):\nSucceeding fiscal year Principal payments\n2024 $ -\n2025 37.0\n2026 303.0\n2027 270.0\n2028 -\nThereafter 425.0\nTotal principal payments $ 1,035.0\nInterest payments required on our outstanding indebtedness, assuming no prepayments of indebtedness, for each of the succeeding fiscal years is as follows (dollars in millions):\nSucceeding fiscal year Interest payments\n2024 $ 57.3\n2025 56.6\n2026 53.7\n2027 30.1\n2028 20.0\nThereafter 97.6\nInterest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate as of October 31, 2023.\nOur revolving credit facility has a borrowing capacity of up to $600.0 million that matures on October 5, 2026. Included in the revolving credit facility is a $10.0 million sublimit for standby letters of credit and a $30.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. At our election, and with the approval of the named borrowers on the revolving credit facility and the election of the lenders to fund such increase, the aggregate maximum principal amount available under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an amount of up to $300.0 million. As of October 31, 2023 we had $40.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility\nand $2.6 million outstanding under the sublimit for standby letters of credit, resulting in $557.4 million of unutilized availability under our revolving credit facility. As of October 31, 2022 we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and $3.1 million outstanding under the sublimit for standby letters of credit, resulting in $596.9 million of unutilized availability under our revolving credit facility. As of October 31, 2023, our debt ratings for long-term unsecured senior, non-credit enhanced debt by Standard and Poor's Ratings Group and by Moody's Investors Service were BBB and Baa1, respectively, and in both cases with a stable outlook.\nThe agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness are described in Note 6, Indebtedness, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our revolving credit facility and term loan credit agreements, indentures and private placement note purchase agreements.\nCapital Structure\nThe following table details the components of our capital structure and debt-to-capitalization ratio (dollars in millions, except percentage data):\nOctober 31 2023 2022\nLong-term debt $ 1,031.5 $ 990.8\nStockholders' equity $ 1,510.9 $ 1,351.7\nDebt-to-capitalization ratio 40.6 % 42.3 %\nOur debt-to-capitalization ratio decreased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to our continued profitability.\nCash Dividends\nIn each quarter of fiscal 2023, our Board of Directors declared a common stock cash dividend of $0.34 per share, which was a 13.3 percent increase over our common stock cash dividend of $0.30 per share paid each quarter in fiscal 2022. On December 12, 2023, our Board of Directors increased our fiscal 2024 first quarter common stock cash dividend by 5.9 percent to $0.36 per share. Future common stock cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\nShare Repurchases\nOur Board authorized stock repurchase program provides shares for use in connection with our stock-based compensation plans, among other uses, and has no expiration. The following table provides information with respect to repurchases of our common stock during the past two fiscal years (dollars in millions, except share and per share data):\nFiscal Years Ended October 31 2023 2022\nShares of Board authorized common stock purchased 577,115 1,525,856\nCost to repurchase common stock $ 60.0 $ 140.0\nAverage price paid per share $ 103.97 $ 91.75\nAs of October 31, 2023, 6,949,491 shares remained available for repurchase under our Board authorized stock repurchase program. We currently expect to continue share repurchases in fiscal 2024, depending on our cash balance, debt repayments, common stock price and other market conditions, our anticipated working capital needs, and/or other factors.\nCustomer Financing\nInventory Financing Arrangements\nWe are party to inventory financing arrangements with Red Iron, HCFC, and other third-party financial institutions (collectively, the \"financial institutions\") which provide inventory financing to certain dealers and distributors of certain of our products in the U.S. and internationally. These financing arrangements are structured as an advance in the form of a payment by the financial institutions to us on behalf of a distributor or dealer with respect to invoices financed by the financial institution. These payments extinguish the obligation of the dealer or distributor to make payment to us under the terms of the applicable invoice.\nUnder separate agreements between the financial institutions and the dealers and distributors, the financial institutions provide loans to the dealers and distributors for the advances paid by the financial institutions to us. Under these financing arrangements, down payments are not required, and depending on the finance program for each product line, finance charges are incurred by us, shared between us and the distributor and/or the dealer, or paid by the distributor or dealer. The financial institutions retain a security interest in the distributors' and dealers' financed inventories and such inventories are monitored regularly through audits. Financing terms to the distributors and dealers require payment as the inventory, which secures the indebtedness, is sold to end-users or when payment otherwise become due under the agreements between the financial institutions and the distributors and dealers, whichever occurs first. Rates are generally indexed to the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (\"SOFR\"), or an alternative variable rate, plus a fixed percentage that differs based on whether the financing is for a distributor or dealer. Rates may also vary based on the product that is financed.\nThe net amount of receivables financed for dealers and distributors under the arrangement with Red Iron during fiscal 2023 and 2022 was $2,789.5 million and $2,627.5 million, respectively. The total amount of net receivables outstanding under the arrangement with Red Iron as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1,019.0 million and $776.1 million, respectively. The total amount of receivables due from Red Iron to us as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 were $34.4 million and $17.7 million, respectively.\nThe net amount of receivables financed for dealers and distributors under the arrangements with HCFC and the other third-party financial institutions during fiscal 2023 and 2022 was $545.4 million and $633.5 million, respectively. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, $234.7 million and $220.0 million, respectively, of receivables financed by HCFC and the other third-party financial institutions were outstanding.\nInventory Repurchase Agreements\nWe have entered into a limited inventory repurchase agreement with Red Iron and HCFC under which we have agreed to repurchase certain repossessed products, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $7.5 million in a calendar year.\nWe have also entered into inventory repurchase agreements with the other third-party financial institutions under which we have agreed to repurchase certain repossessed products. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, we were contingently liable to repurchase up to a maximum amount of $32.2 million and $80.0 million of repossessed inventory, respectively.\nOur financial exposure under these inventory repurchase agreements is limited to the difference between the amount paid to Red Iron, HCFC or other third-party financing institutions for repurchases of inventory and the amount received upon subsequent resale of the repossessed product. We have repurchased immaterial amounts of inventory pursuant to such arrangements over the past three fiscal years. However, a decline in retail sales or financial difficulties of our distributors or dealers could cause this situation to change and thereby require us to repurchase financed product, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nEnd-User Financing\nWe have agreements with third-party financing companies to provide financing options to end-customers throughout the world. The purpose of these agreements is to provide end-users of our products alternative financing options when purchasing our products. We have no material contingent liabilities for residual value or credit collection risk under these agreements with third-party financing companies.\nFrom time to time, we enter into agreements where we provide recourse to third-party finance companies in the event of default by the customer for financing payments to the third-party finance company. We may recover a portion of any required recourse payments incurred under these agreements from repossession and resale of the equipment collateralizing the receivables. Our maximum exposure for credit collection under those arrangements as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 was $5.2 million and $8.6 million, respectively.\nTermination or any material change to the terms of our end-user financing arrangements, availability of credit for our customers, including any delay in securing replacement credit sources, or significant financed product repurchase requirements could have a material adverse impact on our future operating results.\nOpen Account Terms\nWe continue to provide financing in the form of open account terms directly to home centers and mass retailers, general line irrigation dealers, certain domestic and international distributors and dealers, ag-irrigation dealers and distributors, government customers, and rental companies.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe have provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as information supplemental and in addition to the most directly comparable financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions and assessing liquidity because we believe they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our core operational performance and cash flows, as a measure of our liquidity, and provide us with a better understanding of how to allocate resources to both ongoing and prospective business initiatives. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate our internal comparisons to both our historical operating results and to our competitors' operating results by factoring out potential differences caused by charges and benefits not related to our regular, ongoing business, including, without limitation, certain non-cash, large, and/or unpredictable charges and benefits; acquisitions and dispositions; legal judgments, settlements, or other matters; and tax positions.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provide investors with useful supplemental financial information to better understand our core operational performance and cash flows. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of financial performance measures calculated and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP to the most directly comparable non-GAAP financial performance measures for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 (dollars in millions, except per share and percentage data):\nFiscal Years Ended October 31, 2023 October 31, 2022\nGross profit $ 1,577.6 $ 1,504.6\nAcquisition-related costs1\n0.2 1.6\nRestructuring charges2\n1.2 -\nAdjusted gross profit $ 1,579.0 $ 1,506.2\nGross margin 34.6 % 33.3 %\nAcquisition-related costs1\n- % 0.1 %\nRestructuring charges2\n0.1 % - %\nAdjusted gross margin 34.7 % 33.4 %\nOperating earnings $ 430.7 $ 575.7\nAcquisition-related costs1\n0.4 4.0\nRestructuring charges2\n5.0 -\nNon-cash impairment charges3\n151.3 -\nAdjusted operating earnings $ 587.4 $ 579.7\nOperating earnings margin 9.5 % 12.8 %\nRestructuring charges2\n0.1 % - %\nNon-cash impairment charges3\n3.3 % - %\nAdjusted operating earnings margin 12.9 % 12.8 %\nEarnings before income taxes $ 400.5 $ 552.5\nAcquisition-related costs1\n0.4 4.0\nRestructuring charges2\n5.0 -\nNon-cash impairment charges3\n151.3 -\nAdjusted earnings before income taxes $ 557.2 $ 556.5\nIncome tax provision $ 70.8 $ 109.2\nAcquisition-related costs1\n- 0.8\nRestructuring charges2\n1.1 -\nNon-cash impairment charges3\n36.7 -\nTax impact of stock-based compensation4\n5.1 2.3\nAdjusted income tax provision $ 113.7 $ 112.3\nNet earnings $ 329.7 $ 443.3\nAcquisition-related costs1\n0.4 3.2\nRestructuring charges2\n3.9 -\nNon-cash impairment charges3\n114.6 -\nTax impact of stock-based compensation4\n(5.1) (2.3)\nAdjusted net earnings $ 443.5 $ 444.2\nNet earnings per diluted share $ 3.13 $ 4.20\nAcquisition-related costs1\n- 0.03\nRestructuring charges2\n0.04 -\nNon-cash impairment charges3\n1.09 -\nTax impact of stock-based compensation4\n(0.05) (0.03)\nAdjusted net earnings per diluted share $ 4.21 $ 4.20\nEffective tax rate 17.7 % 19.8 %\nNon-cash impairment charges3\n1.5 % - %\nTax impact of stock-based compensation4\n1.2 % 0.4 %\nAdjusted effective tax rate 20.4 % 20.2 %\n1 On January 13, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Intimidator. Acquisition-related costs for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023 represent integration costs incurred in connection with the acquisition. Acquisition-related costs for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022 represent transaction and integration costs incurred in connection with the acquisition. For additional information regarding this acquisition, refer to Note 2, Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2 In October of fiscal 2023, we initiated a restructuring program expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The anticipated costs associated with the program include severance, termination benefits, and other exit-related expenses. Restructuring charges for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023 represent accrued severance costs.\n3 At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we recorded non-cash impairment charges within our Professional reportable segment related to the Intimidator operating segment, as discussed in more detail under the heading \"Company Overview-Impairment\" in this section.\n4 The accounting standards codification guidance governing employee stock-based compensation requires that any excess tax deduction for stock-based compensation be immediately recorded within income tax expense. Employee stock-based compensation activity, including the exercise of stock options, can be unpredictable and can significantly impact our net earnings, net earnings per diluted share, and effective tax rate. These amounts represent the discrete tax benefits recorded as excess tax deductions for stock-based compensation during the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Liquidity Measures\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from insurance claim. Free cash flow conversion percentage represents free cash flow as a percentage of net earnings. We consider free cash flow and free cash flow conversion percentage to be non-GAAP liquidity measures that provide useful information to management and investors about our ability to convert net earnings into cash resources that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value, fund ongoing and prospective business initiatives, and strengthen our Consolidated Balance Sheets, after reinvesting in necessary capital expenditures required to maintain and grow our business.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion percentage to net cash provided by operating activities, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022 (dollars in millions, except percentage data):\nFiscal Years Ended October 31, 2023 October 31, 2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 306.8 $ 297.2\nLess: Purchases of property, plant and equipment, net of proceeds from insurance claim 142.4 143.5\nFree cash flow 164.4 153.7\nNet earnings $ 329.7 $ 443.3\nFree cash flow conversion percentage 49.9 % 34.7 %\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, we must make decisions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, we apply judgment based on our understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances, historical experience, and actuarial and other independent external third-party specialist valuations, when applicable. As a result, actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of those significant accounting policies require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments or estimates. An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (i) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and susceptible to change at the time the accounting estimate is made and different estimates reasonably could have been used and (ii) changes in the estimate may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. Our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following:\nSales Promotions and Incentives\nWe recognize revenues based on the transaction price of the good or service sold to our customers, which is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring product or rendering services pursuant to the terms of the contract with a customer. The amount of consideration we receive and the revenue we recognize varies with changes in the variable consideration associated with the estimated expense of certain of our sales promotions and incentives programs offered to customers that are determined to represent price concessions. The estimated expense of each sales promotion and incentive program is classified and recorded as a reduction from gross sales or as a component of SG&A expense within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings when revenue is recognized, depending on the nature of the respective program. Generally, the cost of a program is recorded as a reduction from gross sales when revenue is recognized and thus is considered to be variable consideration if the expense is determined to represent a price concession because the program either: (i) results in an immediate reduction of the transaction price with no anticipated future costs or consideration to be provided to the customer or (ii) we anticipate a future cost based on historical or expected future business practice for which we do not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the future consideration provided to the customer under the program. In other circumstances, the anticipated future cost of a program based on historical or expected future business practice is recorded as SG&A expense because we receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the future consideration provided to the customer under the program.\nExamples of significant sales promotions and incentive programs that are considered to be variable consideration because the cost of the program is classified as a reduction from gross sales are as follows:\nOff-Invoice Discounts: Our off-invoice discounts represent an immediate reduction in the selling price of our products that is realized at the time of sale with no anticipated future cost or consideration provided to the customer.\nRebate Programs: Our rebate programs are generally based on claims submitted from either our direct customers or end-users of our products or are based on our purchase or retail sales goals for our direct customers of certain quantities or mixes of product during a specified time period, depending upon the program. The amount of the rebate varies based on the specific program and is either a dollar amount or a percentage of the purchase price and can also be based on actual retail price as compared to our selling price. Consideration is typically provided to our customers for our rebate programs after the initial sale of our products to our direct customers and thus, there is generally an anticipated future cost at the time revenue is recognized based on historical and expected future business practice.\nFinancing Programs: Our financing programs consist of wholesale floor plan financing with Red Iron and separate third-party financial institutions and end-user retail financing. Costs incurred for wholesale floor plan financing programs represent financing costs associated with programs under which we share the expense of financing distributor and dealer inventories through third-party financing arrangements for a specific period of time. This charge represents interest for a pre-established length of time based on a predefined rate from the contract between the company and Red Iron or the separate third-party financial institution to finance distributor and dealer inventory purchases. End-user retail financing is similar to floor planning with the difference being that retail financing programs are offered to end-user customers under which we, at our discretion, may pay a portion of interest costs on behalf of end-users for financing purchases of our equipment.\nExamples of significant sales promotions and incentive programs that are not considered to be variable consideration because the cost of the program is classified as a component of SG&A expense are as follows:\nCommissions Paid to Distributors and Dealers: For certain products, we use a distribution network of distributors and dealers that purchase and take possession of products for sale to the end customer. We also have dealers and distributors that act as sales agents for us on certain products using a direct-selling type model. Under this direct-selling type model, our network of distributors and dealers facilitates a sale directly to the dealer or end-user customer on our behalf. Commissions to distributors and dealers in these instances represent commission payments to sales agents that are also our customers. In addition, TTC dealers are often paid a commission to set up and deliver riding product purchased at certain mass retailers and home centers.\nCooperative Advertising: Cooperative advertising programs are based on advertising costs incurred by distributors and dealers for promoting our products. We support a portion of those advertising costs in which claims are submitted by the distributor or dealer along with evidence of the advertising material procured/produced and evidence of the cost incurred in the form of third-party invoices or receipts.\nRegardless of classification of the cost of the sales promotion and incentive program within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, we record an accrual within the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the estimated future expense of certain of our sales promotion and incentive programs for which we anticipate a future cost based on historical or expected future business practice by using the expected value method and applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under the accounting standards codification guidance for revenue from contracts with customers. Under such approach, our determination of variable consideration associated with the estimated expense of certain of our sales promotions and incentives programs is primarily based on the terms of the sales arrangements and sales promotion and incentive programs with customers, historical payment and rebate claims experience, field inventory levels, quantity or mix of products purchased, projected sales volumes, types of programs offered, and expectations for the acceptance of sales promotion and incentive programs offered in the future or changes in other relevant trends.\nOf our sales promotion and incentive programs that are considered to be variable consideration, our off-invoice discounts and financing programs are less subject to complex judgment or estimates as compared to our rebate programs, which are subject to a more significant level of estimation uncertainty as they require inputs and assumptions that are more susceptible to change or subjectivity. Specifically, our rebate programs are primarily sensitive to fluctuations in historical payment and rebate claims experience as compared to actual realized payment and rebate claims, field inventory levels, and projected wholesale and retail sales volumes and the quantity or mix of products.\nAdjustments to sales promotions and incentive accruals are made from time to time as actual usage becomes known in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to generate consumer demand based on market conditions as of the balance sheet date. As of October 31, 2023, we had recorded an accrual for sales promotion and incentive programs of $163.0 million within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe that our accrual for sales promotion and incentive programs is adequate as of October 31, 2023 and historically has been adequate; however, due to the inherent uncertainty in the accrual estimation process,\nactual results may differ from these estimates if competitive factors dictate the need to enhance or modify sales promotion and incentive programs or if customer usage, product mix, or field inventory levels vary from historical trends.\nImpairment\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is initially recognized as a result of the excess of purchase consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. As of October 31, 2023, our goodwill balance was $450.8 million. Goodwill is not amortized, but is assessed for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year unless events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred prior to the annual assessment. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and our 12 reporting units are the same as our 12 operating segments as defined in Note 3, Segment Data, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Nine of our reporting units contained goodwill on their respective balance sheets as of October 31, 2023.\nDuring the preparation of the financial statements for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we concluded that impairment indicators existed for our Intimidator reporting unit goodwill. Based on the resulting impairment assessment performed, we recorded an impairment charge of $133.3 million related to goodwill of the Intimidator reporting unit in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. For additional information regarding the impairment charge, refer to refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, consistent with prior fiscal years, we performed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment assessment, which is a one-step process. In performing the quantitative analysis, we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to its fair value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Based on the fourth quarter annual quantitative goodwill impairment analysis, we determined there was no impairment of goodwill for any of our reporting units as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value, including goodwill. Further, excluding Intimidator, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value, including goodwill, in excess of 100 percent. Given the proximity of our annual impairment analysis to the third quarter analysis which resulted in Impairment for the Intimidator reporting unit goodwill, we would not expect significant excess of fair value over carrying value. The marginal positive excess is indicative of improved performance and a favorable business outlook due to management actions to prioritize and allocate sufficient resources to the Intimidator business, as well as accelerated release of new product offerings which will have a favorable impact to results in fiscal 2024 and beyond.\nThe fair value of each reporting unit under the quantitative goodwill impairment test was determined using a discounted cash flow model under the income approach which requires the use of significant judgment regarding the selection of various inputs and assumptions, including projected operating results and growth rates from the company's projection process, applicable tax rates, estimated capital expenditures and depreciation, estimated changes in working capital, terminal growth rates applied to projected operating results in the terminal period, and a weighted-average cost of capital (\"WACC\") rate. Actual future results may differ significantly from the assumptions used in our valuations resulting in future impairment losses and such losses could be material. As such estimates are sensitive to changes in the underlying inputs and assumptions, we performed sensitivity analyses to address this risk. Excluding Intimidator, the WACC rate could be increased by over 500 basis points with no impairment indicated for any of our reporting units. Excluding Intimidator, the terminal growth rate could be decreased by 300 basis points with no impairment indicated for any of our reporting units.\nThese inputs and assumptions, which are independently determined and vary for each reporting unit, are based on historical experience, our projections of future operating results and contemplate current and future business, industry, and economic conditions, as well as relevant observable market inputs and consideration of risk regarding future performance for purposes of determining the WACC and terminal growth rates. The WACC rate selected is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting unit and in our projected operating results and is calculated based on weighted average returns on debt and equity from guideline public companies. Therefore, changes in the market that are beyond our control and that impact our guideline public companies may have an adverse effect on our future calculations of the estimated fair values of our reporting units. Terminal growth rates are generally determined based on economic and industry growth expectations, while also considering the lifecycle stage of each respective reporting unit. Where available, and as appropriate, comparable EBITDA and revenue multiples are derived from the market prices of stocks of guideline public companies and are used to assist in developing an estimated business enterprise value of our reporting units under the market approach to corroborate our determination of the estimated fair values of our reporting units under the income approach. Identifying appropriate guideline public companies for purposes of computing estimated market multiples and selecting an appropriate WACC rate is subjective. We select guideline public companies that are engaged in the same or similar lines of business and that have reasonably similar qualitative factors as our reporting units, while also considering relevant quantitative factors such as profitability and market\ncapitalization, where applicable. As a final corroboratory step, we reconcile the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units resulting from the income approach to our company's market capitalization.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recognized at their estimated fair values as a result of a business combination or asset acquisition. As of October 31, 2023, our indefinite-lived intangible asset balances, which consist of certain trade names, were $271.5 million. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are assessed for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year unless events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred prior to the annual assessment. We assess indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the individual indefinite-lived intangible asset or asset group level, as appropriate.\nDuring the preparation of the financial statements for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we concluded that impairment indicators existed for our indefinite-lived Spartan trade name intangible asset. Based on the resulting impairment assessment performed, we recorded an impairment charge of $18.0 million related to the indefinite-lived Spartan trade name intangible asset in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. For additional information regarding the impairment charge, refer to refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, consistent with prior fiscal years, we performed our annual quantitative impairment assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the carrying amounts of each respective asset, or asset group, to its estimated fair value. If the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, or asset group, is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. Based on our fourth quarter quantitative impairment analysis, we determined that our indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired as the estimated fair value of each of our indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded its carrying value. Further, excluding the Intimidator Spartan trade name, the fair value of each of our indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded its carrying value in excess of 20 percent. Given the proximity of our annual impairment analysis to the third quarter analysis which resulted in Impairment for the Intimidator Spartan trade name, we would not expect significant excess of fair value over carrying value. The marginal positive excess is indicative of improved performance and a favorable business outlook due to management actions to prioritize and allocate sufficient resources to the Intimidator business, as well as accelerate the release of new product offerings which will have a favorable impact to results in fiscal 2024 and beyond.\nFair value was determined using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach which requires the use of significant judgment regarding the selection of various inputs and assumptions, including projected revenues from the company's projection process, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if the company did not own the intangible asset, terminal growth rates applied to projected revenues, applicable tax rates, and a discount rate. These inputs and assumptions contemplate business, industry, and overall economic conditions, as well as relevant market data for royalty rates of similar intangible assets. Actual future results may differ significantly from the assumptions used in our valuations resulting in future impairment losses and such losses could be material. As such estimates are sensitive to changes in the underlying inputs and assumptions, we performed sensitivity analyses to address this risk. Excluding the Intimidator Spartan trade name, the discount rate could be increased by 170 basis points with no impairment indicated for any of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. Excluding the Intimidator Spartan trade name, the royalty rate could be decreased by 40 basis points with no impairment indicated for any of our indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nDetermining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, or asset groups, requires considerable judgment and such estimates are sensitive to changes in the underlying inputs and assumptions. As a result, there can be no assurance that the inputs and assumptions made for purposes of our annual impairment assessments will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Certain events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected may negatively affect the underlying key inputs and assumptions and ultimately affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Such events or circumstances could include a decrease in expected future operating results and the related cash flows; adverse economic, market, and industry conditions, including unfavorable impacts on our guideline public companies used in determining our WACC rate and the business enterprise value of our reporting units under the market approach; prolonged periods of unfavorable weather conditions; changes in regulatory conditions impacting our products and industries; a continued volatile supply chain environment and/or additional increases in the costs of commodities, component parts, and labor; lack of customer acceptance of new or innovative technologies; increased competition; and other factors. While our annual impairment assessment performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 supported the carrying amount of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may be required to re-evaluate the carrying amount in future periods utilizing different inputs and assumptions that reflect the then current market conditions and expectations regarding our operating performance, which may result in a future impairment that could be material.\nProduct Warranty Guarantees\nOur products are warranted to provide assurance that the product will function as expected and to ensure customer confidence in design, workmanship, and overall quality. Warranty coverage on our products is generally provided for specified periods of time and on select products' hours of usage, and generally covers parts, labor, and other expenses for non-maintenance repairs. Warranty coverage generally does not cover operator abuse or improper use. In addition to the standard warranties offered on our products, we also sell separately priced extended warranty coverage on select products for a prescribed period after the original warranty period expires.\nAt the time of sale, we recognize expense and record a warranty accrual by product line for estimated costs in connection with projected future warranty claims. Our estimate of the cost of future warranty claims is based primarily on the estimated number of products under warranty, historical average costs incurred to service warranty claims, the trend in the historical ratio of warranty claims to sales, and the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim. If applicable, historical claims experience may be adjusted for known product design improvements or for the impact of unusual product quality issues. We periodically assess the adequacy of our warranty accruals based on changes in our estimates and assumptions and record any necessary adjustments if the cost of actual claim experience differs from our estimate and indicates that adjustments to our warranty accrual are necessary. Factors that could have an impact on actual future claims and our warranty accrual include, but are not limited to, items such as performance of new products; product failure rates; factors impacting product usage, such as weather; changes in sales volumes and shifts in product mix; manufacturing quality and product design issues, including significant manufacturing or design defects not discovered until after the product is delivered to customers; the extent of customers affected by the product failure; higher or lower than expected service and component part costs to satisfactorily address the repair, and upon rare occasion, changes to the warranty coverage periods. Additionally, from time to time, we also establish warranty accruals for our estimate of the costs necessary to settle major rework campaigns on a product-specific basis during the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the major rework campaign become known and when the costs to satisfactorily address the situation are both probable and estimable. The warranty accrual for the cost of a major rework campaign is primarily based on an estimate of the cost to repair each affected unit and the number of affected units expected to be repaired.\nWe believe that our analysis of historical warranty claim trends and knowledge of potential manufacturing and/or product design improvements or issues provide sufficient information to establish a reasonable estimate for the cost of future warranty claims at the time of sale and our warranty accruals as of the date of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe that our $143.9 million warranty accrual as of October 31, 2023 is adequate and historically has been adequate; however, due to the inherent uncertainty in the accrual estimation process, including projecting future warranty claims, costs associated with servicing future warranty claims, and unexpected major rework campaigns that may arise in the future, our actual warranty costs incurred may differ from our warranty accrual estimate. An unexpected increase in warranty claims and/or in the costs associated with servicing those claims would result in an increase in our warranty accruals and a decrease in our net earnings.\nInventory Valuation\nApproximately half of our inventories are valued at the lower of the cost of inventory or net realizable value, with cost determined by either the first-in, first-out or average cost method. Other inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined under the last-in, first-out method. As needed, we record an inventory valuation adjustment for excess, slow moving, and obsolete inventory that is equal to the excess of the cost of the inventory over the estimated net realizable value or market value for the inventory depending on inventory costing method. The inventory valuation adjustment to net realizable value or market value establishes a new cost basis of the inventory that cannot be subsequently reversed. Such inventory valuation adjustments for excess, obsolete, and slow moving inventory are not reduced or removed until the product is sold or disposed of.\nIn developing inventory valuation adjustments for excess, slow moving, and obsolete inventory, we are required to use judgment and make estimates of future sales demand and production requirements compared with current inventory levels. Our estimate of projected sales demand and production requirements is primarily based on actual orders received, historical demand, technological and product life cycle changes, product pricing, economic trends, and competitive factors, such as market and pricing trends for similar products. Although we believe our inventory valuation reserve for excess, slow-moving, and obsolete inventory is adequate at $43.9 million as of October 31, 2023, projecting sales demand and production requirements involves significant management judgment regarding future events. Future events that could significantly influence our judgments and related estimates include general economic conditions within the specific markets in which we operate, changes in demand for our products and customer preference, price fluctuations, and actions of our competitors, including the introduction of new products, technological advances, and pricing changes. Projected sales demand and production requirements can also be affected by the significant redesign of our existing products or the replacement of an existing product by an entirely new generation of product. It is possible that an unfavorable adjustment to our inventory valuation reserve for excess, slow moving, and obsolete inventory may be required in the future if there is a change in any of the aforementioned factors that adversely\nimpacts our estimates of future demand for our products and we do not modify our purchases or production schedule accordingly.\nBusiness Combinations\nWhen applicable, we account for the acquisition of a business in accordance with the accounting standards codification guidance for business combinations, whereby the total consideration transferred is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to non-controlling interests, when applicable, based on their respective estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination.\nAssigning estimated fair values to the net assets acquired requires the use of significant estimates, judgments, inputs, and assumptions regarding the fair value of intangible assets that are separately identifiable from goodwill, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment. While the ultimate responsibility for determining estimated fair values of the acquired net assets resides with management, for material acquisitions we may retain the services of certified valuation specialists to assist with assigning estimated fair values to certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including intangible assets that are separately identifiable from goodwill, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment. Estimated fair values of acquired intangible assets that are separately identifiable from goodwill, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment are generally based on available historical information, future expectations, available market data, and assumptions determined to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain with respect to future events, including economic conditions, competition, technological obsolescence, the useful life of the acquired assets, and other factors. These significant estimates, judgments, inputs, and assumptions include, when applicable, the selection of an appropriate valuation method depending on the nature of the respective asset, such as the income approach, the market or sales comparison approach, or the cost approach; estimating future cash flows based on projected revenues and/or margins that we expect to generate subsequent to the acquisition; applying an appropriate discount rate to estimate the present value of those projected cash flows we expect to generate; selecting an appropriate terminal growth rate and/or royalty rate or estimating a customer attrition or technological obsolescence factor where necessary and appropriate given the nature of the respective asset; assigning an appropriate contributory asset charge where needed; determining an appropriate useful life and the related depreciation or amortization method for the respective asset; and assessing the accuracy and completeness of other historical financial metrics of the acquiree used as standalone inputs or as the basis for determining estimated projected inputs such as margins, customer attrition, and costs to hold and sell product.\nIn determining the estimated fair value of intangible assets that are separately identifiable from goodwill, we typically utilize the income approach, which discounts the projected future cash flows using a discount rate that appropriately reflects the risks associated with the projected cash flows. Generally, we estimate the fair value of acquired trade names using the relief from royalty method under the income approach, which is based on the hypothetical royalty stream that would be received if we were to license the acquired trade name. For most other acquired intangible assets, we estimate fair value using the excess earnings method under the income approach, which is typically applied when cash flows are not directly generated by the asset, but rather, by an operating group that includes the particular asset. In certain instances, particularly in relation to developed technology or patents, we may utilize the cost approach depending on the nature of the respective intangible asset and the recency of the development or procurement of such technology. The useful lives and amortization methods for the acquired intangible assets that are separately identifiable from goodwill are generally determined based on the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the acquired intangible assets and the nature of the use of the respective acquired intangible asset, adjusted as appropriate for entity-specific factors including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, and/or other factors such as customer attrition rates and product or order lifecycles that may limit the useful life of the respective acquired intangible asset. In determining the estimated fair value of acquired inventory, we typically utilize the cost approach for raw materials and the sales comparison approach for work in process, finished goods, and service parts. In determining the estimated fair value of acquired property, plant, and equipment, we typically utilize the sales comparison approach or the cost approach depending on the nature of the respective asset and the recency of the construction or procurement of such asset.\nWe may refine the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if necessary, over a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition by taking into consideration new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known as of the date of acquisition, would have affected the estimated fair values ascribed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the estimated useful life and depreciation or amortization method of each asset, can materially impact the net earnings of the periods subsequent to an acquisition through depreciation and amortization, and in certain instances through impairment charges, if the asset becomes impaired in the future. During the measurement period, any purchase price allocation changes that impact the carrying value of goodwill will affect any measurement of goodwill impairment taken during the measurement period, if applicable. If necessary, purchase price allocation revisions that occur outside of the measurement period are recorded within cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expense within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings depending on the nature of the adjustment.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Related Data, in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the section entitled \"New Accounting Pronouncements.\" ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. We are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity costs. We are also exposed to equity market risk pertaining to the trading price of our common stock. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. See further discussion on these market risks below.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such as sales to third-party customers, sales and loans to wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries, costs associated with foreign plant operations, and purchases from suppliers. Our primary foreign currency exchange rate exposures are with the Euro, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, the British pound, the Mexican peso, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi, and the Romanian new leu against the U.S. dollar, as well as the Romanian new leu against the Euro. Because our products are manufactured or sourced primarily from the U.S. and Mexico, a stronger U.S. dollar and Mexican peso generally have a negative impact on our results from operations, while a weaker U.S. dollar and Mexican peso generally have a positive effect.\nTo reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into various derivative instruments to hedge against such risk, authorized under a company policy that places controls on these hedging activities, with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions. Decisions on whether to use such derivative instruments are primarily based on the amount of exposure to the currency involved and an assessment of the near-term market value for each currency. Our worldwide foreign currency exchange rate exposures are reviewed monthly. The gains and losses on our derivative instruments offset the changes in values of the related underlying exposures. Therefore, changes in the values of our derivative instruments are highly correlated with changes in the market values of underlying hedged items both at inception and over the life of the derivative instrument. For additional information regarding our derivative instruments, refer to Note 13, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe foreign currency exchange contracts in the table below have maturity dates in fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2026. All items are non-trading and stated in U.S. dollars. As of October 31, 2023, the average contracted rate, notional amount, fair value, and the gain at fair value of outstanding derivative instruments were as follows (dollars in millions, except average contracted rate):\nAverage Contracted Rate Notional Amount Fair Value Gain at Fair Value\nBuy U.S. dollar/Sell Australian dollar 0.6796 $ 105.6 $ 112.2 $ 6.6\nBuy U.S. dollar/Sell Canadian dollar 1.3317 42.4 43.9 1.5\nBuy U.S. dollar/Sell Euro 1.1051 146.6 150.4 3.8\nBuy U.S. dollar/Sell British pound 1.2352 43.5 44.1 0.6\nBuy Mexican peso/Sell U.S. dollar 20.9278 $ 42.6 $ 46.8 $ 4.2\nOur net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into U.S. dollars is not hedged. Any changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected as a foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and would not impact net earnings.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur interest rate risk relates primarily to fluctuations in variable interest rates on our revolving credit facility and term loan credit agreements, as well as the potential increase in the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt resulting from a potential decrease in interest rates. We generally do not use interest rate swaps to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. We have no earnings or cash flow exposure due to interest rate risks on our fixed-rate long-term debt obligations.\nOur indebtedness as of October 31, 2023 included $524.2 million of gross fixed rate debt that is not subject to variable interest rate fluctuations and $510.0 million of gross variable rate debt under our term loan credit agreements and revolving credit\nfacility. As of October 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of gross long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $478.2 million compared to its carrying amount of $524.2 million. Interest rate risk for fixed-rate, long-term debt is estimated as the potential increase in the fair value of gross fixed rate debt, resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in interest rates, and amounts to $20.3 million. The estimated fair value of gross fixed rate debt is estimated by discounting the projected cash flows of our gross fixed rate debt using the current interest rate that could be obtained for similar amounts of debt and a similar financing term.\nCommodity Cost Risk\nMost of the commodities, components, parts, and accessories used in our manufacturing process and end-products, or to be sold as standalone end-products, are exposed to commodity cost changes. These changes may be affected by several factors, including, for example, demand; inflation; deflation; changing prices; foreign currency fluctuations; tariffs; duties; trade regulatory actions; industry actions; the inability of suppliers to absorb incremental costs related to inefficiencies, continue operations or otherwise remain in business; financial difficulties; changes to international trade policies, agreements, and/or regulation; and competitor activity, including antidumping and countervailing duties on certain products imported from foreign countries, such as certain engines imported into the U.S. from China.\nOur primary cost exposures for commodities, components, parts, and accessories used in our products are with steel, aluminum, petroleum and natural gas-based resins, linerboard, copper, lead, rubber, engines, transmissions, transaxles, hydraulics, electrification components, and others. Our largest spend categories for commodities, components, parts, and accessories are generally steel, engines, hydraulic components, transmissions, resin, aluminum, and electrification components, all of which we purchase from several suppliers around the world. We generally purchase commodities, components, parts, and accessories based upon market prices that are established with suppliers as part of the purchase process and generally attempt to obtain firm pricing from most of our suppliers for volumes consistent with planned production and estimates of wholesale and retail demand for our products.\nIn any given period, we strategically attempt to mitigate potential unfavorable impact as a result of changes to the cost of commodities, components, parts, and accessories that affect our product lines through our productivity initiatives; however, our productivity initiatives may not be as effective as anticipated depending on macroeconomic cost trends for commodities, components, parts, and accessories costs and/or other factors. Our productivity initiatives include, but are not limited to, collaborating with suppliers, reviewing alternative sourcing options, substituting materials, SKU rationalization, utilizing Lean methods, engaging in internal cost reduction efforts, and utilizing tariff exclusions and duty drawback mechanisms, all as appropriate. When appropriate, we may also increase prices on some of our products to offset changes in the cost of commodities, components, parts, and accessories. To the extent that commodity and component costs increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers, or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices, and/or our productivity initiatives and/or product price increases are less effective than anticipated and/or do not fully offset cost increases, we may experience a decline in our gross margins.\nEquity Market Risk\nVolatility in the trading price of our common stock impacts the compensation costs associated with our stock-based compensation awards. Additionally, when applicable, declines in the trading price of our common stock can adversely impact our reconciliation of our market capitalization to the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units as a component of our goodwill impairment analysis and can also represent an interim period impairment indicator requiring the need to quantitatively assess goodwill for impairment during an interim period, which could result in impairment charges. Refer to Note 9, Stock-Based Compensation, and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Related Data, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our stock-based compensation awards and our goodwill impairment analysis, respectively. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for The Toro Company and its subsidiaries. This system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nThe company's system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements, and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. In addition, projection of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement, with the participation of the company's Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer and Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023. In making this evaluation, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management concluded that the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2023. The company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\n/s/ Richard M. Olson\nChairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer\n/s/ Angela C. Drake\nVice President, Chief Financial Officer\nDecember 20, 2023\nFurther discussion of the company's internal controls and procedures is included in Part II, Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nThe Toro Company:\nOpinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Toro Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAccrued sales promotions and incentives\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, at the time of sale, the Company records an estimate for sales promotion and incentive costs, a portion of which relates to rebate programs. As of October 31, 2023, the Company recorded an accrual of $163.0 million for sales promotions and incentives. The Companys estimates for sales promotion and incentive costs are primarily based on the terms of the sales arrangements and sales promotion and incentive programs with customers, historical payment and rebate claims experience, field inventory levels, quantity or mix of products purchased, types of programs offered, and expectations for the acceptance of sales promotion and incentive programs offered in the future or changes in other relevant trends.\nWe identified the evaluation of the accrued sales promotions and incentives as a critical audit matter. To evaluate the Companys expectations for changes in other relevant trends that were used to develop the estimate, a high degree of auditor judgment was required. Historical experience was an input used to develop expectations for changes in other relevant trends. Changes in other relevant trends could have an impact to the accrual for sales promotions and incentives.\nThe following are the primary procedures performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Companys sales promotions and incentives process. This included controls related to the evaluation of the input described above. We evaluated the Companys ability to estimate the sales promotions and incentives accruals by comparing the prior years accrual with subsequent payments. We developed an expectation of the Companys accrual considering historical experience and current year field inventory levels. We tested sales promotions and incentives paid throughout the year by tracing a sample of payments to underlying documentation supporting the program terms to evaluate whether there have been any changes in other relevant trends. Additionally, we tested sales promotions and incentives paid subsequent to the balance sheet date by tracing a sample of payments to underlying documentation supporting the program terms to evaluate the accrual estimate.\nFair value of the Intimidator Group reporting unit and indefinite-lived Spartan trade name intangible asset\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $18.0 million related to the indefinite-lived Spartan trade name intangible asset reported under the Professional segment. Further, during the same period, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $133.3 million related to goodwill of the Intimidator reporting unit also reported under the Professional segment. In assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model. In assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company estimates the fair value of the intangible assets using the relief-from-royalty method. Impairment charges are recorded for any goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets with carrying values in excess of their respective estimated fair values.\nWe identified the evaluation of the fair values of the Intimidator reporting unit and indefinite-lived Spartan trade name intangible asset as a critical audit matter. Testing certain assumptions used to determine the fair values, specifically, projected revenue growth rates, projected earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margins, and the discount rate, involved a high degree of subjectivity. Specifically, there was limited observable market information for the projected revenue growth rates and EBIT margins and evaluation of the discount rate assumption required valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge. In addition, the fair values of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived trade name intangible asset were challenging to evaluate due to their sensitivity to changes in these assumptions.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Companys determination of the fair value of the Intimidator reporting unit and indefinite-lived Spartan trade name intangible asset. This included certain controls related to the development of the relevant assumptions as listed above. We performed sensitivity analyses over the relevant assumptions to assess the impact of changes in those assumptions on the Companys determination of the projected values of the Intimidator reporting unit and indefinite-lived Spartan trade name intangible asset. We evaluated the Companys projected revenue growth rates and projected EBIT margins by comparing them to historical actual results of the Company, considering market and industry conditions. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\nevaluating the Companys discount rate by comparing it against a discount rate range that was independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities;

The company sells its products worldwide through a network of distributors, dealers, mass retailers, hardware retailers, equipment rental centers, and home centers, as well as online and direct to end-users. The company strives to provide innovative, well-built, and dependable products supported by an extensive service network.\nThe following are the company's significant accounting policies in addition to those included in the other Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within this Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted (\"GAAP\") in the United States (\"U.S.\") and include the accounts of the company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. In the opinion of management, the Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting primarily of recurring accruals, considered necessary for the fair presentation of the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented.\nThe company's businesses are organized, managed, and internally grouped into segments based on similarities in products and services. The company classifies its operations into two reportable business segments: Professional and Residential. The company's remaining activities are presented as \"Other\" due to their insignificance. For additional information regarding the company's reportable business segments refer to Note 3, Segment Data.\nThe company uses the equity method to account for equity investments in unconsolidated entities over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. The company's share of the net earnings or losses of these equity method investments are recorded within other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Equity investments in unconsolidated entities that the company does not control and for which it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are recorded at cost, less impairment, as applicable, within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated from the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAccounting Estimates\nIn preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management must make decisions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and the related disclosures, including disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. Estimates are used in determining, among other items, sales promotion and incentive accruals; incentive compensation accruals; income tax accruals; inventory valuation; warranty accruals; allowance for expected credit losses; pension accruals; self-insurance accruals; legal accruals; right-of-use assets and lease liabilities; useful lives for tangible and finite-lived intangible assets; future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and other long-lived assets; and valuations of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination or asset acquisition, when applicable. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgments at the time they are made and are generally derived from management's understanding and analysis of the relevant and current circumstances, historical experience, and actuarial and other independent external third-party specialist valuations, when applicable. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, including the current economic environment and other relevant factors, as applicable. Management adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual amounts could differ significantly from those estimated at the time the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared. Changes in those estimates will be reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods.\nBusiness Combinations and Asset Acquisitions\nWhen applicable, the company accounts for the acquisition of a business in accordance with the accounting standards codification (\"ASC\") guidance for business combinations, whereby the total purchase consideration transferred is allocated to\nthe assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to non-controlling interests, when applicable, based on their respective estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination.\nAssigning estimated fair values to the net assets acquired requires the use of significant estimates, judgments, inputs, and assumptions regarding the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are generally based on available historical information, independent valuations or appraisals, future expectations, and assumptions determined to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain with respect to future events, including economic conditions, competition, the useful life of the acquired assets, and other factors. The company may refine the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if necessary, over a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition by taking into consideration new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known at the date of acquisition, would have affected the estimated fair values ascribed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the estimated useful life and depreciation or amortization method of each asset, can materially impact the net earnings of the periods subsequent to the acquisition through depreciation and amortization, and in certain instances through impairment charges, if the asset becomes impaired in the future. During the measurement period, any purchase price allocation changes that impact the carrying value of goodwill would also affect the amount of goodwill impairment taken, if applicable. If necessary, purchase price allocation revisions that occur outside of the measurement period are recorded within cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expense within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings depending on the nature of the adjustment.\nWhen an acquisition does not meet the definition of a business combination because either: (i) substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset, or group of similar identified assets, or (ii) the acquired entity does not have an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, the company accounts for the acquisition as an asset acquisition. In an asset acquisition, goodwill is not recognized, but rather, any excess purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the identifiable net assets as of the acquisition date and any direct acquisition-related transaction costs are capitalized as part of the purchase consideration.\nRefer to Note 2, Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions, for additional information regarding the company's accounting for recent business combinations and asset acquisitions.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, cash and cash equivalents held by the company's foreign subsidiaries were $91.1 million and $93.4 million, respectively.\nReceivables, Net\nReceivables are recorded at original carrying amount less an estimated allowance for expected credit losses. The allowance for expected credit losses is based on the company's assessment of losses that will result from its customers inability or unwillingness to pay amounts owed to the company. The allowance for expected credit losses is estimated using a combination of factors, including the age of receivable balances and historical credit loss experience, supplemented by the company's knowledge of customer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable projections of future events and economic conditions, when applicable. Receivables are written-off against the allowance for expected credit losses when all collection efforts have been exhausted.\nThe company's financial exposure related to the collection of accounts receivable is reduced due to its inventory financing arrangements, as further discussed in Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies.\nFor receivables not serviced through inventory financing agreements, the company provides financing in the form of open account terms in the normal course of business and performs on-going credit evaluations of customers.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments, which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of accounts receivable and derivative instruments. Accounts receivable balances are generally concentrated in the Professional and Residential business segments. The credit risk associated with these business segments is limited because of the large number of customers in the company's customer base and their geographic dispersion. The credit risk associated with the company's derivative instruments is limited as the company enters into derivative instruments with multiple counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions.\nInventories, Net\nThe company uses a combination of inventory valuation methods. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined by the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") and average cost methods for approximately 58.5 percent and 50.8 percent of total net inventories as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Other inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined under the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method. During fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, LIFO layers were not materially reduced. As needed, the company records an inventory valuation adjustment for excess, slow-moving, and obsolete inventory that is equal to the excess of the cost of the inventory over the estimated net realizable value or market value for the inventory depending on the inventory costing method. Such inventory valuation adjustment is based on a review and comparison of current inventory levels to planned production, as well as planned and historical sales of the inventory. The inventory valuation adjustment to net realizable value or market value establishes a new cost basis of the inventory that cannot be subsequently reversed. Such inventory valuation adjustments for excess, obsolete, and slow moving inventory are not reduced or removed until the product is sold or disposed of. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, the company's inventory valuation adjustment for excess, slow-moving, and obsolete inventory was $43.9 million and $38.7 million, respectively.\nInventories, net were as follows (dollars in millions):\nOctober 31 2023 2022\nRaw materials and work in process $ 400.3 $ 482.9\nFinished goods and service parts 844.2 738.1\nTotal FIFO value 1,244.5 1,221.0\nLess: adjustment to LIFO value 156.7 169.9\nTotal inventories, net $ 1,087.8 $ 1,051.1\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nProperty, plant and equipment assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The company generally accounts for depreciation of property, plant and equipment utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings and leasehold improvements are generally depreciated over 10 to 40 years, machinery and equipment are generally depreciated over three to 15 years, tooling is generally depreciated over three to five years, and computer hardware and software and website development costs are generally depreciated over two to five years. Expenditures for major renewals and improvements, which substantially increase the useful lives of existing assets, are capitalized. Costs associated with general maintenance and repairs are expenses as incurred within cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings depending on the nature and use of the related asset. Interest is capitalized during the construction period for significant capital projects. During the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the company capitalized $4.2 million, $2.5 million, and $0.8 million of interest, respectively.\nProperty, plant and equipment, net was as follows (dollars in millions):\nOctober 31 2023 2022\nLand and land improvements $ 69.0 $ 59.6\nBuildings and leasehold improvements 355.8 324.3\nMachinery and equipment 624.6 557.6\nTooling 260.4 225.9\nComputer hardware and software 98.0 104.7\nConstruction in process 133.2 144.4\nProperty, plant and equipment, gross 1,541.0 1,416.5\nLess: accumulated depreciation 899.3 844.8\nProperty, plant and equipment, net $ 641.7 $ 571.7\nDuring fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, the company recorded depreciation expense of $83.5 million, $74.9 million, and $75.5 million, respectively.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is initially recognized as a result of the excess of purchase consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recognized at their estimated fair values as a result of a business combination or asset acquisition. Goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit based upon the expected benefit of the synergies of the acquisition. Goodwill and certain trade names, which are considered to have indefinite lives, are not amortized; however, the company reviews them for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate that impairment may have occurred prior to the annual assessment. The company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and tests indefinite-lived\nintangible assets for impairment at the individual indefinite-lived intangible asset or asset group level, as appropriate. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the company recorded an impairment charge of $18.0 million related to the indefinite-lived Spartan trade name intangible asset reported under the Professional segment. Further, during the same period, the company recorded an impairment charge of $133.3 million related to goodwill of the Intimidator reporting unit also reported under the Professional segment, Refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further information.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test. In performing the annual goodwill impairment test, the company first reviewed its reporting units and determined that it has twelve reporting units, which are the same as its twelve operating segments as defined in Note 3, Segment Data. Nine reporting units contained goodwill on their respective balance sheets as of October 31, 2023. Next, the company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and move directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. In performing the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis, the company compared the carrying value of each reporting unit, including goodwill, to its respective fair value. The carrying value of each reporting unit was determined based on the amount of equity required for the reporting unit's activities, considering the specific assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The company did not assign corporate assets and liabilities that do not relate to the operations of the reporting unit, or are not considered in determining the fair value of the reporting unit, to the reporting units. The company's estimate of the respective fair values of its reporting units was determined based on a discounted cash flow model under the income approach, which utilized various inputs and assumptions, including projected operating results and growth rates from the company's projection process, applicable tax rates, estimated capital expenditures and depreciation, estimated changes in working capital, terminal growth rates applied to projected operating results in the terminal period, and a weighted-average cost of capital rate. Where available, and as appropriate, comparable market multiples and the company's market capitalization were also utilized to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow models under the income approach. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Based on the quantitative annual goodwill impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the company determined there was no impairment of goodwill for any of its reporting units. Further, no impairment of goodwill was recorded during fiscal 2022 and 2021.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the company also performed a quantitative impairment analysis for its indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of certain trade names. The company's estimate of the fair values of its trade names are based on the relief from royalty method under the income approach and utilizes various inputs and assumptions, including projected revenues from the company's projection process, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if the company did not own the intangible asset, terminal growth rates applied to projected revenues, applicable tax rates, and a discount rate. If the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, or asset group, is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. Based on this quantitative impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the company concluded its indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired. Further, the company concluded its indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired during fiscal 2022 and 2021 based on the same quantitative impairment analysis performed in each respective prior fiscal year.\nOther Long-Lived Assets\nOther long-lived assets primarily consist of property, plant and equipment; right-of-use assets associated with operating lease agreements; capitalized implementation costs for hosted cloud-computing arrangements; finite-lived intangible assets; and other assets, as applicable. The company's finite-lived intangible assets are identifiable assets that were acquired as a result of business combinations or asset acquisitions and primarily consist of customer relationships and lists, developed technology, patents, trade names, non-compete agreements, and order backlog and are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, which typically range from several months to 20 years depending on the nature of the finite-lived intangible asset.\nThe company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset, or asset group, may not be recoverable. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other asset groups. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation or disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is generally measured using a discounted cash flow model or independent appraisals, as appropriate. The company did not record an impairment loss for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 as the company's long-lived assets were determined to not be at risk for impairment as no events or changes in circumstances were identified that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset, or asset group, may not be recoverable.\nFor other long-lived assets to be abandoned, the company tests for potential impairment. If the company commits to a plan to abandon or dispose of an other long-lived asset, or asset group, before the end of its previously estimated useful life, depreciation or amortization expense is recognized over the revised estimated useful life.\nLeases\nThe company enters into contracts that are, or contain, operating lease agreements that convey the company's right to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from, an identified asset for a defined period of time in exchange for consideration. The lease term begins and is determined upon lease commencement, which is the point in time when the company takes possession of the identified asset, and includes all non-cancelable periods.\nLease liabilities represent the company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease agreement. The company accounts for operating lease liabilities at lease commencement and on an ongoing basis as the present value of the minimum remaining lease payments under the respective lease term. Lease payments are determined at lease commencement and represent fixed lease payments as defined within the respective lease agreement or, in the case of certain lease agreements, variable lease payments that are measured as of the lease commencement date based on the prevailing index or market rate. Future adjustments to variable lease payments are defined and scheduled within the respective lease agreement and are determined based upon the prevailing market or index rate at the time of the adjustment relative to the market or index rate determined at lease commencement. Certain other lease agreements contain variable lease payments that are determined based upon actual utilization of the identified asset. Such future adjustments to variable lease payments and variable lease payments based upon actual utilization of the identified asset are not included within the determination of lease payments at commencement but rather, are recorded as variable lease expense in the period in which the variable lease cost is incurred. The company has operating leases with both lease components and non-lease components. For purposes of determining lease payments, the company accounts for lease components separately from non-lease components based on the relative market value of each component. Non-lease components typically consist of common area maintenance, utilities, and/or other repairs and maintenance services. The costs related to non-lease components are not included within the determination of lease payments at commencement. Minimum remaining lease payments are discounted to present value based on the rate implicit in the operating lease agreement or the estimated incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement if the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. Minimum remaining lease payments are generally discounted to present value based the estimated incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement as the rate implicit in the lease is generally not readily determinable.\nRight-of-use assets represent the company's right to use an underlying asset throughout the lease term and are measured as the amount of the corresponding operating lease liability for the respective operating lease agreement, adjusted for prepaid or accrued lease payments, the remaining balance of any lease incentives received, unamortized initial direct costs, and impairment of the operating lease right-of-use asset, as applicable.\nLease expense for the company's operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded within either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings depending on the nature and use of the identified asset underlying the respective operating lease arrangement. The company does not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, but does recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis, for short-term operating leases which have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset.\nAccounts Payable\nThe company has a supply chain finance service agreement with a third-party financial institution to provide a web-based platform that facilitates the ability of participating suppliers to finance payment obligations from the company with the third-party financial institution. Participating suppliers may, at their sole discretion, make offers to finance one or more payment obligations of the company prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price to the third-party financial institution. The company's obligations to its suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not affected by suppliers' decisions to finance amounts under this supply chain finance arrangement. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, $99.6 million and $133.7 million, respectively, of the company's outstanding payment obligations were financed by participating suppliers through the third-party financial institution's supply chain finance web-based platform.\nInsurance\nThe company is self-insured for certain losses relating to employee medical, dental, workers' compensation, and certain product liability claims. Specific stop loss coverages are provided for catastrophic claims in order to limit exposure to significant claims. Losses and claims are charged to net earnings when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Self-insured liabilities are based on a number of factors, including historical claims experience, an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, demographic and severity factors, and utilizing valuations provided by independent third-party actuaries, as applicable.\nProduct Warranty Guarantees\nThe companys products are warranted to provide assurance that the product will function as expected and to ensure customer confidence in design, workmanship, and overall quality. Standard warranty coverage is generally provided for specified periods of time and on select products hours of usage, and generally covers parts, labor, and other expenses for non-maintenance repairs. The company also sells separately priced extended warranty coverage on select products for a prescribed period after the original warranty period expires. For additional information on the contract liabilities associated with the company's separately priced extended warranties, refer to Note 4, Revenue.\nAt the time of sale, the company recognizes expense and records an accrual by product line for estimated costs in connection with projected future warranty claims. The company's estimate of the cost of future warranty claims is based primarily on the estimated number of products under warranty, historical average costs incurred to service warranty claims, the trend in the historical ratio of claims to sales, and the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim. The company periodically assesses the adequacy of its warranty accruals based on changes in these factors and records any necessary adjustments if the cost of actual claims experience indicates that adjustments to the company's warranty accrual are necessary. Additionally, from time to time, the company may also establish warranty accruals for its estimate of the costs necessary to settle major rework campaigns on a product-specific basis during the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the major rework campaign become known and when the costs to satisfactorily address the situation are both probable and estimable. The warranty accrual for the cost of a major rework campaign is primarily based on an estimate of the cost to repair each affected unit and the number of affected units expected to be repaired.\nThe changes in accrued warranties were as follows (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended October 31 2023 2022 2021\nBeginning balance $ 134.5 $ 116.8 $ 107.1\nChanges in accrual related to warranties issued during the period1\n90.1 81.5 73.5\nAcquisitions - 5.7 -\nPayments made during the period1\n(84.5) (74.6) (71.3)\nChanges in accrual related to pre-existing warranties1\n3.8 5.1 7.5\nEnding balance $ 143.9 $ 134.5 $ 116.8\n1 Presentation of prior period changes in accrued warranties has been conformed to the current year presentation. There was no impact to the balance of accrued warranties in any period.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nDerivative instruments, consisting primarily of forward currency contracts, are used to hedge most foreign currency transactions, including projected sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies. All derivative instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities. If the derivative instrument is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, changes in the fair values of the spot rate component of outstanding, highly effective cash flow hedging instruments included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in other comprehensive income within accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are subsequently reclassified to net earnings within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings during the same period in which the cash flows of the underlying hedged transaction affect net earnings. Changes in the fair values of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized immediately in net earnings under the mark-to-market approach. Derivatives that are not designated as cash flow hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through other income, net, on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\nThe functional currency of the company's foreign operations is generally the applicable local currency. The functional currency is translated into U.S. dollars using the respective current exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date for balance sheet accounts and the respective weighted-average exchange rate during the fiscal year for revenue and expense accounts. The resulting translation adjustments are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity. Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are included in other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nDebt issuance costs incurred in connection with securing the companys financing arrangements are capitalized and amortized over the term of the respective financing arrangement under the straight-line method as the results obtained are not materially different from those that would result from the use of the effective interest method. Debt issuance costs are generally presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the outstanding borrowings, consistent with debt discounts. However, the company classifies the debt issuance costs related to its $600.0 million five-year senior\nunsecured revolving credit facility (\"revolving credit facility\") within other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, regardless of whether the company has any outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility. Debt issuance costs related to borrowings that are fully extinguished in advance of the maturity date are charged to expense at the time of retirement of the borrowings. Debt issuance costs, net of accumulated amortization, were $3.8 million and $4.8 million as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years that those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided when, in management's judgment, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The company believes it has reflected the necessary deferred tax assets and liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes the future tax deductions will be realized principally through future taxable income, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, and carryback to taxable income in prior years.\nThe company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if it is more likely than not that those positions will be sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50.0 percent likely to be realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The company also records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe company's primary source of revenue is generated through the sale of equipment and irrigation products, as well as rendering of services to its customers. As a result, the company enters into contracts with its customers for the sale of products or rendering of services in the ordinary course of business, which generally occurs at the time the company receives and accepts a purchase or sales order under a sales contract with a customer. The company recognizes revenue when, or as, performance obligations under the terms of a contract with its customer are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of control of product or services at the time a product is shipped, or in the case of certain agreements, when a product is delivered or as services are rendered. Revenue is recognized based on the transaction price, which is measured as the amount of consideration the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring product or rendering services pursuant to the terms of the contract with a customer. The amount of consideration the company receives and the revenue the company recognizes varies as a result of variable consideration. Variable consideration is recorded at the time revenue is recognized as a reduction of the transaction price and typically occurs as a result of certain of the company's sales promotion and incentive programs offered to customers that are determined to represent price concessions, as well as anticipated product returns, when applicable. If a contract contains more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price of the respective promised good or service. The company does not recognize revenue in situations where collectability from the customer is not probable, and defers the recognition of revenue until collection is probable or payment is received and performance obligations are satisfied.\nSales Promotions and Incentives\nAt the time revenue is recognized, the company records a reduction of the transaction price for the variable consideration associated with certain of the company's sales promotions and incentives programs offered to customers that are determined to represent price concessions. The expense of each sales promotion and incentive program is classified as a reduction from gross sales or as a component of selling, general and administrative expense within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings when revenue is recognized, depending on the nature of the program. Generally, the cost of a program is recorded as a reduction from gross sales when revenue is recognized and thus, is considered to be variable consideration, if the expense is determined to represent a price concession because the program either (i) results in an immediate reduction of the transaction price with no anticipated future costs or consideration provided to the customer or (ii) the company anticipates future costs based on historical or expected future business practice for which the company does not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the future consideration provided to the customer under the program. In other circumstances, the anticipated future cost of a program based on historical or expected future business practice is recorded as selling, general and administrative expense because the company receives a distinct good or service in exchange for the future consideration provided to the customer under the program.\nExamples of significant sales promotions and incentive programs that are considered to be variable consideration because the cost of the program is classified as a reduction from gross sales are as follows:\nOff-Invoice Discounts: The company's off-invoice discounts represent an immediate reduction in the selling price of the company's products that is realized at the time of sale with no anticipated future cost or consideration provided to the customer.\nRebate Programs: The company's rebate programs are generally based on claims submitted from either the company's direct customers or end-users of the company's products or are based on purchase or retail sales goals for the company's direct customers of certain quantities or mixes of product during a specified time period, depending upon the program. The amount of the rebate varies based on the specific program and is either a dollar amount or a percentage of the purchase price and can also be based on actual retail price as compared to the company's selling price. Consideration is typically provided to the company's customers for the company's rebate programs after the initial sale of the company's products to the company's direct customers and thus, there is generally an anticipated future cost at the time revenue is recognized based on historical and expected future business practice.\nFinancing Programs: The company's financing programs consist of floor plan financing programs with Red Iron and separate third-party financial institutions and end-user retail financing. Costs incurred for floor plan financing programs represent financing costs associated with programs under which the company shares the expense of financing distributor and dealer inventories through third-party financing arrangements for a specific period of time. This charge represents interest for a pre-established length of time based on a predefined rate from the contract between the company and Red Iron or the separate third-party financial institution to finance distributor and dealer inventory purchase. The floor plan financing costs for distributor and dealer inventories were $114.7 million, $46.3 million, and $20.8 million for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. End-user retail financing is similar to floor planning with the difference being that retail financing programs are offered to end-user customers under which the company, at its discretion, may pay a portion of interest costs on behalf of end-users for financing purchases of the company's equipment.\nExamples of significant sales promotions and incentive programs that are not considered to be variable consideration because the cost of the program is classified as a component of selling, general, and administrative expense are as follows:\nCommissions Paid to Distributors and Dealers: For certain products, the company uses a distribution network of dealers and distributors that purchase and take possession of products for sale to the end customer. The company also has dealers and distributors that act as sales agents for it on certain products using a direct-selling type model. Under this direct-selling type model, the company's network of distributors and dealers facilitates a sale directly to the dealer or end-user customer on its behalf. Commissions to distributors and dealers in these instances represent commission payments to sales agents that are also its customers. In addition, TTC dealers are often paid a commission to set up and deliver riding product purchased at certain mass retail and home centers.\nCooperative Advertising: Cooperative advertising programs are based on advertising costs incurred by distributors and dealers for promoting the company's products. The company supports a portion of those advertising costs in which claims are submitted by the distributor or dealer along with evidence of the advertising material procured/produced and evidence of the cost incurred in the form of third-party invoices or receipts.\nRegardless of classification of the cost of the sales promotion and incentive program within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, the company records an accrual within the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the estimated future expense of certain of its sales promotion and incentive programs for which the company anticipates a future cost based on historical or expected future business practice by using the expected value method and applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under the accounting standards codification guidance for revenue from contracts with customers. Under such approach, the company's determination of variable consideration and the related accrual associated with the estimated expense of certain of the company's sales promotions and incentives programs is primarily based on the terms of the sales arrangements and sales promotion and incentive programs with customers, historical payment and rebate claims experience, field inventory levels, quantity or mix of products purchased, projected sales volumes, types of programs offered, and expectations for the acceptance of sales promotion and incentive programs offered in the future or changes in other relevant trends.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed to manufacture the company's products, as well as compensations costs for manufacturing labor and direct overhead expense necessary to convert direct materials and supplies into finished product. Cost of sales also includes freight costs for the procurement of direct materials and supplies and shipping products to customers; charges associated with inventory valuation adjustments for excess, slow-moving, and obsolete inventory; depreciation and amortization expense on manufacturing-related tangible and intangible assets; operating lease expense related to leased manufacturing assets; cost of services provided; cash discounts on payments to vendors, and other manufacturing-related costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of compensation costs for non-manufacturing labor, occupancy and operating costs of distribution and corporate facilities, warranty expense, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing tangible and intangible assets, operating lease expense related to leased non-manufacturing assets; advertising, marketing, and selling expenses, engineering and research costs, information systems costs, and other miscellaneous administrative costs, such as legal costs for internal and outside services that are expensed as incurred.\nAdvertising Expense\nGeneral advertising costs are expensed in the period incurred. Cooperative advertising represents expenditures for shared advertising costs that the company reimburses to customers and is classified as a component of selling, general and administrative expense within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. These obligations are accrued and expensed when the related revenues are recognized in accordance with the sales promotion and incentive programs established for certain product lines. Advertising costs were $77.6 million, $58.3 million, and $50.5 million for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nEngineering and Research Expense\nThe company's engineering and research costs are expensed as incurred as a component of selling, general and administrative expense within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and are primarily incurred in connection with the development of new products that may have additional applications or represent extensions of existing product lines, improvements or enhancements to existing products, and cost reduction efforts. Costs incurred for engineering and research activities were $173.9 million, $155.6 million, and $141.0 million for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe company's stock-based compensation awards are generally granted to executive officers, other employees, and non-employee members of the company's Board of Directors (\"Board\"), and include unrestricted common stock awards, performance share awards that are contingent on the achievement of performance goals of the company, non-qualified stock options, and restricted stock units. Generally, compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value determined under the Black-Scholes valuation method is recognized for these awards over the vesting period and is classified in selling, general and administrative expense within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For stock options and restricted stock units, expense recognized for other employees not considered executive officers and non-employee Board members is net of estimated forfeitures, which is based on historical forfeiture experience. Stock options granted to executive officers and other employees are subject to accelerated expensing if the option holder meets the retirement definition set forth in the applicable equity and incentive plan document. In that case, the fair value of the options is expensed in the fiscal year of grant because generally, if the option holder is employed as of the end of the fiscal year in which the options are granted, such options will not be forfeited but continue to vest according to their schedule following retirement. For additional information on The Toro Company 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan, refer to Note 9, Stock-Based Compensation.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net primarily consists of the company's proportionate share of income or losses from Red Iron, realized foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses, interest and dividend income, gains or losses recognized on actuarial valuation changes for our pension and post-retirement plans, retail financing revenue, and other miscellaneous income.\nNet Earnings Per Share\nBasic net earnings per share is calculated as net earnings available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year plus the assumed issuance of contingent shares related to performance share awards under the company's equity and incentive plans. Diluted net earnings per share is similar to basic net earnings per share except that the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the assumed issuance of contingent shares is increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding assuming the issuance of all potentially dilutive shares, such as common stock to be issued upon exercise of options, contingently issuable shares, and restricted stock units.\nReconciliations of basic and diluted weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding are as follows (in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended October 31 2023 2022 2021\nBasic\nWeighted-average number of shares of common stock 104.4 104.8 107.3\nAssumed issuance of contingent shares - - -\nWeighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding - Basic 104.4 104.8 107.3\nDiluted\nWeighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding - Basic 104.4 104.8 107.3\nEffect of dilutive securities 0.9 0.8 1.1\nWeighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding - Diluted 105.3 105.6 108.5\nIncremental shares from stock options and restricted stock units are computed under the treasury stock method. Stock option awards to purchase 573,662, 906,121, and 409,851 shares of common stock during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted net earnings per share of common stock because they were anti-dilutive.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance. The update increases the transparency of government assistance including annual disclosure of the types of assistance, an entitys accounting for the assistance, and the effect of the assistance on an entitys financial statements. The amended guidance was adopted for the fiscal 2023 annual period and did not have a material impact on the company's Consolidated Financial Statements or annual disclosures.\nThe company believes that all other recently issued accounting pronouncements from the FASB that the company has not noted above will not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements or do not apply to its operations.\n2 Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions\nBusiness Combinations\nDealer Acquisition\nOn May 9, 2023, during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of, and assumed certain liabilities for, a U.S. based dealer of underground construction equipment. The purchase price of this acquisition was allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of their fair value and no goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets were recorded. The company finalized the purchase accounting for this acquisition during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Additional purchase accounting disclosures have been omitted due to immateriality of this acquisition in relation to the company's consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nIntimidator\nOn January 13, 2022 (\"Intimidator closing date\"), during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company acquired the privately-held Intimidator for net aggregate purchase consideration of $399.8 million (\"the purchase price\"). Intimidator primarily designs, manufactures, markets, and sells a commercial-grade line of zero-turn mowers under the Spartan brand, which are intended to provide innovative turf management solutions to landscape contractors and other customers including homeowners who prefer professional solutions. The acquisition of Intimidator broadened the company's Professional segment and expanded its manufacturing footprint and dealer network.\nIntimidator Purchase Price Allocation\nThe company accounted for the Intimidator acquisition in accordance with the accounting standards codification guidance for business combinations, whereby the purchase price was allocated to the acquired net tangible and intangible assets of Intimidator based on their fair values as of the closing date. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the company completed its valuation of income taxes to finalize the purchase price allocation. The following table summarizes the allocation of the Intimidator purchase price to the fair values assigned to the Intimidator assets acquired and liabilities assumed (dollars in millions):\nJanuary 13, 2022\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1.0\nReceivables 7.0\nInventories 34.6\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 0.5\nProperty, plant and equipment 27.4\nRight-of-use assets 0.3\nGoodwill 163.7\nIndefinite-lived other intangible assets:\nTrade names 99.1\nFinite-lived other intangible assets:\nCustomer-related 80.5\nTrade names 3.3\nBacklog 1.3\nAccounts payable (8.5)\nAccrued liabilities (9.1)\nShort-term lease liabilities (0.1)\nLong-term liabilities (0.2)\nTotal fair value of net assets acquired 400.8\nLess: cash and cash equivalents acquired (1.0)\nTotal purchase price $ 399.8\nThe goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to the expected future cash flows, the value of the workforce, and expected synergies, including customer and dealer growth opportunities, expanding existing product lines, and cost reduction initiatives. Key areas of expected cost synergies include increased purchasing power for commodities, components, parts, and accessories and supply chain consolidation. The goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Intimidator was recognized within the company's Professional segment. The acquisition was considered an asset purchase for income tax purposes and as a result, the goodwill arising from the transaction is deductible.\nOther Intimidator Intangible Assets Acquired\nThe allocation of the Intimidator purchase price to the net assets acquired resulted in the recognition of $184.2 million of value for other intangible assets as of the Intimidator closing date. The fair values of the acquired trade names and customer-related and backlog intangible assets were determined using the income approach whereby an intangible asset's fair value is equal to the present value of future economic benefits to be derived from ownership of the asset. The useful lives of the other intangible assets were determined based on the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the intangible assets adjusted as appropriate for entity-specific factors including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, and/or other factors that may limit the useful life of the respective intangible asset. As of the Intimidator closing date, the acquired finite-lived intangible assets had a weighted average useful life of 9.5 years. The fair values of the trade names were determined using the relief from royalty method, which is based on the hypothetical royalty stream that would be received if the company were to license the respective trade name and were based on expected future revenues from the respective trade name. The weighted-average useful life of the finite-lived trade name intangible assets was determined to be 9.8 years as of the Intimidator closing date. The fair values of the customer-related and backlog intangible assets were determined using the excess earnings method and were based on the expected operating cash flows attributable to the respective intangible asset, which were determined by deducting expected economic costs, including operating expenses and contributory asset charges, from the revenue expected to be generated from the respective intangible asset. As of the Intimidator closing date, the weighted-average useful lives of the customer-related and backlog intangible assets were determined to be 9.6 years and nine months, respectively.\nImpairment\nDuring the preparation of the financial statements for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the company recorded an impairment charge of $18.0 million related to the indefinite-lived Spartan trade name intangible asset. Further, during the same period, the\ncompany recorded an impairment charge of $133.3 million related to goodwill of the Intimidator reporting unit. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, refer to refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\nAsset Acquisitions\nOn June 10, 2022, during the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the company completed the acquisition of certain assets of Voigt Smith Innovation LLC, a manufacturer of liquid deicing equipment, brine makers and applicators, related smart-connected technologies, and hydroseeding products. On June 20, 2022, during the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the company completed the acquisition of certain assets of Tornado Global Hydrovacs Ltd. (Tornado), a designer and manufacturer of hydrovac trucks. On June 21, 2022, during the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the company completed the acquisition of certain assets of River City Manufacturing, Inc., a manufacturer of custom rock saws. These asset acquisitions pertain to the company's Professional segment.\nOn November 4, 2020, during the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the company completed the acquisition of Turflynx, Lda, a developer of innovative autonomous solutions for turf management. On March 1, 2021, during the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the company completed the acquisition of Left Hand Robotics, Inc., a developer of innovative autonomous solutions for turf and snow management. These acquisitions complement and support the development of alternative power, smart-connected, and autonomous products within the company's Professional and Residential segments.\nNone of these acquisitions met the definition of business combinations as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired in each acquisition was concentrated in the respective finite-lived developed technology intangible assets. As a result, the company accounted for each of these transactions as an asset acquisition. In an asset acquisition, goodwill is not recognized, but rather, any excess purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the identifiable net assets as of the acquisition date and any direct acquisition-related transaction costs are capitalized as part of the purchase consideration. These asset acquisitions were immaterial in relation to the company's consolidated financial condition and results of operations and as a result, additional purchase accounting disclosures have been omitted.\n3 Segment Data\nThe company's businesses are organized, managed, and internally grouped into segments based on similarities in products and services. Segment selection is based on the manner in which the company's chief operating decision maker organizes segments for making operating and investment decisions and assessing performance. The company has identified twelve operating segments and has aggregated certain of those operating segments into two reportable segments: Professional and Residential. The aggregation of the company's segments is based on the segments having the following similarities: economic characteristics, types of products and services, types of production processes, type or class of customers, and method of distribution. The company's remaining activities are presented as \"Other\" due to their insignificance.\nThe Professional reportable business segment consists of turf and landscape equipment; rental, specialty, and underground construction equipment; snow and ice management equipment; and irrigation and lighting products. Turf and landscape equipment products include sports fields and grounds mowing and maintenance equipment, golf course mowing and maintenance equipment, landscape contractor mowing equipment, landscape creation and renovation equipment, and other maintenance equipment. Rental, specialty, and underground construction equipment products include horizontal directional drills, walk and ride trenchers, stand-on skid steers, vacuum excavators, stump grinders, turf renovation products, asset locators, pipe rehabilitation solutions, materials handling equipment, and other after-market tools. Snow and ice management equipment products primarily include snowplows; stand-on snow and ice removal equipment, including the related snowplow, snow brush, and snow thrower attachments; salt and sand spreaders; brine ice control products; and related parts and accessories for light and medium duty trucks, utility task vehicles, skid steers, and front-end loaders. Irrigation and lighting products consist of sprinkler heads, electric and hydraulic valves, controllers, computer irrigation central control systems, coupling systems, and ag-irrigation drip tape and hose products, as well as professionally installed landscape lighting products offered through distributors and landscape contractors that also purchase irrigation products. Professional reportable business segment products are marketed and sold mainly through a network of distributors and dealers to professional and other users, including homeowners, engaged in maintaining golf courses, sports fields, municipal properties, agricultural fields, residential and commercial landscapes, and removing snow and ice, as well as directly to government customers, rental companies, and large retailers.\nThe Residential reportable business segment primarily consists of walk power mowers, zero-turn riding mowers, snow throwers, replacement parts, and home solutions products, including grass trimmers, hedge trimmers, leaf blowers, blower-vacuums, chainsaws, string trimmers, and underground, hose, and hose-end retail irrigation products. Residential reportable business segment products are marketed and sold to homeowners through a network of distributors and dealers and through a broad array of home centers, hardware retailers, and mass retailers, as well as online.\nThe company's Other activities consists of the company's wholly-owned domestic distribution company, certain corporate activities, and the elimination of intersegment revenues and expenses. Corporate activities include general corporate expenditures (finance, human resources, legal, information technology, public relations, business development, and similar activities) and other unallocated corporate assets and liabilities, such as corporate facilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe accounting policies of the reportable business segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Related Data. The company evaluates the performance of its Professional and Residential reportable business segment results based on earnings from operations plus other income, net. The reportable business segment's operating profits or losses include direct costs incurred at the reportable business segment's operating level plus allocated expenses, such as profit sharing and manufacturing expenses.

A contract with commercial substance exists at the time the company receives and accepts a purchase or sales order under a sales contract with a customer. The company recognizes revenue when, or as, performance obligations under the terms of a contract with its customer are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of control of product or services. Control is typically transferred to the customer at the time a product is shipped, or in the case of certain agreements, when a product is delivered or as services are rendered. Revenue is recognized based on the transaction price, which is measured as the amount of consideration the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring product or rendering services pursuant to the terms of the contract with a customer. The amount of consideration the company receives and the revenue the company recognizes varies with changes in the variable consideration associated with the estimated expense of certain of the company's sales promotions and incentives programs offered to customers, as well as anticipated product returns, when applicable. The company recognizes a provision for estimated variable consideration at the time revenue is recognized as a reduction of the transaction price. If a contract contains more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price of the respective promised good or service. The company does not recognize revenue in situations where collectability from the customer is not probable and defers the recognition of revenue until collection is probable or payment is received and performance obligations are satisfied.\nFreight and shipping revenue billed to customers concurrent with revenue producing activities is included within revenue and the cost for freight and shipping is recognized as an expense within cost of sales when control has transferred to the customer. Shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the related products is transferred are treated as a fulfillment activity rather than a promised service and therefore are not considered a performance obligation. Sales, use, value-added, and other excise taxes the company collects concurrent with revenue producing activities are excluded from revenue. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract for which the performance obligations will be satisfied within the next twelve months are expensed as incurred. Incidental items, including goods or services, that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized as expense when incurred. Additionally, the company has elected not to disclose the balance of unfulfilled performance obligations for contracts with a contractual term of twelve months or less.\nThe following tables disaggregate the company's reportable segment net sales by similar product type and geographic market (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Year Ended October 31, 2023 Professional Residential Other Total\nRevenue by product type:\nEquipment $ 3,236.9 $ 819.2 $ 13.1 $ 4,069.2\nIrrigation 437.7 35.0 11.3 484.0\nTotal net sales $ 3,674.6 $ 854.2 $ 24.4 $ 4,553.2\nRevenue by geographic market:\nUnited States $ 2,898.5 $ 682.6 $ 24.4 $ 3,605.5\nInternational Countries 776.1 171.6 - 947.7\nTotal net sales $ 3,674.6 $ 854.2 $ 24.4 $ 4,553.2\nFiscal Year Ended October 31, 2022 Professional Residential Other Total\nRevenue by product type:\nEquipment $ 3,003.0 $ 1,039.2 $ 6.4 $ 4,048.6\nIrrigation 426.6 29.4 10.1 466.1\nTotal net sales $ 3,429.6 $ 1,068.6 $ 16.5 $ 4,514.7\nRevenue by geographic market:\nUnited States $ 2,737.9 $ 881.1 $ 16.5 $ 3,635.5\nInternational Countries 691.7 187.5 - 879.2\nTotal net sales $ 3,429.6 $ 1,068.6 $ 16.5 $ 4,514.7\nFiscal Year Ended October 31, 2021 Professional Residential Other Total\nRevenue by product type:\nEquipment $ 2,530.8 $ 975.8 $ 11.7 $ 3,518.3\nIrrigation 398.8 34.3 8.2 441.3\nTotal net sales $ 2,929.6 $ 1,010.1 $ 19.9 $ 3,959.6\nRevenue by geographic market:\nUnited States $ 2,268.9 $ 843.2 $ 19.9 $ 3,132.0\nInternational Countries 660.7 166.9 - 827.6\nTotal net sales $ 2,929.6 $ 1,010.1 $ 19.9 $ 3,959.6\nProduct Revenue\nThe company's product revenues are generated through sales of manufactured equipment and irrigation products, including related replacement parts and accessories. For the majority of the company's products, control is transferred and revenue is recognized when the product is shipped from the company's manufacturing facilities or distribution centers to the company's customers, which primarily consist of distributors, dealers, and mass retailers. In certain situations, the company transfers control and recognizes revenue when delivery to the customer has occurred. In limited circumstances, the company ships some of its products on a consignment basis to a customer distribution center or warehouse whereby the company retains control of the product stored at the customer's distribution center or warehouse. As the company's products are removed from the distribution center or warehouse by the customer and shipped to the retail sale location, control is transferred from the company to the customer. At that time, the company invoices the customer and recognizes revenue for these consignment transactions. The company does not offer a right of return for products shipped to the customer's retail sale location from the distribution center or warehouse. The total value of consignment inventory as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 was $38.3 million and $28.3 million, respectively.\nProduct revenue is recognized based on the transaction price, which is measured as the amount of consideration the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring control of a product to a customer. The company recognizes variable consideration as a reduction of the transaction price at the time of the initial product sale by applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under the accounting standards codification guidance for revenue from contracts with customers. Variable consideration typically occurs as a result of certain of the company's sales promotions and incentive programs that are determined to represent price concessions because the program either: (i) results in an immediate reduction of the transaction price with no anticipated future costs or consideration provided to the customer, or (ii) the company anticipates a future cost based on historical or expected future business practice for which the company does not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the future consideration provided to the customer under the program. Such programs primarily consist of off-invoice discounts, rebates, and floor plan and retail financing. The cost of off-invoice discounts are incurred at the time of sale as a reduction of the transaction price and as a result, have no future cost. For all other sales promotion and incentive programs recorded as a reduction of the transaction price at the time of the initial product sale, the company estimates variable consideration using the expected value method because the company anticipates providing a future price concession based on historical or expected future business practice or other factors. Estimates of variable consideration under the expected value method are primarily based on the terms of the sales arrangements and sales promotion and incentive programs with customers, historical payment and rebate claims experience, field inventory levels, quantity or mix of products sold, projected sales volumes, types of programs offered, and expectations for the acceptance of sales promotion and incentive programs offered in the future or changes in other relevant trends. When revenue is recognized, the estimated expense of these sales promotions and incentives programs is recorded as a reduction from gross sales within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings with a corresponding accrual recorded within sales promotions and incentives programs in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, from time to time, the company may offer its customers the right to return eligible equipment and irrigation products, replacement parts, and accessories. Such right of return offered on the company's products is also considered to be variable consideration that is estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue based primarily on historical experience, anticipated sales returns estimated from sales terms, trend analysis, and other factors. The company records the obligation for\nproduct returns within accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the right-of-return asset in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The refund liability and right-of-return asset are remeasured for changes in the estimate at each reporting date with a corresponding adjustment to net sales and cost of sales within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. There are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale.\nCollectability from the customer for product revenue is generally assumed to be probable because the company's financial exposure related to accounts receivable is reduced due to its dealer and distributor inventory financing programs. For additional information regarding these programs, refer to Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies. The company's product sales to customers that do not elect to finance product purchases are generally on open account with terms that generally approximate 30 to 120 days. The resulting receivables are included within receivables, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The company performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers on open account terms in order to assess collectability.\nService and Extended Warranty Revenue\nIn certain cases, the company renders service contracts to customers, which typically range from 12 to 60 months. The company also sells separately priced extended warranty coverage on select products for a prescribed period after the standard warranty period expires, which typically range from 12 to 24 months. Under both types of contracts, the company receives payment at the inception of the contract and recognizes revenue over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in satisfying the performance obligations under the contract.\nContract Liabilities\nContract liabilities relate to deferred revenue recognized for cash consideration received at contract inception in advance of the company's performance under the respective contract and generally relate to the sale of separately priced extended warranty contracts, service contracts, and non-refundable customer deposits. The company recognizes revenue over the term of the contract in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in satisfying the performance obligations under the separately priced extended warranty and service contracts. For non-refundable customer deposits, the company recognizes revenue as of the point in time in which the performance obligation has been satisfied under the contract with the customer, which typically occurs upon change in control at the time a product is shipped. As of October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, $25.6 million and $28.0 million, respectively, of deferred revenue associated with outstanding separately priced extended warranty contracts, service contracts, and non-refundable customer deposits was reported within accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023, the company recognized $14.7 million of the October 31, 2022 deferred revenue balance. The company expects to recognize approximately $12.0 million of the October 31, 2023 deferred revenue balance within net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in fiscal 2024 and $13.6 million thereafter.\n5 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nImpairment\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year unless events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred prior to the annual assessment. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level and the company's reporting units are its 12 operating segments. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at the individual indefinite-lived intangible asset or asset group level, as appropriate. Through the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the company previously assessed qualitative factors, including overall financial performance such as actual and projected cash flows, revenues, and earnings, and concluded it was not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived Spartan trade name intangible asset was impaired nor that the fair value of the Intimidator reporting unit was less than its carrying amount.\nDuring the preparation of the financial statements for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the company identified deterioration in year-to-date fiscal 2023 results of Intimidator compared to previous expectations and resulting downward revisions to the company's projected future results of Intimidator made during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 as part of the company's annual long range strategic planning process, including future expected cash flows, which were significantly lower than previously expected. The underperformance was attributable to summer seasonality trends that did not materialize primarily due to reduced retail demand from homeowners who prefer professional solutions. This reduced retail demand from homeowners who prefer professional solutions was driven by persistent hot and dry weather patterns across key regions, coupled with a number of macro factors, including higher interest rates, economic uncertainty, and consumer spending preferences following the exceptional demand during the pandemic. Additionally, the company had previously replenished the Intimidator customer channel, which, combined with the reduced retail demand, caused a significant reduction in shipments and customer reorders during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, as well as a material reduction in projected future financial results for Intimidator.\nBased on the above factors, the company concluded it was more likely than not that the indefinite-lived Spartan trade name intangible asset was impaired and that the fair value of the Intimidator reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. As such, the company performed quantitative impairment analyses to compare the fair value of the Spartan trade name intangible asset and the Intimidator reporting unit with their respective carrying amounts. Prior to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the company did not have a material uncertainty associated with the assets of the Intimidator reporting unit, and therefore, did not previously report an early warning disclosure.\nThe fair value of the Spartan trade name was determined using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach which utilized various inputs and assumptions, including projected revenues from the company's projection process, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if the company did not own the intangible asset, terminal growth rates applied to projected revenues, applicable tax rates, and a discount rate. The fair value of the Intimidator reporting unit under the quantitative goodwill impairment test was determined using a discounted cash flow model under the income approach which utilized various inputs and assumptions, including projected operating results and growth rates from the company's projection process, applicable tax rates, estimated capital expenditures and depreciation, estimated changes in working capital, terminal growth rates applied to projected operating results in the terminal period, and a weighted-average cost of capital rate. Inputs used to estimate these fair values included significant unobservable inputs that reflect the companys assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use and, therefore, the fair value assessments are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nAs a result of these analyses, at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the company recorded an impairment charge of $18.0 million related to the indefinite-lived Spartan trade name intangible asset reported under the Professional segment. Further, during the same period, the company recorded an impairment charge of $133.3 million related to goodwill of the Intimidator reporting unit also reported under the Professional segment. Subsequent to these impairment charges, the remaining balance of the indefinite-lived Spartan trade name intangible asset was $81.1 million and the remaining balance of goodwill for the Intimidator reporting unit was $30.5 million. The charges are included in the Non-cash impairment charges caption on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. These impairment charges resulted in a $36.7 million income tax benefit (deferred tax asset) associated with the remaining tax deductible basis in goodwill and other intangible assets.\nGoodwill\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for fiscal 2023 and 2022 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nProfessional Residential Other Total\nBalance as of October 31, 2021 $ 411.1 $ 10.6 $ - $ 421.7\nGoodwill acquired 163.7 - - 163.7\nTranslation adjustments (1.8) (0.3) - (2.1)\nBalance as of October 31, 2022 573.0 10.3 - 583.3\nNon-cash impairment charge (133.3) - - (133.3)\nTranslation adjustments 0.8 - - 0.8\nBalance as of October 31, 2023 $ 440.5 $ 10.3 $ - $ 450.8\nOther Intangible Assets\nThe components of other intangible assets were as follows (dollars in millions, except weighted-average useful life in years):\nOctober 31, 2023 Weighted-Average Useful Life in Years Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net\nPatents 9.9 $ 18.2 $ (16.0) $ 2.2\nNon-compete agreements 5.5 6.9 (6.9) -\nCustomer-related 15.8 327.5 (106.7) 220.8\nDeveloped technology 7.1 102.0 (63.1) 38.9\nTrade names 13.7 10.7 (4.0) 6.7\nBacklog and other 0.6 5.7 (5.7) -\nTotal finite-lived 13.3 471.0 (202.4) 268.6\nIndefinite-lived - trade names 271.5 - 271.5\nTotal other intangible assets, net $ 742.5 $ (202.4) $ 540.1\nOctober 31, 2022 Weighted-Average Useful Life in Years Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net\nPatents 9.9 $ 18.2 $ (15.3) $ 2.9\nNon-compete agreements 5.5 6.8 (6.8) -\nCustomer-related 16.0 321.0 (83.8) 237.2\nDeveloped technology 7.1 101.9 (53.0) 48.9\nTrade names 13.8 10.7 (3.4) 7.3\nBacklog and other 0.6 5.7 (5.5) 0.2\nTotal finite-lived 13.4 464.3 (167.8) 296.5\nIndefinite-lived - trade names 289.3 - 289.3\nTotal other intangible assets, net $ 753.6 $ (167.8) $ 585.8\nAmortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $35.7 million, $33.9 million, and $23.8 million, respectively.

Included in the revolving credit facility is a $10.0 million sublimit for standby letters of credit and a $30.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. At the company's election, and with the approval of the named borrowers on the revolving credit facility and the election of the lenders to fund such increase, the aggregate maximum principal amount available under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an amount of up to $300.0 million. Funds are available under the revolving credit facility for working capital, capital expenditures, and other lawful corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, acquisitions and common stock repurchases, subject in each case to compliance with certain financial covenants as defined in the amended credit agreement. As of October 31, 2023, the company had $40.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $2.6 million outstanding under the sublimit for standby letters of credit, resulting in $557.4 million of unutilized availability under the revolving credit facility. As of October 31, 2022, the company had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and $3.1 million outstanding under the sublimit for standby letters of credit, resulting in $596.9 million of unutilized availability under the revolving credit facility.\nOn April 27, 2022, the company further amended the amended credit agreement to transition the reference rate from LIBOR to term SOFR. As of October 31, 2023, SOFR is the reference rate in effect for all outstanding variable interest borrowings of the company.\nOn September 22, 2023, the company further amended the amended credit agreement to permit non-cash charges in its Consolidated EBIT calculation among other administrative amendments.\nOutstanding loans under the revolving credit facility (other than swingline loans), if applicable, bear interest at a variable rate generally based on SOFR or an alternative variable rate based on the highest of the Bank of America prime rate, the federal funds rate or a rate generally based on SOFR, in each case subject to an additional basis point spread as defined in the amended credit agreement. Swingline loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate determined by the swingline lender or an alternative variable rate based on the highest of the Bank of America prime rate, the federal funds rate or a rate generally based on SOFR, in each case subject to an additional basis point spread as defined in the amended credit agreement. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. The interest rate on outstanding borrowings as of October 31, 2023 was 6.34%. During fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, the company incurred interest expense of $5.7 million, $2.4 million and $0.0 million, respectively, on the outstanding borrowings under the current and prior revolving credit facilities.\nThe company's revolving credit facility contains customary covenants, including, without limitation, financial covenants, such as the maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio; and negative covenants, which among other things, limit cash dividends, disposition of assets, consolidations and mergers, liens, and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. Most of these restrictions are subject to certain minimum thresholds and exceptions. The company was in compliance with all covenants related to the amended credit agreement for the company's revolving credit facility as of October 31, 2023.\n$270.0 Million Term Loan Credit Agreement\nThe amended credit agreement executed on October 5, 2021, as further amended on April 27, 2022 and September 22, 2023, also provided for a five-year unsecured term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $270.0 million, the entire amount of which was funded on October 5, 2021 and matures on October 5, 2026 (\"$270.0 million term loan\"). Under the amended credit agreement, incremental term loan commitments may be established at the company's election and the approval of the borrowers on the $270.0 million term loan by an amount of up to $100.0 million.\nBeginning December 31, 2024, the company is required to make quarterly principal amortization payments on the $270.0 million term loan equal to 2.5% of the original aggregate principal amount reduced by any applicable prepayments. On October 5, 2026, the aggregate principal amount of any remaining outstanding borrowings under the $270.0 million term loan is required to be repaid. The $270.0 million term loan may be prepaid and terminated at the company's election at any time without penalty or premium. Amounts repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. As of October 31, 2023, there was $270.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the $270.0 million term loan.\nOutstanding borrowings under the $270.0 million term loan bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each interest period at a variable rate generally based on Term SOFR or an alternative variable rate based on the highest of the Bank of America prime rate, the federal funds rate or a rate generally based on Term SOFR, in each case subject to an additional basis point spread as defined in the amended credit agreement. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. The interest rate on outstanding borrowings as of October 31, 2023 was 6.30%. For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the company incurred interest expense of $15.9 million, $5.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively, on the outstanding borrowings under the $270.0 million term loan.\nThe $270.0 million term loan contains customary covenants, including, without limitation, financial covenants generally consistent with those applicable under the company's revolving credit facility and the company was in compliance with all covenants as of October 31, 2023.\n$200.0 Million Term Loan Credit Agreement\nOn April 27, 2022, the company entered into a term loan credit agreement (\"$200.0 million term loan\") with certain financial institutions for the purpose of paying down certain of its outstanding borrowings incurred in connection with the company's acquisition of Intimidator on January 13, 2022 and borrowed under its revolving credit facility provided under the amended credit agreement. On September 22, 2023, the company amended the $200.0 million term loan credit agreement to permit non-cash charges in its Consolidated EBIT calculation among other administrative amendments. The entire $200.0 million available under the agreement was funded on April 27, 2022, and matures on April 27, 2027. In connection with the company's entry into the $200.0 million term loan, the company incurred immaterial debt issuance costs, which are being deferred and amortized over the life of the $200.0 million term loan and are netted against the outstanding borrowings under the $200.0 million term loan within the long-term debt line item on the company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nBeginning with the last business day of June 2025, the company is required to make quarterly amortization payments on the $200.0 million term loan equal to 2.5% of the original aggregate principal amount reduced by any applicable prepayments. The $200.0 million term loan may be prepaid and terminated at the company's election at any time without penalty or premium. Amounts repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.\nOutstanding borrowings under the $200.0 million term loan bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each interest period at a variable rate generally based on Term SOFR or an alternative variable rate based on the highest of the Bank of America prime rate, the federal funds rate or a rate generally based on Term SOFR, in each case subject to an additional basis point spread as defined in the amended credit agreement. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. The interest rate on outstanding borrowings as of October 31, 2023 was 6.30%. For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, the company incurred interest expense of $11.7 million and $3.1 million, respectively, on the outstanding borrowings under the $200.0 million term loan.\nThe $200.0 million term loan contains customary covenants, including, without limitation, financial covenants generally consistent with those applicable under the company's revolving credit facility. The company was in compliance with all covenants as of October 31, 2023.\n3.81% Series A and 3.91% Series B Senior Notes\nOn April 30, 2019, the company entered into a private placement note purchase agreement with certain purchasers pursuant to which the company agreed to issue and sell an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million of 3.81% Series A Senior Notes due June 15, 2029 (\"Series A Senior Notes\") and $100.0 million of 3.91% Series B Senior Notes due June 15, 2031 (\"Series B Senior Notes\" and together with the Series A Senior Notes, the \"Senior Notes\"). On June 27, 2019, the company issued $100.0 million of the Series A Senior Notes and $100.0 million of the Series B Senior Notes pursuant to the private placement note purchase agreement. The Senior Notes are unsecured senior obligations of the company.\nNo principal is due on the Senior Notes prior to their stated due dates. The company has the right to prepay all or a portion of either series of the Senior Notes in amounts not less than 10% of the then outstanding principal amount of the series of Senior Notes being prepaid upon notice to the holders of such series for 100% of the principal amount prepaid, plus a make-whole premium, as set forth in the private placement note purchase agreement, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of prepayment. In addition, at any time on or after the date that is 90 days prior to the maturity date of the respective series, the company has the right to prepay all of the outstanding Senior Notes of such series for 100% of the principal amount so prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of prepayment. Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, the company is required to offer to prepay all Senior Notes for 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of prepayment.\nInterest on the Senior Notes is payable semiannually on the 15th day of June and December in each year. For each of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the company incurred interest expense of $7.7 million, respectively.\nThe private placement note purchase agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the company, as well as certain customary covenants, including, without limitation, financial covenants generally consistent with those applicable under the company's revolving credit facility. The company was in compliance with all covenants as of October 31, 2023.\n3.97% Senior Notes\nOn June 30, 2022, the company issued $100.0 million of 3.97% Senior Notes due June 30, 2032 (\"3.97% Senior Notes\") pursuant to a private placement note purchase agreement (\"2022 Note Purchase Agreement\") with certain purchasers. The proceeds were used pay down certain of its outstanding borrowings incurred in connection with the company's acquisition of\nIntimidator on January 13, 2022 and borrowed under its revolving credit facility provided under the amended credit agreement. In connection with the 2022 Note Purchase Agreement, the company incurred immaterial debt issuance costs, which were capitalized as contra-debt on the company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be amortized over the life of the 3.97% Senior Notes. The 3.97% Senior Notes are unsecured senior obligations of the company and mature on June 30, 2032.\nThe company has the right to prepay all or a portion of the 3.97% Senior Notes in an amount not less than 10% of the then outstanding principal amount upon notice to the holders for 100% of the prepaid principal amount plus a make-whole premium, as set forth in the 2022 Note Purchase Agreement, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of prepayment. In addition, at any time during the 90 day period ending on the maturity date of the 3.97% Senior Notes, the company will have the right to prepay all of the 3.97% Senior Notes for 100% of the principal amount prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of prepayment. Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, the company is required to offer to prepay all of the 3.97% Senior Notes for 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of prepayment.\nInterest on the 3.97% Senior Notes is payable semiannually on the 30th day of June and December in each year. For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, the company incurred interest expense of $4.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively, on the outstanding borrowings under the 3.97% Senior Notes.\nThe 2022 Note Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the company, as well as certain customary covenants, including, without limitation, financial covenants generally consistent with those applicable under the company's revolving credit facility. The company was in compliance with all covenants as of October 31, 2023.\n7.8% Debentures\nIn June 1997, the company issued $175.0 million of debt securities consisting of $75.0 million of 7.125% coupon 10-year notes and $100.0 million of 7.8% coupon 30-year debentures. The $75.0 million of 7.125% coupon 10-year notes were repaid at maturity during fiscal 2007. In connection with the issuance of $175.0 million in long-term debt securities, the company paid $23.7 million to terminate three forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $125.0 million. These swap agreements had been entered into to reduce exposure to interest rate risk prior to the issuance of the new long-term debt securities. As of the inception of one of the swap agreements, the company had received payments that were recorded as deferred income to be recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of the new debt securities. As of the date the swaps were terminated, this deferred income totaled $18.7 million. The excess termination fees over the deferred income recorded was deferred and is being recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of the debt securities issued.\nInterest on the debentures is payable semiannually on the 15th day of June and December in each year. For each of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the company incurred interest expense of $8.0 million, respectively.\n6.625% Senior Notes\nOn April 26, 2007, the company issued $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior notes due May 1, 2037 and priced at 98.513% of par value. The resulting discount of $1.9 million is being amortized over the term of the notes using the straight-line method as the results obtained are not materially different from those that would result from the use of the effective interest method. Although the coupon rate of the senior notes is 6.625%, the effective interest rate is 6.741% after taking into account the issuance discount. The senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of the company and rank equally with the company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The indentures under which the senior notes were issued contain customary covenants and event of default provisions. The company may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time at the greater of the full principal amount of the senior notes being redeemed or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis at the treasury rate plus 30 basis points, plus, in both cases, accrued and unpaid interest. In the event of the occurrence of both (i) a change of control of the company, and (ii) a downgrade of the notes below an investment grade rating by both Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services within a specified period, the company would be required to make an offer to purchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.\nInterest on the senior notes is payable semiannually on the 1st day of May and November in each year. For each of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the company incurred interest expense of $8.4 million, respectively.\n7 Investment in Joint Venture\nThe company is party to a joint venture with HDF, a subsidiary of The Huntington National Bank, established as Red Iron, the primary purpose of which is to provide customer inventory financing to certain distributors and dealers of certain of the companys products in the U.S. The company has also entered into a limited inventory repurchase agreement with Red Iron. For\nadditional information regarding the customer financing aspect of the arrangement, as well as the limited inventory purchase agreement, refer to Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies.\nThe company owns 45 percent of Red Iron and HDF owns 55 percent of Red Iron. The company accounts for its investment in Red Iron under the equity method of accounting. The company and HDF each contributed a specified amount of the estimated cash required to enable Red Iron to purchase the company's floor plan financing receivables and to provide financial support for Red Iron's floor plan financing programs. Red Iron borrows the remaining requisite estimated cash utilizing a $1,350.0 million secured revolving credit facility established under a credit agreement between Red Iron and HDF. The company's total investment in Red Iron as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 was $50.6 million and $39.3 million, respectively. The company has not guaranteed the outstanding indebtedness of Red Iron.\n8 Income Taxes\nEarnings Before Income Taxes\nEarnings before income taxes were as follows (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended October 31 2023 2022 2021\nEarnings before income taxes:\nUnited States $ 345.0 $ 491.3 $ 446.2\nForeign 55.5 61.2 53.6\nTotal earnings before income taxes $ 400.5 $ 552.5 $ 499.8\nReconciliation of Effective Tax Rate\nA reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the company's effective tax rate is summarized as follows:\nFiscal Years Ended October 31 2023 2022 2021\nStatutory federal income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nExcess deduction for stock-based compensation (1.1) (0.4) (1.5)\nState and local income taxes, net of federal benefit 1.8 2.0 1.4\nForeign operations (0.7) (0.7) (0.5)\nFederal research tax credit (2.3) (1.3) (1.4)\nForeign-derived intangible income (1.1) (0.7) (0.9)\nOther, net 0.1 (0.1) (0.1)\nEffective tax rate 17.7 % 19.8 % 18.0 %\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and allowed for 100% deduction of meals expense, delayed payment of employer payroll taxes, among other items. The company has reflected the impact of the CARES Act for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 within its Consolidated Financial Statements and such impact was not material to the company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (\"IRA\") was signed into law on August 16, 2022. Among other provisions, the IRA includes a 15% corporate minimum tax applied to large corporations, a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022 and various energy tax credits. There are no material impacts from the IRA within the Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S enacted Public Lax No. 115-97 (\"Tax Act\"), originally introduced as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which significantly modified the Internal Revenue Code.

The company has reflected the impact for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nComponents of the company's provision for income taxes were as follows (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended October 31 2023 2022 2021\nCurrent provision:\nFederal $ 94.4 $ 94.7 $ 90.2\nState 17.0 19.1 16.0\nForeign 7.3 7.7 9.2\nTotal current provision $ 118.7 $ 121.5 $ 115.4\nDeferred (benefit) provision:\nFederal $ (37.8) $ (7.4) $ (18.4)\nState (10.3) (4.9) (6.5)\nForeign 0.2 - (0.6)\nTotal deferred benefit (47.9) (12.3) (25.5)\nTotal provision for income taxes $ 70.8 $ 109.2 $ 89.9\nDeferred Income Taxes\nThe components of the company's deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended October 31 2023 2022\nDeferred income tax assets:\nCompensation and benefits $ 32.5 $ 32.9\nWarranty and insurance 37.6 35.4\nLease liabilities 35.3 20.2\nAdvertising and sales promotions and incentives 16.5 7.2\nInventory 14.4 36.4\nDeferred revenue 0.3 3.3\nOther 3.0 -\nNet operating losses and other carryforwards 5.3 6.4\nResearch and Experimentation 35.4 -\nValuation allowance (3.3) (3.2)\nDeferred income tax assets $ 177.0 $ 138.6\nDeferred income tax liabilities:\nRight-of-use assets $ (34.8) $ (19.5)\nDepreciation (60.0) (51.9)\nAmortization (68.4) (102.4)\nOther - (3.8)\nDeferred income tax liabilities (163.2) (177.6)\nDeferred income tax assets (liabilities), net $ 13.8 $ (39.0)\nAs of October 31, 2023, the company has domestic net operating loss carryforwards of $4.1 million for both federal and state income tax purposes that does not expire. As of October 31, 2023, the company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $5.1 million in foreign jurisdictions, which are comprised of $5.0 million that do not expire and $0.1 million that expires between fiscal 2035 and fiscal 2040. The company also has domestic credit carryforwards of $1.9 million that expire between fiscal 2027 and fiscal 2043.\nThe net change in the total valuation allowance between the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 was an increase of $0.1 million. The change in valuation allowance is related to domestic tax credits, capital loss carryforwards, and net operating losses that are expected to expire prior to utilization.\nThe company expects that $41.8 million of the total undistributed earnings of its foreign operations will be indefinitely reinvested. Should these earnings be distributed in the future in the form of dividends or otherwise, the company may be subject to foreign withholding taxes, state income taxes, and/or additional federal taxes for currency fluctuations. As of October 31, 2023, the unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to the companys investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries, and any withholding, state, or additional federal taxes that may be applied upon any future repatriation, are expected to be immaterial.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (dollars in millions):\nUnrecognized tax benefits as of October 31, 2022 $ 3.3\nIncrease as a result of tax positions taken during a prior period 0.2\nIncrease as a result of tax positions taken during the current period 0.6\nReductions as a result of statute of limitations lapses (0.4)\nUnrecognized tax benefits as of October 31, 2023 $ 3.7\nThe company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In addition to the unrecognized tax benefits of $3.7 million, which have been recorded as an other accrued liability within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 31, 2023, the company recorded $1.0 million of accrued interest and penalties as an other accrued liability within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 31, 2023. Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of October 31, 2023 are potential benefits of $3.8 million that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.\nThe company and its wholly owned subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and numerous state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for taxable years before fiscal 2019. The company is under audit in certain state jurisdictions and expects various statutes of limitation to expire during the next 12 months. Due to the uncertainty related to the response of taxing authorities, a range of outcomes cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\n9 Stock-Based Compensation\nOn March 15, 2022, the companys shareholders approved The Toro Company 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan (the 2022 plan), which became effective immediately and replaced The Toro Company Amended and Restated 2010 Equity and Incentive Plan, as amended (the 2010 plan) with respect to future grants of awards. The 2022 plan is administered by the Compensation & Human Resources Committee of the Board and permits the grant of nonqualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, annual performance awards, non-employee director awards and other cash-based and stock-based awards to eligible individuals. Subject to adjustment as provided in the 2022 plan, the maximum aggregate number of shares of the companys common stock authorized for issuance under the 2022 plan is equal to the sum of: (a) 1,250,000 shares, plus (b) the number of shares remaining available for grant under the 2010 plan but not subject to outstanding awards thereunder as of March 15, 2022, and plus (c) the number of shares subject to awards outstanding under the 2010 plan as of March 15, 2022 but only to the extent that such outstanding awards are forfeited, expire or otherwise terminate without the issuance of such shares. The number of unissued shares of common stock available for future stock-based compensation award grants under the 2022 plan was 3,046,609 as of October 31, 2023. All outstanding stock-based compensation awards were granted under the 2010 plan or the 2022 plan. Shares of common stock issued upon the exercise, vesting, or settlement of stock options, restricted stock units, and performance shares are issued from treasury shares.\nCompensation costs related to stock-based compensation awards were as follows (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended October 31 2023 2022 2021\nStock option awards $ 8.5 $ 10.0 $ 10.0\nPerformance share awards 2.9 5.8 6.8\nRestricted stock unit awards 6.9 5.7 4.3\nUnrestricted common stock awards 1.1 0.6 0.7\nTotal compensation cost for stock-based compensation awards $ 19.4 $ 22.1 $ 21.8\nRelated tax benefit from stock-based compensation awards $ 4.7 $ 5.3 $ 5.2\nStock Option Awards\nStock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company's common stock on the date of grant, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange and are generally granted to executive officers, other employees, and non-employee Board members on an annual basis in the first quarter of the company's fiscal year but may also be granted throughout the fiscal year in connection with hiring, mid-year promotions, leadership transition, or retention, as needed and applicable. Options generally vest one-third each year over a three-year period and have a ten-year term but in certain circumstances, the vesting requirement may be modified such that options granted to certain employees vest in full on the three-year anniversary of the date of grant and have a ten-year term. Compensation cost equal to the grant date fair value determined under the Black-Scholes valuation method is generally recognized for these awards over the vesting period. Compensation cost\nrecognized for other employees not considered executive officers or non-employee Board members is net of estimated forfeitures, which are determined at the time of grant based on historical forfeiture experience. Stock options granted to executive officers and other employees are subject to accelerated expensing if the option holder meets the retirement definition set forth in the applicable equity and incentive plan. In that case, the fair value of the options is expensed in the fiscal year of grant because generally, if the option holder is employed as of the end of the fiscal year in which the options are granted, such options will not be forfeited but continue to vest according to their schedule following retirement. Similarly, if a non-employee Board member has served on the company's Board for ten full fiscal years or more, the awards will not be forfeited but continue to vest according to their schedule following retirement. Therefore, the fair value of the options granted is fully expensed on the date of the grant.\nThe fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using various inputs and assumptions under the Black-Scholes valuation method. The expected life is a significant assumption as it determines the period for which the risk-free interest rate, stock price volatility, and dividend yield must be applied. The expected life is the average length of time in which executive officers, other employees, and non-employee Board members are expected to exercise their stock options, which is primarily based on historical exercise experience. The company groups executive officers and non-employee Board members for valuation purposes based on similar historical exercise behavior. Expected stock price volatility is based on the daily movement of the company's common stock over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life of the option. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life at the time of grant. The expected dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on the company's historical cash dividends paid, expected future cash dividends and dividend yield, and expected changes in the company's stock price.\nThe table below illustrates the weighted-average valuation assumptions used under the Black-Scholes valuation method for options granted in the following fiscal periods:\nFiscal Years Ended October 31 2023 2022 2021\nExpected life of option in years 6.31 6.19 6.21\nExpected stock price volatility 25.20 % 23.74 % 23.26 %\nRisk-free interest rate 3.79 % 1.31 % 0.55 %\nExpected dividend yield 0.95 % 0.94 % 0.86 %\nPer share weighted-average fair value at date of grant $ 33.21 $ 22.55 $ 19.39\nThe table below presents stock option activity for fiscal 2023:\nStock Option Awards Weighted-Average Exercise Price Weighted-Average\nContractual Life (years) Aggregate Intrinsic\nValue (dollars in millions)\nOutstanding as of October 31, 2022 2,986,033 $ 71.23 6.0 $ 102.1\nGranted 475,620 110.87\nExercised (389,923) 52.76\nForfeited (98,300) 107.67\nOutstanding as of October 31, 2023 2,973,430 $ 78.80 5.4 $ 32.0\nExercisable as of October 31, 2023 2,078,025 $ 68.37 4.4 $ 32.0\nAs of October 31, 2023, there was $7.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.04 years.\nThe table below presents the total market value of stock options exercised and the total intrinsic value of options exercised during the following fiscal years (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended October 31 2023 2022 2021\nMarket value of stock options exercised $ 43.4 $ 20.1 $ 40.1\nIntrinsic value of stock options exercised1\n$ 22.8 $ 9.8 $ 26.0\n1 Intrinsic value is calculated as the amount by which the stock price at exercise date exceeded the option exercise price.\nPerformance Share Awards\nThe company grants performance share awards on an annual basis in the first quarter of the company's fiscal year to executive officers and other employees under which they are entitled to receive shares of the company's common stock contingent on the achievement of performance goals of the company, which are generally measured over a three-year period. The number of shares of common stock a participant receives can be increased (up to 200 percent of target levels) or reduced (down to zero) based on the level of achievement of performance goals and will vest at the end of a three-year period. Compensation cost is\nrecognized for these awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the per share fair value, which is equal to the closing price of the company's common stock on the date of grant, and the probability of achieving each performance goal.\nFactors related to the company's performance share awards are as follows (dollars in millions, except per award data):\nFiscal Years Ended October 31 2023 2022 2021\nWeighted-average fair value per award at date of grant $ 112.14 $ 98.41 $ 90.59\nFair value of performance share awards vested $ 5.3 $ 4.8 $ 3.4\nThe table below presents fiscal 2023 activity for unvested performance share awards:\nPerformance Shares Weighted-Average Fair Value at Date of Grant\nUnvested as of October 31, 2022 195,600 $ 88.63\nGranted 66,131 112.14\nVested (46,831) 77.33\nForfeited (28,140) 106.16\nUnvested as of October 31, 2023 186,760 $ 100.57\nAs of October 31, 2023, there was $4.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance share awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.63 years.\nRestricted Stock Unit Awards\nRestricted stock unit awards are generally granted on an annual basis to certain employees that are not executive officers and occasionally may be granted, including to executive officers, in connection with hiring, mid-year promotions, leadership transition, or retention. Restricted stock unit awards generally vest one-third each year over a three-year period, or vest in full on the three-year anniversary of the date of grant. In rare circumstances, such awards may have performance-based rather than time-based vesting requirements. Compensation cost equal to the grant date fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized for these awards over the vesting period. The grant date fair value is equal to the closing price of the company's common stock on the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares subject to the restricted stock unit awards and estimated forfeitures are determined on the grant date based on historical forfeiture experience.\nFactors related to the company's restricted stock unit awards are as follows (dollars in millions, except per award data):\nFiscal Years Ended October 31 2023 2022 2021\nWeighted-average fair value per award at date of grant $ 103.40 $ 88.90 $ 97.87\nFair value of restricted stock units vested $ 6.2 $ 5.5 $ 4.5\nThe table below presents fiscal 2023 activity for unvested restricted stock units:\nRestricted Stock Units Weighted-Average Fair Value at Date\nof Grant\nUnvested as of October 31, 2022 150,677 $ 90.39\nGranted 99,081 103.40\nVested (57,727) 89.16\nForfeited (12,205) 93.26\nUnvested as of October 31, 2023 179,826 $ 97.66\nAs of October 31, 2023, there was $9.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.23 years.\nUnrestricted Common Stock Awards\nDuring fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, 10,329, 6,453, and 8,070 shares, respectively, of fully vested unrestricted common stock awards were granted to certain Board members as a component of their compensation for their service on the Board and were recorded within selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Additionally, our Board members may elect to convert a portion or all of their calendar year annual retainers otherwise payable in cash into shares of the company's common stock.\nDeferred Compensation Plan\nThe company maintains a deferred compensation plan that allows executive officers and certain other employees that receive performance share awards to defer receipt of shares of the company's common stock paid out under such awards to a date in the future. Participants can defer up to 100 percent of the common stock payout and are always 100 percent vested in their accounts. Common stock payout deferrals under this plan are held in a rabbi trust and treated in a manner similar to treasury shares and are recorded at cost within stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 31, 2023 and 2022. The total of common stock required to settle this deferred compensation obligation is included in the denominator of the calculation of both basic and diluted net earnings per share of common stock.\n10 Stockholders' Equity\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn December 4, 2018, the company's Board authorized the repurchase of 5,000,000 shares of common stock in open-market or in privately negotiated transactions under the authorized stock repurchase program. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, the company paid $60.0 million and $140.0 million to repurchase 577,115 and 1,525,856 shares, respectively, under the authorized repurchase program. As of October 31, 2023, 1,949,491 shares remained available for repurchase under the December 4, 2018 tranche of authorized shares under the company's stock repurchase program. This program has no expiration date but may be terminated by the Board at any time.

These financing arrangements are structured as an advance in the form of a payment by the financial institutions to the company on behalf of a distributor or dealer with respect to invoices financed by the financial institution. These payments extinguish the obligation of the dealer or distributor to make payment to the company under the terms of the applicable invoice.\nUnder separate agreements between the financial institutions and the dealers and distributors, the financial institutions provide loans to the dealers and distributors for the advances paid by the financial institutions to the company. Under these financing arrangements, down payments are not required, and depending on the finance program for each product line, finance charges are incurred by the company, shared between the company and the distributor and/or the dealer, or paid by the distributor or dealer. The financial institutions retain a security interest in the distributors' and dealers' financed inventories and such inventories are monitored regularly through audits. Financing terms to the distributors and dealers require payment as the inventory, which secures the indebtedness, is sold to end-users or when payment otherwise become due under the agreements between the financial institutions and the distributors and dealers, whichever occurs first. Rates are generally indexed to SOFR, or an alternative variable rate, plus a fixed percentage that differs based on whether the financing is for a distributor or dealer. Rates may also vary based on the product that is financed.\nThe net amount of receivables financed for dealers and distributors under this arrangement with Red Iron during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $2,789.5 million, $2,627.5 million, and $2,282.6 million, respectively. The total amount of net receivables outstanding under this arrangement with Red Iron as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1,019.0 million and $776.1 million, respectively. The total amount of receivables due from Red Iron to the company as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 were $34.4 million and $17.7 million, respectively.\nThe net amount of receivables financed for dealers and distributors under the arrangements with HCFC and the other third-party financial institutions during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $545.4 million, $633.5 million, and $460.5 million, respectively. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, $234.7 million and $220.0 million, respectively, of receivables financed by HCFC and the other third-party financial institutions were outstanding.\nInventory Repurchase Agreements\nThe company has entered into a limited inventory repurchase agreement with Red Iron and HCFC under which the company has agreed to repurchase certain repossessed products, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $7.5 million in a calendar year.\nThe company has also entered into inventory repurchase agreements with the other third-party financial institutions under which the company has agreed to repurchase certain repossessed products. Under these agreements, for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, the company was contingently liable to repurchase up to $32.2 million and $80.0 million of repossessed inventory, respectively. The company's financial exposure under these inventory repurchase agreements is limited to the difference between the amount paid to Red Iron, HCFC or other third-party financing institutions for repurchases of inventory and the amount received upon subsequent resale of the repossessed product. The company has repurchased immaterial amounts of inventory pursuant to such arrangements during the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nEnd-User Financing\nThe company has agreements with third-party financing companies to provide financing options to end-customers throughout the world. The company has no material contingent liabilities for residual value or credit collection risk under these agreements with third-party financing companies. From time to time, the company enters into agreements where it provides recourse to third-party finance companies in the event of default by the end-customer for financing payments to the third-party finance company. The company's maximum exposure for credit collection for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 was $5.2 million and $8.6 million, respectively.\nPurchase Commitments\nAs of October 31, 2023, the company had $28.7 million of noncancelable purchase commitments with certain of the company's suppliers for commodities as part of the normal course of business. Additionally, associated with the Tornado asset acquisition described in Note 2, Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions, the company has entered into a minimum purchase arrangement for a total of approximately $35 million of inventory through fiscal 2025. As of October 31, 2023, the company did not have material noncancelable purchase commitments related to capital expenditures for renovation and expansion efforts at the company's facilities and other property, plant and equipment.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, the company is party to litigation in the ordinary course of business. Such matters are generally subject to uncertainties and to outcomes that are not predictable with assurance and that may not be known for extended periods of time. Litigation occasionally involves claims for punitive, as well as compensatory, damages arising out of the use of the company's products. Although the company is self-insured to some extent, the company maintains insurance against certain product liability losses. The company is also subject to litigation and administrative and judicial proceedings with respect to claims involving asbestos and the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment. Some of these claims assert damages and liability for personal injury, remedial investigations or clean-up and other costs and damages. The company is also occasionally involved in commercial disputes, employment disputes, and patent litigation cases in which it is asserting or defending against patent infringement claims. To prevent possible infringement of the company's patents by others, the company periodically reviews competitors' products. To avoid potential liability with respect to others' patents, the company reviews certain patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and foreign patent offices. The company believes these activities help minimize its risk of being a defendant in patent infringement litigation.\nThe company records a liability in its Consolidated Financial Statements for costs related to claims, including future legal costs, settlements, and judgments, where the company has assessed that a loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range, the company records the most probable estimate of the loss or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. The company discloses a contingent liability even if the liability is not probable or the amount is not estimable, or both, if there is a reasonable possibility that a material loss may have been incurred. In the opinion of management, the amount of liability, if any, with respect to these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not materially affect the company's consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In situations where the company receives, or expects to receive, a favorable ruling related to a litigation settlement, the company follows the accounting standards codification guidance for gain contingencies. The company does not allow for the recognition of a gain contingency within its Consolidated Financial Statements prior to the settlement of the underlying events or contingencies associated with the gain contingency. As a result, the consideration related to a gain contingency is recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements during the period in which all underlying events or contingencies are resolved and the gain is realized.\nLitigation Settlement\nOn November 19, 2020, Exmark Manufacturing Company Incorporated (\"Exmark\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, and Briggs & Stratton Corporation (BGG) entered into a settlement agreement (Settlement Agreement) relating to the decade-long patent infringement litigation that Exmark originally filed in May 2010 against Briggs & Stratton Power Products Group, LLC (BSPPG), a former wholly-owned subsidiary of BGG (Case No. 8:10CV187, U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska) (the Infringement Action). In the Infringement Action, Exmark alleged that certain mower decks manufactured by BSPPG infringed an Exmark mower deck patent. Despite favorable judgments in the Infringement Action in favor of Exmark, including with regard to awarded damages, actions by BGG during the second half of calendar year 2020 put in jeopardy the certainty and timing of the eventual receipt of the damages awarded to Exmark in the Infringement Action, including (i) the filing by BGG and certain of its subsidiaries for bankruptcy relief under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (BGG Bankruptcy); (ii) the sale of substantially all the assets (but not certain liabilities, including the Infringement Action) of BGG and its subsidiaries to a third-party pursuant to Section 363 of the United States Bankruptcy Code; and (iii) a petition filed by BGG for a panel rehearing of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's decision in the Infringement Action (Rehearing Petition).\nAs a result, on November 19, 2020, Exmark entered into the Settlement Agreement with BGG which provided, among other things, that (i) upon approval by the bankruptcy court, and such approval becoming final and nonappealable, BGG agreed to pay Exmark $33.65 million (Settlement Amount), (ii) BGG agreed to immediately withdraw the Rehearing Petition and otherwise not pursue additional appellate review regarding the Infringement Action, and (iii) after receipt of the Settlement Amount, Exmark agreed to release a supersedeas appeal bond that had been obtained by BGG to support payment of the damages awarded to Exmark in the Infringement Action. On November 20, 2020, BGG filed a motion to withdraw the Rehearing Petition and on December 16, 2020, the bankruptcy court approved the Settlement Agreement. During January 2021, the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Settlement Amount was received by Exmark in connection with the settlement of the Infringement Action and at such time, the underlying events and contingencies associated with the gain contingency related to the Infringement Action were satisfied. As such, the company recognized in selling, general and administrative expense within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 (i) the gain associated with the Infringement Action and (ii) a corresponding expense related to the contingent fee arrangement with the company's external legal counsel customary in patent infringement cases equal to approximately 50 percent of the Settlement Amount.\n12 Leases\nThe company enters into contracts that are, or contain, operating lease agreements for certain property, plant, or equipment assets utilized in the normal course of business, such as buildings for manufacturing facilities, office space, distribution centers, and warehouse facilities; land for product testing sites; machinery and equipment for research and development activities, manufacturing and assembly processes, and administrative tasks; and vehicles for sales, service, marketing, and distribution activities. Contracts that explicitly or implicitly relate to property, plant, and equipment are assessed at inception to determine if the contract is, or contains, a lease. Such contracts for operating lease agreements convey the company's right to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from, an identified asset for a defined period of time in exchange for consideration.\nThe lease term begins and is determined upon lease commencement, which is the point in time when the company takes possession of the identified asset, and includes all non-cancelable periods. The lease term may also include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that such options will be exercised after considering all relevant economic and financial factors. Options to extend or terminate a lease are generally exercisable at the company's sole discretion, subject to any required minimum notification period and/or other contractual terms as defined within the respective lease agreement, as applicable. The company's renewal options generally range from extended terms of two to ten years. Certain leases also include options to purchase the identified asset. Lease expense for the company's operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expense within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings depending on the nature and use of the identified asset underlying the respective operating lease arrangement. The company does not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, but does recognize expense on a straight-line basis, for short-term operating leases which have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset.\nLease payments are determined at lease commencement and represent fixed lease payments as defined within the respective lease agreement or, in the case of certain lease agreements, variable lease payments that are measured as of the lease commencement date based on the prevailing index or market rate. Future adjustments to variable lease payments are defined and scheduled within the respective lease agreement and are determined based upon the prevailing market or index rate at the time of the adjustment relative to the market or index rate determined at lease commencement. Certain other lease agreements contain variable lease payments that are determined based upon actual utilization of the identified asset. Such future adjustments to variable lease payments and variable lease payments based upon actual utilization of the identified asset are not included within the determination of lease payments at commencement but rather, are recorded as variable lease expense in the period in which the variable lease cost is incurred. Additionally, the company's operating leases generally do not include material residual value guarantees. The company has operating leases with both lease components and non-lease components. For all underlying asset classes, the company accounts for lease components separately from non-lease components based on the relative market value of each component. Non-lease components typically consist of common area maintenance, utilities, and/or other repairs and maintenance services. The costs related to non-lease components are not included within the determination of lease payments at commencement.\nRight-of-use assets represent the company's right to use an underlying asset throughout the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease agreement. The company accounts for operating lease liabilities at lease commencement and on an ongoing basis as the present value of the minimum remaining lease payments under the respective lease term. Minimum remaining lease payments are discounted to present value based on the rate implicit in the operating lease agreement or the estimated incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement if the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. Generally, the estimated incremental borrowing rate is used as the rate implicit in the\nlease is not readily determinable. The estimated incremental borrowing rate represents the rate of interest that the company would have to pay to borrow on a general and unsecured collateralized basis over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The company determines the estimated incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement based on available information at such time, including lease term, lease currency, and geographical market. Right-of-use assets are measured as the amount of the corresponding operating lease liability for the respective operating lease agreement, adjusted for prepaid or accrued lease payments, the remaining balance of any lease incentives received, unamortized initial direct costs, and impairment of the operating lease right-of-use asset, as applicable.\nThe following table presents the lease expense incurred on the companys operating, short-term, and variable leases (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Year Ended October 31 2023 2022 2021\nOperating lease expense $ 24.0 $ 22.6 $ 20.4\nShort-term lease expense 4.5 4.5 2.9\nVariable lease expense - - 0.1\nTotal lease expense $ 28.5 $ 27.1 $ 23.4\nThe following table presents supplemental cash flow information related to the company's operating leases (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Year Ended October 31 2023 2022 2021\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 67.6 $ 27.0 $ 5.4\nOperating cash flows for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 20.9 $ 19.2 $ 18.9\nThe following table presents other lease information related to the company's operating leases as of October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022:\nOctober 31, 2023 October 31, 2022\nWeighted-average remaining lease term of operating leases in years 9.3 6.0\nWeighted-average discount rate of operating leases 4.83 % 3.53 %\nThe following table reconciles the total undiscounted future cash flows based on the anticipated future minimum operating lease payments by fiscal year for the company's operating leases to the present value of operating lease liabilities recorded within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 31, 2023 (dollars in millions):\nOctober 31, 2023\n2024 $ 25.1\n2025 23.3\n2026 17.4\n2027 13.9\n2028 11.8\nThereafter 69.6\nTotal future minimum operating lease payments 161.1\nLess: imputed interest 29.5\nPresent value of operating lease liabilities $ 131.6\n13 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nRisk Management Objective of Using Derivatives\nThe company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such as sales to third-party customers, sales and loans to wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries, costs associated with foreign plant operations, and purchases from suppliers. The companys primary currency exchange rate exposures are with the Euro, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, the British pound, the Mexican peso, the Japanese yen, the Chinese Renminbi, and the Romanian New Leu against the U.S. dollar, as well as the Romanian New Leu against the Euro.\nTo reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, the company actively manages the exposure of its foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into various derivative instruments to hedge against such risk, authorized under a company policy that places controls on these hedging activities, with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions.\nThe companys policy does not allow the use of derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The company has also made an accounting policy election to use the portfolio exception with respect to measuring counterparty credit risk for derivative instruments and to measure the fair value of a portfolio of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the net open risk position with each counterparty.\nThe companys hedging activities primarily involve the use of forward currency contracts to hedge most foreign currency transactions, including projected sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies. The company uses derivative instruments only in an attempt to limit underlying exposure from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Decisions on whether to use such derivative instruments are primarily based on the amount of exposure to the currency involved and an assessment of the near-term market value for each currency. The company recognizes all derivative instruments at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedging instrument.\nCash Flow Hedging Instruments\nThe company formally documents relationships between cash flow hedging instruments and the related hedged transactions, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking cash flow hedging instruments. This process includes linking all cash flow hedging instruments to the projected transactions, such as sales to third-parties and costs associated with foreign plant operations, including purchases from suppliers. At the cash flow hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, the company formally assesses whether the cash flow hedging instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged transactions and whether those cash flow hedging instruments may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Changes in the fair values of the spot rate component of outstanding, highly effective cash flow hedging instruments included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in other comprehensive income within AOCL on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are subsequently reclassified to net earnings within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings during the same period in which the cash flows of the underlying hedged transaction affect net earnings. Changes in the fair values of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized immediately in net earnings under the mark-to-market approach. The classification of gains or losses recognized on cash flow hedging instruments and excluded components within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings is the same as that of the underlying exposure. Results of cash flow hedging instruments, and the related excluded components, of sales and costs associated with foreign plant operations, including purchases from suppliers, are recorded in net sales and cost of sales, respectively. The maximum amount of time the company hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for projected trade sales and purchases is two years.\nWhen it is determined that a derivative instrument is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a cash flow hedge, the company discontinues cash flow hedge accounting prospectively. The gain or loss on the dedesignated derivative instrument remains in AOCL and is reclassified to net earnings within the same Consolidated Statements of Earnings line item as the underlying exposure when the projected transaction affects net earnings. When the company discontinues cash flow hedge accounting because it is no longer probable, but it is still reasonably possible that the projected transaction will occur by the end of the originally expected period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument remains in AOCL and is reclassified to net earnings within the same Consolidated Statements of Earnings line item as the underlying exposure when the projected transaction affects net earnings. However, if it is probable that a projected transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were in AOCL are immediately recognized in net earnings within other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In all situations in which cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative instrument remains outstanding, the company carries the derivative instrument at its fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, recognizing future changes in the fair value within other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As of October 31, 2023, the notional amount outstanding of forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments was $307.5 million.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Cash Flow Hedging Instruments\nThe company also enters into foreign currency contracts that include forward currency contracts to mitigate the remeasurement of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These contracts are not designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of hedges of recorded balance sheet positions, such as cash, receivables, payables, intercompany notes, and other various contractual claims to pay or receive foreign currencies other than the functional currency, are recognized immediately in other income, net, on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings together with the transaction gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position.\nThe following table presents the fair value and location of the companys derivative instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (dollars in millions):\nFair Value as of October 31 2023 2022\nDerivative assets:\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments:\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\nForward currency contracts $ 13.7 $ 27.7\nDerivatives not designated as cash flow hedging instruments:\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\nForward currency contracts 3.1 5.5\nTotal derivative assets $ 16.8 33.2\nDerivative liabilities:\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments:\nAccrued liabilities\nForward currency contracts $ - $ -\nDerivatives not designated as cash flow hedging instruments:\nAccrued liabilities\nForward currency contracts - -\nTotal derivative liabilities $ - $ -\nThe company entered into an International Swap Dealers Association (\"ISDA\") Master Agreement with each counterparty that permits the net settlement of amounts owed under their respective contracts. The ISDA Master Agreement is an industry standardized contract that governs all derivative contracts entered into between the company and the respective counterparty. Under these master netting agreements, net settlement generally permits the company or the counterparty to determine the net amount payable or receivable for contracts due on the same date or in the same currency for similar types of derivative transactions. The company records the fair value of its derivative instruments at the net amount on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table presents the effects of the master netting arrangements on the fair value of the companys derivative instruments that are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (dollars in millions):\nFair Value as of October 31 2023 2022\nDerivative assets:\nForward currency contracts:\nGross amount of derivative assets $ 16.8 $ 33.2\nDerivative liabilities offsetting derivative assets - -\nNet amount of derivative assets $ 16.8 $ 33.2\nDerivative liabilities:\nForward currency contracts:\nGross amount of derivative liabilities $ - $ -\nDerivative assets offsetting derivative liabilities - -\nNet amount of derivative liabilities $ - $ -\nThe following table presents the impact and location of the amounts reclassified from AOCL into net earnings on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and the impact of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the company's derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments (dollars in millions):\nGain Reclassified from AOCL into Income (Loss) Gain Recognized in OCI on Derivatives\nFiscal Years Ended October 31 2023 2022 2023 2022\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments:\nForward currency contracts:\nNet sales $ 10.8 $ 4.5 $ (12.9) $ 21.2\nCost of sales 4.5 0.6 0.1 3.2\nTotal derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments $ 15.3 $ 5.1 $ (12.8) $ 24.4\nDuring fiscal 2023 and 2022, the company recognized immaterial losses and gains, respectively, within other income, net on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings due to the discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting on certain forward currency\ncontracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments. As of October 31, 2023, the company expects to reclassify approximately $8.6 million of gains from AOCL to earnings during the next twelve months.\nThe following tables present the impact and location of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the companys derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments and the related components excluded from hedge effectiveness testing (dollars in millions):\nGain Recognized in Earnings on Cash Flow Hedging Instruments\nFiscal Year Ended October 31, 2023 Net Sales Cost of Sales\nTotal Consolidated Statements of Earnings income (expense) amounts in which the effects of cash flow hedging instruments are recorded $ 4,553.2 $ (2,975.6)\nGain on derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments:\nForward currency contracts:\nAmount of gain reclassified from AOCL into earnings 10.8 4.5\nGain on components excluded from effectiveness testing recognized in earnings based on changes in fair value $ 2.2 $ 2.6\n(Loss) Gain Recognized in Earnings on Cash Flow Hedging Instruments\nFiscal Year Ended October 31, 2022 Net Sales Cost of Sales\nTotal Consolidated Statements of Earnings income (expense) amounts in which the effects of cash flow hedging instruments are recorded $ 4,514.7 $ (3,010.1)\nGain (loss) on derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments:\nForward currency contracts:\nAmount of gain reclassified from AOCL into earnings 4.5 0.6\n(Loss) gain on components excluded from effectiveness testing recognized in earnings based on changes in fair value $ (1.1) $ 1.7\nThe following table presents the impact and location of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the companys derivatives not designated as cash flow hedging instruments (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended October 31 2023 2022\n(Loss) gain on derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedging instruments:\nForward currency contracts:\nOther (expense) income, net $ (6.3) $ 4.2\nTotal (loss) gain on derivatives not designated as cash flow hedging instruments $ (6.3) $ 4.2\n14 Fair Value Measurements\nThe company categorizes its assets and liabilities into one of three levels based on the assumptions (inputs) used in valuing the asset or liability. Estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the accounting guidance for fair value measurements. The framework defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value, and requires certain disclosures. The framework discusses valuation techniques such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flows), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The framework utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, while Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows:\nLevel 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting management's assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nThe company's derivative instruments consist of forward currency contracts that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of such forward currency contracts is determined based on observable market transactions of forward currency prices and spot currency rates as of the reporting date.\nThe following tables present, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the company's financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, according to the valuation technique utilized to determine their fair values (dollars in millions):\nFair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as:\nOctober 31, 2023 Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nForward currency contracts $ 16.8 $ - $ 16.8 $ -\nTotal assets $ 16.8 $ - $ 16.8 $ -\nLiabilities:\nForward currency contracts $ - $ - $ - $ -\nTotal liabilities $ - $ - $ - $ -\nFair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as:\nOctober 31, 2022 Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nForward currency contracts $ 33.2 $ - $ 33.2 $ -\nTotal assets $ 33.2 $ - $ 33.2 $ -\nLiabilities:\nForward currency contracts $ - $ - $ - $ -\nTotal liabilities $ - $ - $ - $ -\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\nThe company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include long-lived assets, goodwill, and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which would generally be recorded at fair value as a result of an impairment charge. For additional information regarding impairment related fair value measurements, refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
