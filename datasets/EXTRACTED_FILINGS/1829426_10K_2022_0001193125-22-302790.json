    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nBusiness\nFPAC is a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on October 19, 2020. The Company was incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (a Business Combination). The Company is not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from October 19, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2022 relates to the Companys formation and the initial public offering (Initial Public Offering), and since closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective initial Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.\nThe Companys sponsor is Far Peak LLC, a Cayman Islands exempted limited liability company (sponsor). The registration statement for the Companys Initial Public Offering was declared effective on December 2, 2020. On December 7, 2020, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 55,000,000 units (the Units and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the Public Shares), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $550.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $23.7 million, inclusive of $7.5 million in underwriting commissions, approximately $15.4 million in deferred underwriting commissions (which were subsequently waived in May 2022), $400,000 in deferred legal fees, approximately $4.0 million of other expenses, and net of reimbursement from the underwriters of $3.6 million. The underwriters were granted a 45-day option from the date of the final prospectus relating to the Initial Public Offering to purchase up to 8,250,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at $10.00 per Unit. On December 21, 2020, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option and purchased an additional 5,000,000 Units at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000 (the Over-Allotment Option).\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private placement (Private Placement) of 7,000,000 warrants (each, a Private Placement Warrant and collectively, the Private Placement Warrants), at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant with the sponsor and certain funds and accounts managed by subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively, the Anchor Investor), generating gross proceeds of $10.5 million.\nUpon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, $550.0 million ($10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, and upon the completion of the Over-Allotment Option a further $50.0 million of net proceeds of the sale of Units, were placed in a trust account (trust account) and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act), with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earliest of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds in the trust account to the Companys shareholders.\nThe Proposed Business Combination with Bullish\nOn July 8, 2021, as disclosed in the Companys Form 8-K filed July 9, 2021, the Company entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the Business Combination Agreement), by and among (i) FPAC, (ii) Bullish, a Cayman\nIslands exempted company (Bullish), (iii) BMC 1, a Cayman Islands exempted company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Bullish, (iv) BMC 2, a Cayman Islands exempted company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Bullish and (v) Bullish Global, a Cayman Islands exempted company.\nConcurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, certain investors (the PIPE Investors) had entered into share subscription agreements pursuant to which the PIPE Investors had committed to subscribe for and purchase Bullish Class A Ordinary Shares at $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $300,000,000. The PIPE Investors included existing shareholders of Bullish Global or their respective affiliates. One PIPE Investor (the Anchor Subscriber), who had subscribed for 7,500,000 Bullish Class A Ordinary Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $75,000,000, had also entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Bullish and our sponsor pursuant to which the Anchor Subscriber will purchase, for $1.00 per warrant for Bullish Class A Ordinary Shares (each, a Bullish Warrant), from the sponsor or the Anchor Investor, 3,000,000 outstanding Bullish Warrants. All commitments from the PIPE Investors, including the Anchor Subscriber, have expired in accordance with their terms on July 8, 2022.\nConcurrently with the execution of the BCA, the sponsor, FPAC, certain insiders of FPAC and Bullish entered into an amendment to that certain Letter Agreement, dated as of December 4, 2020, by and among the Sponsor and those certain insiders (the Letter Agreement Amendment), to be effective upon closing, with respect to certain lock-up arrangements, which provides that the sponsor and such FPAC insiders will not, within certain periods of time from the closing of the Bullish Transaction and subject to certain exceptions, sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant of any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or agree to dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate with respect to or decrease a call equivalent position, any of the Bullish Class A ordinary shares issued in connection with the Bullish Transaction, or enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any security, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise, or publicly announce any intention to effect any such transaction.\nAdditionally, the sponsor agreed that at the closing of the Business Combination, it would (a) (i) forfeit for cancellation 1,950,000 Bullish Class A Ordinary Shares at the closing of the Business Combination if more than 15,000,000 Class A ordinary shares of FPAC are validly tendered for redemption and not withdrawn (the Forfeiture), or (ii) if no such Forfeiture occurs, be subject to additional lock-up restrictions with respect to such 1,950,000 Bullish Class A Ordinary Share (including 390,000 that will be transferred to the Anchor Investor as described below), and (b) forfeit for cancellation 400,000 Bullish Warrants.\nConcurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, each Anchor Investor entered into a side letter agreement (each, a Side Letter and, collectively, the Side Letters) amending such Anchor Investors, Subscription Agreement, dated November 12, 2020, by and between such Anchor Investor, the Company and the Sponsor (the BR Subscription Agreements) which provides that such Anchor Investor will not, within certain periods of time from the closing of the Business Combination and subject to certain exceptions, sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant of any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or agree to dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate with respect to or decrease a call equivalent position, any of the Bullish Class A Ordinary Shares issued in connection with the Bullish Transaction, or enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any security, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise, or publicly announce any intention to effect any such transaction.\nPursuant to the BR Subscription Agreements, the sponsor has agreed to transfer 1,950,000 Class B ordinary shares of FPAC (which will convert into 1,950,000 Bullish Class A Ordinary Shares) to the Anchor Investor at the price the sponsor originally paid for such shares (which was nominal). Pursuant to the Side Letters, the Anchor Investor agreed that (a) (i) if the Forfeiture occurs, the sponsor will convey to them 390,000 fewer\nBullish Class A Ordinary Shares than the Anchor Investor otherwise would have received pursuant to the BR Subscription Agreements, and (ii) if no such Forfeiture occurs, such 390,000 Bullish Class A Ordinary Shares will be subject to additional lock-up restrictions and (b) at the closing of the Business Combination, the Anchor Investor will (i) sell an aggregate 600,000 Bullish Warrants at a purchase price of $1.00 per Bullish Warrant to the Anchor Subscriber (comprising a portion of the Bullish 3,000,000 Warrants that the Anchor Subscriber is entitled to purchase under the Securities Purchase Agreement) and (ii) forfeit for cancellation an aggregate 100,000 Bullish Warrants.\nIn connection with the Business Combination, certain related agreements have been, or will be, entered into on or prior to the closing of the Business Combination, including: the Lock-Up Agreement, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and among Block.one and Bullish Global; the Letter Agreement Amendment; the Side Letters; the Target Voting Agreement, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and among FPAC, Block.one, Bullish Global and Bullish; the sponsor Voting Agreement, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and among FPAC, the sponsor, Bullish Global and Bullish; the Non-Competition Agreement, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and among Block.one, Brendan Blumer, FPAC, Bullish and Bullish Global; the Standstill Agreement, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and among Bullish, Block.one, Brendan Blumer and Kokuei Yuan; the Indemnification Agreement, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and between Block.one and Bullish; and the Sponsor Release, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and between the sponsor and FPAC.\nOn June 29, 2022, Bullish and the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to the BCA (the Third Business Combination Agreement Amendment) to further extend the outside date of July 8, 2022 (the Outside Date) to December 31, 2022 in order to facilitate the completion of the Transactions.\nOn October 31, 2022 Bullish and the Company jointly announced that, subject to various approvals and conditions, including the approval by Far Peaks shareholders, their business combination is anticipated to close in mid- to late- December 2022. The parties also announced that the BCA would be terminated on December 31, 2022 if the proposed business combination has not been completed on or before this date. Except as specifically discussed, this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not assume the closing of the Business Combination with Bullish.\nAlternative Business Combination\nIf we cannot complete our initial business combination with Bullish by December 31, 2022, it is likely we will not be able to complete any business combination. However, we may consider seeking an alternative business transaction by the end date provided in our constituent documents, March 7, 2023 (alternative business transaction). If an alternative business combination is not consummated by March 7, 2023 then we may seek an extension. However, the most likely outcome will be that we will proceed with the redemption of our shares and the liquidation of the Trust as further described in the section entitled - Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination.\nReference herein to our initial business combination refers to the proposed business combination with Bullish or, if we elect to pursue one, an alternative business transaction as the context requires.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that can benefit from the managerial and operational experience of our officers and directors. We believe that the wide networks of our management team will deliver access to a broad spectrum of opportunities across the Fintech landscape. In addition, we believe the relatively smaller number of our founder shares, 9,750,000 Class B ordinary shares purchased by the sponsor in consideration of $25,000 (the Founder Shares), and relatively smaller amount of deferred underwriting commissions ($15,437,500), will make us an attractive candidate for a business combination target as we will offer an overall lower cost of capital compared to other special purpose acquisition companies.\nConsistent with our industry focus, we intend to target Fintech businesses that we consider having strong management teams, robust growth prospects and that provide a differentiated product or service. Opportunities range from high-growth, customer facing technologies in money transfer, payments, lending and cryptocurrency to more mature, high-margin, stable businesses providing critical processing and support to established financial services firms.\nThe past decade has witnessed rapid development in financial services related technological innovation across the following sub-sectors:\nRetail banking and payments\nWealth management and roboadvisors\nExchanges and trading platforms\nBig data and artificial intelligence\nEnterprise software solutions, back-office processing and other tech-enabled services\nBlockchain technology and cryptocurrencies\nRisk and compliance solutions\nThese trends were accelerating in development and adoption prior to the COVID-19 outbreak and are likely to accelerate further as a result of the pandemic. Work from home, collaborative software tools, cybersecurity, digital payments, increasing amounts of data and artificial intelligence are all being produced and used at higher rates as consumers and businesses adopt Fintech solutions across all facets of their lives and work in response to COVID-19. This shift in how we use technology and information services is likely to continue and change the way businesses create value for their shareholders and customers. We believe these changes may produce new opportunities and potential business combination targets that were not viable prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWith increased adoption of Fintech solutions by both customers and businesses, we believe that the sector is poised for continued growth in both overall market size and penetration. We do not intend to limit our search to one segment of the Fintech ecosystem, but will instead target a wide variety of companies that deliver a technology solution to the financial services end-market, inclusive of both consumer and back-office services. We believe that our extensive experience and demonstrated success in both investing and operating businesses in this industry has culminated in a unique set of capabilities that will be utilized in generating shareholder returns, such as:\nManagement and operating expertise: Our management team has extensive Fintech experience spanning market data, exchanges of numerous asset classes, clearinghouses, consumer banking and credit, brokerage and software development for risk management and compliance. Our management team has helped businesses increase revenue and margins, develop new products, reduce costs, navigate complex regulatory environments, evaluate and execute strategic acquisitions and raise capital.\nExtensive network: Thomas W, Farley, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, has been the chief executive of 15 financial technology companies and subsidiaries during his career. Through these leadership positions Mr. Farley has developed an extensive network of high caliber executives who may assist in future value creation at target companies. Mr. Farley and Mr. Bonanno have existing relationships with senior partners at most of the Top 50 private equity firms.\nCapital markets expertise: Our management team has participated in over 400 IPOs and has significant experience developing public market investor communications and raising debt and equity capital in both public and private markets.\nStatus as a public company: Many venture capital, entrepreneur or private equity-owned companies lack the public market currency needed to grow and take the next step in its evolution. We believe that our company will provide a solution that will enable accelerated growth of the target.\nInitial Business Combination\nSo long as our securities are then listed on the NYSE, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target companys business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the companys assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.\nWe anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our holders of the public shares (public shareholders) own shares or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor.\nTo the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.\nThe time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved, If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior March 31st, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nEffecting Our Initial Business Combination\nGeneral\nWe are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations other than pursuing and reviewing potential opportunities for the initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination , shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing or other sources. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.\nIf our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-business combination company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.\nWe may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account, or because we\nbecome obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise.\nSources of Target Businesses\nIf our initial business combination is an alternative business transaction, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since some of these sources will have read the prospectus and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finders fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arms length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finders fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction; in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or their respective affiliates, be paid by us any finders fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-business combination company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.\nWe are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.\nEach of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, including entities that are affiliates of our sponsor, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law.\nLack of Business Diversification\nFor an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:\nsubject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and\ncause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.\nLimited Ability to Evaluate the Targets Management Team\nIf our initial business combination is an alternative business transaction, we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target businesss management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.\nWe cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.\nFollowing a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.\nShareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination\nWe may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval of the business combination with Bullish, and with respect to any alternative business transaction that we may pursue, if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons.\nUnder the NYSEs listing rules, shareholder approval would typically be required for our initial business combination if, for example:\nWe issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our ordinary shares then-outstanding (other than in a public offering);\nAny of our directors, officers or substantial shareholder (as defined by the NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or in the consideration to be paid in the transaction and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in issued and outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or\nThe issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.\nThe decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\nThe timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;\nThe expected cost of holding a shareholder vote;\nThe risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;\nOther time and budget constraints of the company; and\nAdditional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders.\nPermitted Purchases and Other Transactions with Respect to Our Securities\nIn the event we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or warrants in such transactions. If our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).\nIn the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules.\nThe purpose of any such transaction could be to (i) vote in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination, (ii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in\nconnection with our initial business combination or (iii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.\nIn addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.\nOur sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of tender offer or proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the general meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant and will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.\nOur sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. We expect any such purchases would be reported by such person pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.\nRedemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination\nWe will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account but net of taxes, if any, divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Further, we will not proceed with redeeming our public shares, even if a public shareholder has properly elected to redeem its shares, if a business combination does not close. Our sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by March 7, 2023 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares.\nLimitations on Redemptions\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SECs penny stock rules). However, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.\nManner of Conducting Redemptions\nWe will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would typically require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the NYSE, we will be required to comply with the NYSE rules.\nIf we hold a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination , we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:\nconduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and\nfile proxy materials with the SEC.\nIn the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.\nIf we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of a majority of the ordinary shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon and who vote at a general meeting. In such case, our sponsor and each member of our management team have agreed to vote their Founder Shares and public shares in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial purchasers Founder Shares, we would need 22,625,001, or 41.1%, of the 55,000,000 public shares sold in the Initial Public Offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. In addition, our sponsor and each member of our management team have\nentered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by March 7, 2023 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares.\nIf we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:\nconduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and\nfile tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.\nUpon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A ordinary shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.\nIn the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination.\nLimitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, which we refer to as Excess Shares, without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holders shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.\nHowever, we would not be restricting our shareholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.\nTendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights\nPublic shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Companys DWAC (Deposit/ Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holders option, in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.\nThere is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.\nThe foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an option window after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the companys shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become option rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholders election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.\nAny request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.\nIf our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata\nshare of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.\nIf our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering.\nRedemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that we will have only until March 7, 2023 to consummate an initial business combination. If we have not consummated an initial business combination by March 7, 2023, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account but net of taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to consummate an initial business combination by March 7, 2023. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law.\nOur sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any Founder Shares they hold if we fail to consummate an initial business combination by March 7, 2023 (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame).\nOur sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by March 7, 2023 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account but net of taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SECs penny stock rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person.\nWe expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $1,200,000 held outside the trust account plus\nup to $100,000 of funds from the trust account available to us to pay dissolution expenses, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.\nIf we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims.\nAlthough we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including, but not limited, to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. Seeking such waivers from third parties, including prospective business combination targets, may deter such parties from entering into agreements with us. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third-partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third-party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third-party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsors only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.\nIn the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our income tax obligations, and our sponsor asserts that it\nis unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per public share.\nWe will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to $1,200,000 following the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate, and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such shareholder. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $1,800,000, we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $1,800,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount.\nIf we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per public share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some, or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.\nOur public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by March 7, 2023, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by March 7, 2023 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. Public shareholders who redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not consummated an initial business combination by March 7, 2023, with respect to such Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a\nshareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholders voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholders redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote.\nComparison of Redemption or Purchase Prices in Connection with Our Initial Business Combination and If We Fail to Complete Our Initial Business Combination.\nThe following table compares the redemptions and other permitted purchases of public shares that may take place in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and if we have not consummated an initial business combination by March 7, 2023:\nRedemptions in\nConnection with Our\nInitial Business\nCombination\nOther Permitted\nPurchases of Public\nShares by Our\nAffiliates\nRedemptions if We\nFail to Complete an\nInitial Business\nCombination\nCalculation of redemption price\nRedemptions at the time of our initial business combination may be made pursuant to a tender offer or in connection with a shareholder vote. The redemption price will be the same whether we conduct redemptions pursuant to a tender offer or in connection with a shareholder vote. In either case, our public shareholders may redeem their public shares for cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination (which is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share), including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account but net of taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then- outstanding public shares, subject to the limitation that no redemptions will take\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit to the prices that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may pay in these transactions. If they engage in such transactions; they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a\nIf we have not consummated an initial business combination by March 7, 2023, we will redeem all public shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount, then on deposit in the trust account (which is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share), including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account but net of taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares.\nRedemptions in\nConnection with Our\nInitial Business\nCombination\nOther Permitted\nPurchases of Public\nShares by Our\nAffiliates\nRedemptions if We\nFail to Complete an\nInitial Business\nCombination\nplace if all of the redemptions would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and any limitations (including, but not limited, to cash requirements) agreed to in connection with the negotiation of terms of a proposed business combination.\ngoing-private transaction subject to the going- private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules.\nImpact to remaining shareholders\nThe redemptions in connection with our initial business combination will reduce the book value per share for our remaining shareholders, who will bear the burden of the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable.\nIf the permitted purchases described above are made, there would be no impact to our remaining shareholders because the purchase price would not be paid by us.\nThe redemption of our public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination will reduce the book value per share for the shares held by our sponsor, who will be our only remaining shareholder after such redemptions.\nCompetition\nIn identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.\nFacilities\nWe currently maintain our executive offices at 511 6th Ave #7342, New York, New York 10011. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.\nEmployees\nWe currently have two executive officers and one additional employee. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business\ncombination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition, financial results, and future growth prospects are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth below. The occurrence of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, financial results, and future growth prospects. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we do not currently believe to be material may also negatively affect our business, financial condition, financial results, and future growth prospects.\nFor Risk Factors related to the Business Combination, see our preliminary proxy statement contained in the Registration Statement, filed by Bullish with the SEC and, when available, our final proxy statement to be filed with the SEC.\nSummary Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the more significant risks relating to the Company.\nRisks Related to the Business Combination\nWe may not be able to complete the Business Combination pursuant to the BCA by December 31, 2022. If we are unable to do so, we will incur substantial costs associated with withdrawing from the transaction and may not be able to find additional sources of financing to cover those costs.\nIf the anticipated Business Combination with Bullish fails, it may be difficult to complete a business combination with a new prospective target business, negotiate and agree to a new business combination, and/or arrange for new sources of financing by March 7, 2023, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are a recently incorporated company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\nPast performance by our management team or their respective affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us.\nYour only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash.\nOur search for a business combination may be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the status of debt and equity markets.\nWe may not be able to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate, in which case our public shareholders may only receive $10.00 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, and our warrants will expire worthless.\nYou will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nThe NYSE may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nYou will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies.\nIf the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants not being held in the trust account are insufficient, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and our ability to complete our initial business combination, and we will depend on loans from our sponsor, its affiliates or members of our management team to fund our search and to complete our initial business combination.\nRisks Related to Our Trust Account\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.00 per public share.\nOur directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to satisfy indemnification claims of our directors and executive officers.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure\nWe may not hold an annual general meeting until after the consummation of our initial business combination.\nHolders of Class A ordinary shares will not be entitled to vote on any appointment of directors we hold prior to our initial business combination.\nRisks Related to Our Search for a Business Combination\nWe may face risks related to Fintech or related businesses.\nWe may seek acquisition opportunities in industries or sectors which may or may not be outside of our managements area of expertise.\nWe may be a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. investors.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Documents and Structure\nIn order to effectuate an initial business combination, blank check companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and other governing instruments, including their warrant\nagreements. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or governing instruments in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete our initial business combination that our shareholders may not support.\nRisks Related to Our Warrants\nOur warrant agreement will designate the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company\nGeneral Risks\nWe are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nRisks Associated with Acquiring and Operating a Business in Foreign Countries\nIf we pursue a target company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we may face additional burdens in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing such initial business combination, and if we effect such initial business combination, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations.\nRisks Related to the Business Combination\nWe may not be able to complete the Business Combination pursuant to the BCA. If we are unable to do so, we will incur substantial costs associated with withdrawing from the transaction and may not be able to find additional sources of financing to cover those costs.\nIn connection with the BCA, we have incurred substantial costs researching, planning and negotiating the transaction. These costs include, but are not limited to, costs associated with securing sources of debt financing, costs associated with employing and retaining third-party advisors who performed the financial, auditing and legal services required to complete the transaction, and the expenses generated by our officers, executives, managers and employees in connection with the transaction. If, for whatever reason, the transactions contemplated by the BCA fail to close, we will be responsible for these costs, but will have no source of revenue with which to pay them. We may need to obtain additional sources of financing in order to meet our obligations, which we may not be able to secure on the same terms as our existing financing or at all. If we are unable to secure new sources of financing and do not have sufficient funds to meet our obligations, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account.\nIf the anticipated Business Combination with Bullish fails, it may be difficult to complete a business combination with a new prospective target business, negotiate and agree to a new business combination, and/or arrange for new sources of financing by March 7, 2023, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate.\nFinding, researching, analyzing and negotiating with Bullish took a substantial amount of time and effort, and if the Business Combination with Bullish fails for any reason, we may not be able to find, research, negotiate and agree to terms with, and/or arrange for new sources of financing for a business combination with, a new\nprospective target business by March 7, 2023 (27 months after the closing of our Initial Public Offering), in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are a recently incorporated company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\nWe are a recently incorporated company, incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands with operations limited to pursuing and reviewing potential opportunities for the initial business combination since the Initial Public Offering. Because we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of completing our initial business combination with one or more target businesses. We have no plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective target business concerning a business combination and may be unable to complete our initial business combination. If we fail to complete our initial business combination, we will never generate any operating revenues.\nPast performance by our management team or their respective affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us.\nInformation regarding performance is presented for informational purposes only. Any past experience or performance of our management team and their respective affiliates is not a guarantee of either (i) our ability to successfully identify and execute a transaction or (ii) success with respect to any business combination that we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our management team or their respective affiliates as indicative of the future performance of an investment in us or the returns we will, or are likely to, generate going forward.\nOur shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our shareholders do not support such a combination.\nWe may choose not to hold a shareholder vote before we complete our initial business combination if the business combination would not require shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements. For instance, if we were seeking to acquire a target business where the consideration, we were paying in the transaction was all cash, we would typically not be required to seek shareholder approval to complete such a transaction. Except as required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, the decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. Accordingly, we may complete our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares do not approve of the business combination we complete.\nYour only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash.\nAt the time of your investment in us, you will not be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any target businesses. If our board of directors determines to complete a business combination without seeking shareholder approval, your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to exercising your redemption rights within the period of time (which will be at least 20 business days) set forth in our tender offer documents mailed to our public shareholders in which we describe our initial business combination.\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor and members of our management team have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public shareholders vote.\nOur sponsor and members of our management team own 15.1% of our outstanding ordinary shares since the completion of the Initial Public Offering. Our sponsor and members of our management team also may from time to time purchase Class A ordinary shares prior to our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that, if we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of a majority of the ordinary shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon and who vote at a general meeting. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders Founder Shares, we would need 22,625,001, or 41.1% of the 55,000,000 public shares sold in the Initial Public Offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved. Accordingly, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, the agreement by our sponsor and each member of our management team to vote in favor of our initial business combination will increase the likelihood that we will receive the requisite shareholder approval for such initial business combination.\nThe ability of our public shareholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target.\nWe may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SECs penny stock rules). Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us.\nThe ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.\nAt the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination, we will not know how many shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account to meet such requirements or arrange for third party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares are submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for third party financing. Raising additional third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. In addition, the amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriters will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with an initial business combination. The per share amount we will distribute to shareholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the amount held in trust will continue to reflect our obligation to pay the entire deferred underwriting commissions. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure\nThe ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your shares.\nIf our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful is increased. If our initial business combination is unsuccessful, you would not receive your pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account until we liquidate the trust account. If you are in need of immediate liquidity, you could attempt to sell your shares in the open market; however, at such time our shares may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the trust account. In either situation, you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate, or you are able to sell your shares in the open market.\nThe requirement that we complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating our initial business combination and may decrease our ability to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular, as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our public shareholders.\nAny potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning our initial business combination will be aware that we must complete our initial business combination by March 7, 2023. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating an initial business combination, knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the timeframe described above. In addition, we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial business combination on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive investigation.\nWe may not be able to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate, in which case our public shareholders may only receive $10.00 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, and our warrants will expire worthless.\nWe may not be able to find a suitable target business and consummate an initial business combination by March 7, 2023. Our ability to complete our initial business combination may be negatively impacted by general market conditions, volatility in the capital and debt markets and the other risks described herein. If we have not consummated an initial business combination within such applicable time period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account but net of taxes payable, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law. In either such case, our public shareholders may receive only $10.00 per public share, or less than $10.00 per public share, on the redemption of their shares, and our warrants will expire worthless.\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase public shares or warrants, which may influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public float of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants.\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination, although they are under no obligation to do so. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or warrants in such transactions.\nIn the event that our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The purpose of any such transaction could be to (1) vote in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination, (2) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (3) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.\nIf a shareholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial business combination or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed.\nWe will comply with the proxy rules or tender offer rules, as applicable, when conducting redemptions in connection with our initial business combination. Despite our compliance with these rules, if a shareholder fails to receive our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, such shareholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares. In addition, the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly redeem or tender public shares. In the event that a shareholder fails to comply with these procedures, its shares may not be redeemed.\nYou will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\nOur public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business combination, and then only in connection with those Class A ordinary shares that such shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business\ncombination by March 7, 2023 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business by March 7, 2023, subject to applicable law and as further described herein. Public shareholders who redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not consummated an initial business combination by March 7, 2023, with respect to such Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind in the trust account. Holders of warrants will not have any right to the proceeds held in the trust account with respect to the warrants. Accordingly, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nThe NYSE may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur Class A ordinary shares and public warrants are listed separately on the NYSE. We cannot assure you that our securities will continue to be listed on the NYSE in the future or prior to our initial business combination. In order to continue listing our securities on the NYSE prior to our initial business combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and stock price levels. Generally, we must maintain a minimum amount in shareholders equity (generally $2,500,000) and a minimum number of holders of our securities (generally 300 public holders). Additionally, in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with the NYSEs initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than the NYSEs continued listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on the NYSE. For instance, our stock price would generally be required to be at least $4.00 per share, our shareholders equity would generally be required to be at least $5.0 million and we would be required to have a minimum of 300 round lot holders of our securities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time.\nIf the NYSE delists any of our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect such securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\nreduced liquidity for our securities;\na determination that our Class A ordinary shares are a penny stock which will require brokers trading in our Class A ordinary shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. Because we expect that our units and eventually our Class A ordinary shares and warrants will be listed on the NYSE, our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants will qualify as covered securities under the statute. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of covered securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the State of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their\nstates. Further, if we were no longer listed on the NYSE, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under the statute, and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nYou will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies.\nSince the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants are intended to be used to complete an initial business combination with a target business that has not been selected, we may be deemed to be a blank check company under the United States securities laws. However, because we have net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000 and have filed a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. Among other things, this means our units will be immediately tradable and we will have a longer period of time to complete our initial business combination than do companies subject to Rule 419. Moreover, if we are subject to Rule 419, that rule would prohibit the release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust account to us unless and until the funds in the trust account were released to us in connection with our completion of an initial business combination.\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if you or a group of shareholders are deemed to hold in excess of 15% of our Class A ordinary shares, you will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 15% of our Class A ordinary shares.\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that a public shareholder will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to Excess Shares. However, we would not be restricting our public shareholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Your inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce your influence over our ability to complete our initial business combination and you could suffer a material loss on your investment in us if you sell Excess Shares in open market transactions. Additionally, you will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And as a result, you will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 15% and, in order to dispose of such shares, would be required to sell your stock in open market transactions, potentially at a loss.\nBecause of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.\nWe expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do, and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our public shares the right to redeem their\nshares for cash at the time of our initial business combination in conjunction with a shareholder vote or via a tender offer. Target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.\nIf the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants not being held in the trust account are insufficient, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and our ability to complete our initial business combination, and we will depend on loans from our sponsor, its affiliates or members of our management team to fund our search and to complete our initial business combination.\nOf the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, only approximately $1.2 million is currently available to us outside the trust account to fund our working capital requirements. If we are required to seek additional capital, we would need to borrow funds from our sponsor, management team or other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate. None of our sponsor, members of our management team nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to us in such circumstances. Any such advances would be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our Initial Business Combination. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. If we are unable to obtain these loans, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. Consequently, our public shareholders may only receive approximately $10.00 per share on our redemption of our public shares, and our warrants will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public shareholders may receive less than $10.00 per share on the redemption of their shares. See -If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.00 per share and other risk factors below.\nSubsequent to our completion of our initial business combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our securities, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nEven if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will identify all material issues with a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing. Accordingly, any holders who choose to retain their securities following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.\nRisks Related to Our Trust Account\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.00 per public share.\nOur placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from third-party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements, they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. Seeking such waivers from third parties, including prospective business combination targets, may deter such parties from entering into agreements with us. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative.\nExamples of possible instances where we may engage a third-party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we have not consummated an initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the ten years following redemption. Accordingly, due to the claims of such creditors, the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders could be less than the $10.00 per public share initially held in the trust account. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third-party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.\nHowever, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsors only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.\nOur directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders.\nIn the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders may be reduced below $10.00 per public share.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to satisfy indemnification claims of our directors and executive officers.\nWe have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, our officers and directors have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the trust account and to not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason whatsoever (except to the extent they are entitled to funds from the trust account due to their ownership of public shares). Accordingly, any indemnification provided will be able to be satisfied by us only if (i) we have sufficient funds outside of the trust account or (ii) we consummate an initial business combination. Our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders. Furthermore, a shareholders investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.\nThe securities in which we invest the funds held in the trust account could bear a negative rate of interest, which could reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders may be less than $10.00 per share.\nThe proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. While short-term U.S. government treasury obligations currently yield a positive rate of interest, they have briefly yielded negative interest rates in recent years. Central banks in Europe and Japan pursued interest rates below zero in recent years, and the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve has not ruled out the possibility that it may in the future adopt similar policies in the United States. In the event that we are unable to complete our initial business combination or make certain amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, our public shareholders are entitled to receive their pro-rata share of the proceeds held in the trust account, plus any interest income, net of income taxes paid or payable (less, in the case we are unable to complete our initial business combination, $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses). Negative interest rates could reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders may be less than $10.00 per share.\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy or insolvency court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages.\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors.\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our shareholders and the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities may be restricted, including:\nrestrictions on the nature of our investments; and\nrestrictions on the issuance of securities,\neach of which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. In addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including:\nregistration as an investment company with the SEC;\nadoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\nreporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations that we are currently not subject to.\nIn order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading of securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading investment securities constituting more than 40% of our assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business will be to identify and complete a business combination and\nthereafter to operate the post-transaction business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor.\nWe do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the trust account may only be invested in United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. An investment in us is not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment securities. The trust account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of either: (i) the completion of our initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by March 7, 2023 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares; or (iii) absent our completing an initial business combination by March 7, 2023, our return of the funds held in the trust account to our public shareholders as part of our redemption of the public shares. If we do not invest the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete a business combination. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements, including amended rules and regulations applicable to special purpose acquisition companies like us that have been proposed by the SEC and may be adopted in their proposed or an amended form. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations.\nIf we have not consummated an initial business combination the prescribed timeframe, our public shareholders may be forced to wait beyond the prescribed timeframe before redemption from our trust account.\nIf we have not consummated an initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe, the proceeds then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account but net of taxes payable, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares, as further described herein. Any redemption of public shareholders from the trust account\nwill be effected automatically by function of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association prior to any voluntary winding up. If we are required to wind up, liquidate the trust account and distribute such amount therein, pro rata, to our public shareholders, as part of any liquidation process, such winding up, liquidation and distribution must comply with the applicable provisions of the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands, as amended (the Companies Law). In that case, investors may be forced to wait beyond the prescribed timeframe before the redemption proceeds of our trust account become available to them, and they receive the return of their pro rata portion of the proceeds from our trust account. We have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to the date of our redemption or liquidation unless, prior thereto, we consummate our initial business combination or amend certain provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, and only then in cases where investors have sought to redeem their Class A ordinary shares. Only upon our redemption or any liquidation will public shareholders be entitled to distributions if we do not complete our initial business combination and do not amend certain provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law.\nOur shareholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares.\nIf we are forced to enter into an insolvent liquidation, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed as an unlawful payment if it was proved that immediately following the date on which the distribution was made, we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. As a result, a liquidator could seek to recover some, or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to us or our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing themselves and our company to claims, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. We and our directors and officers who knowingly and willfully authorized or permitted any distribution to be paid out of our share premium account while we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business would be guilty of an offence and may be liable for a fine of approximately $18,300.00 and imprisonment for five years in the Cayman Islands.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure\nWe may not hold an annual general meeting until after the consummation of our initial business combination.\nIn accordance with the NYSE corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual general meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on the NYSE. There is no requirement under the Companies Law for us to hold annual or extraordinary general meetings to appoint directors. Until we hold an annual general meeting, public shareholders may not be afforded the opportunity to appoint directors and to discuss company affairs with management. Our board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being appointed in each year and each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual general meeting) serving a three-year term.\nHolders of Class A ordinary shares will not be entitled to vote on any appointment of directors we hold prior to our initial business combination.\nPrior to our initial business combination, only holders of our Founder Shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors. Holders of our public shares will not be entitled to vote on the appointment of directors during such time. In addition, prior to our initial business combination, holders of a majority of our Founder Shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. Accordingly, you may not have any say in the management of our company prior to the consummation of an initial business combination.\nWe are not registering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time, and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants except on a cashless basis and potentially causing such warrants to expire worthless.\nWe are not registering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time. However, under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed that, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days after the closing of our initial business combination, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the issuance of such shares, and we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause the same to become effective within 60 business days after the closing of our initial business combination and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current, complete or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act in accordance with the above requirements, we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, in which case, the number of Class A ordinary shares that you will receive upon cashless exercise will be based on a formula subject to a maximum number of shares equal to 0.361 Class A ordinary shares per warrant (subject to adjustment). However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available. Notwithstanding the above, if our Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. Exercising the warrants on a cashless basis could have the effect of reducing the potential upside of the holders investment in our company because the warrant holder will hold a smaller number of Class A ordinary shares upon a cashless exercise of the warrants they hold. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws and no exemption is available. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the Class A ordinary shares included in the units. There may be a circumstance where an exemption from registration exists for holders of our private placement warrants to exercise their warrants while a corresponding exemption does not exist for holders of the public warrants included as part of units sold in the Initial Public Offering. In such an instance, our sponsor, Anchor Investor and their permitted transferees (which may include our directors and executive officers) would be able to exercise their warrants and sell the ordinary shares underlying their warrants while holders of our public warrants would not be able to exercise their warrants and sell the underlying ordinary shares. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying Class A ordinary shares for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the warrants as set forth above even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise their warrants.\nThe warrants may become exercisable and redeemable for a security other than the Class A ordinary shares, and you will not have any information regarding such other security at this time.\nIn certain situations, including if we are not the surviving entity in our initial business combination, the warrants may become exercisable for a security other than the Class A ordinary shares. As a result, if the surviving\ncompany redeems your warrants for securities pursuant to the warrant agreement, you may receive a security in a company of which you do not have information at this time. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, the surviving company will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to register the issuance of the security underlying the warrants within 20 business days of the closing of an initial business combination.\nThe grant of registration rights to our sponsor, our Anchor Investor and directors may make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination, and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of our Class A ordinary shares.\nPursuant to an agreement to be entered into concurrently with the Initial Public Offering, our sponsor, our Anchor Investor, directors and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the resale of the Class A ordinary shares into which Founder Shares are convertible, the private placement warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants, and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of such warrants. The registration rights will be exercisable with respect to the Founder Shares and the private placement warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such private placement warrants. We will bear the cost of registering these securities. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the shareholders of the target business may increase the equity stake, they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our securities that is expected when the securities owned by our sponsor, Anchor Investor or their permitted transferees are registered for resale.\nRisks Related to Our Search for a Business Combination in the Event we pursue an Alternative Business Transaction\nWe may face risks related to Fintech or related businesses.\nBusiness combinations with Fintech or related businesses may involve special considerations and risks. If we complete our initial business combination with a Fintech or related business, we will be subject to the following risks, any of which could be detrimental to us and the business we acquire:\nIf the company or business we acquire provides products or services which relate to the facilitation of financial transactions, such as funds or securities settlement system, and such product or service fails or is compromised, we may be subject to claims from both the firms to whom we provide our products and services and the clients they serve;\nIf we are unable to keep pace with evolving technology and changes in the financial services industry our revenues and future prospects may decline;\nOur ability to provide Fintech or related products and services to customers may be reduced or eliminated by legal or regulatory changes;\nAny business or company we acquire could be vulnerable to cyberattack or theft of individual identities or personal data;\nDifficulties with any products or services we provide could damage our reputation and business;\nA failure to comply with privacy and other laws and regulations to which we may be subject could adversely affect relations with customers and have a negative impact on business;\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property and we may be subject to infringement claims.\nAny of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our operations following a business combination. However, our efforts in identifying prospective target businesses will not be limited to Fintech or related\nbusinesses. Accordingly, if we acquire a target business in another industry, these risks will likely not affect us and we will be subject to other risks attendant with the specific industry in which we operate or target business which we acquire, none of which can be presently ascertained.\nBecause we are neither limited to evaluating a target business in a particular industry sector nor have we selected any specific target businesses with which to pursue our initial business combination, you will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target businesss operations.\nWe may pursue business combination opportunities in any sector, except that we will not, under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination solely with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. Because we have not yet selected or approached any specific target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target businesss operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition or prospects. To the extent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any holders who choose to retain their securities following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.\nWe may seek acquisition opportunities in industries or sectors which may or may not be outside of our managements area of expertise.\nWe will consider a business combination outside of our managements area of expertise if a business combination target is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive acquisition opportunity for our company. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular business combination target, we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to investors than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in a business combination target. In the event we elect to pursue an acquisition outside of the areas of our managements expertise, our managements expertise may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained in this Form 10-K regarding the areas of our managements expertise would not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire. As a result, our management may not be able to adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. Accordingly, any holders who choose to retain their securities following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.\nAlthough we have identified general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines, and as a result, the target business with which we enter into our initial business combination may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines.\nAlthough we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our initial business combination will not have all of these positive attributes. If we complete our initial business combination with a target that does not meet some or all of\nthese guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does meet all of our general criteria and guidelines. In addition, if we announce a prospective business combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and guidelines, a greater number of shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. In addition, if shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain shareholder approval of our initial business combination if the target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.\nWe are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent accounting or investment banking firm, and consequently, you may have no assurance from an independent source that the price we are paying for the business is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view.\nUnless we complete our initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that the price we are paying is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our shareholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination.\nWe may issue additional Class A ordinary shares or preference shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our shareholders and likely present other risks.\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will authorize the issuance of up to 500,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, 50,000,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, and 5,000,000 preference shares, par value $0.0001 per share. As of September 30, 2021, there was 440,000,000 and 40,250,000 authorized but unissued Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares, respectively, available for issuance which amount does not take into account shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants or shares issuable upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares, if any. The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares (which such Class A ordinary shares delivered upon conversion will not have any redemption rights or be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account if we fail to consummate an initial business combination) at the time of our initial business combination or earlier at the option of the holders thereof as described herein and in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. As of September 30, 2021, there was no preference shares issued and outstanding.\nWe may issue a substantial number of additional Class A ordinary shares or preference shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination. We may also issue Class A ordinary shares in connection with our redeeming the warrants as described in Description of Securities-Warrants-Public Shareholders Warrants or upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares on a share-for-share basis at the time of our initial business combination. However, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide, among other things, that prior to or in connection with our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination or on any other proposal presented to shareholders prior to or in connection with the completion of an initial business combination. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all\nprovisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote. The issuance of additional ordinary or preference shares:\nmay significantly dilute the equity interest of our shareholders;\nmay subordinate the rights of holders of Class A ordinary shares if preference shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our Class A ordinary shares;\ncould cause a change in control if a substantial number of Class A ordinary shares are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors;\nmay have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us;\nmay adversely affect prevailing market prices for our units, Class A ordinary shares and/or warrants; and\nmay not result in adjustment to the exercise price of our warrants.\nResources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.\nWe anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide not to complete a specific initial business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete our initial business combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.\nWe may be a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. investors.\nIf we are a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants, the U.S. Holder may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences and may be subject to additional reporting requirements. Our PFIC status for our current and subsequent taxable years may depend on whether we qualify for the PFIC start-up. Depending on the particular circumstances the application of the start-up exception may be subject to uncertainty, and there cannot be any assurance that we will qualify for the start-up exception. Accordingly, there can be no assurances with respect to our status as a PFIC for our current taxable year or any subsequent taxable year. Our actual PFIC status for any taxable year, however, will not be determinable until after the end of such taxable year. Moreover, if we determine we are a PFIC for any taxable year, upon written request, we will endeavor to provide to a U.S. Holder such information as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may require, including a PFIC Annual Information Statement, in order to enable the U.S. Holder to make and maintain a qualified electing fund election, but there can be no assurance that we will timely provide such required information, and such election would be unavailable with respect to our warrants in all cases. We urge U.S. investors to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible application of the PFIC rules.\nWe may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination and such reincorporation may result in taxes imposed on shareholders or warrant holders.\nWe may, in connection with our initial business combination and subject to requisite shareholder approval under the Companies Law, reincorporate in the jurisdiction in which the target company or business is located or in another jurisdiction. The transaction may require a shareholder or warrant holder to recognize taxable income in the jurisdiction in which the shareholder or warrant holder is a tax resident or in which its members are resident if it is a tax transparent entity. We do not intend to make any cash distributions to shareholders or warrant holders to pay such taxes. Shareholders or warrant holders may be subject to withholding taxes or other taxes, or other adverse tax consequences, with respect to their ownership of us after the reincorporation.\nAfter our initial business combination, it is possible that a majority of our directors and officers will live outside the United States and all of our assets will be located outside the United States; therefore, investors may not be able to enforce federal securities laws or their other legal rights.\nIt is possible that after our initial business combination, a majority of our directors and officers will reside outside of the United States and all of our assets will be located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult, or in some cases not possible, for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon all of our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties on our directors and officers under United States laws.\nWe are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their loss could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nOur operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, our executive officers and directors. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our officers and directors, at least until we have completed our initial business combination. In addition, our executive officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating their time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. We do not have an employment agreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our directors or executive officers.\nThe unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or executive officers could have a detrimental effect on us.\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following our initial business combination. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business.\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. The role of our key personnel in the target business, however, cannot presently be ascertained. Although some of our key personnel may remain with the target business in senior management, director or advisory positions following our initial business combination, it is likely that some or all of the management of the target business will remain in place. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our initial business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements.\nOur key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination, and a particular business combination may be conditioned on the retention or resignation of such key personnel. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our initial business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.\nOur key personnel may be able to remain with our company after the completion of our initial business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to us after the completion of the business combination. Such negotiations also could make such key personnels retention or resignation a condition to any such agreement. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business.\nWe may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may affect our initial business combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company.\nWhen evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target businesss management may be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target businesss management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected. Should the target businesss management not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations and profitability of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted. Accordingly, any holders who choose to retain their securities following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.\nThe officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our initial business combination. The loss of a business combination targets key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business.\nThe role of an acquisition candidates key personnel upon the completion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidates management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our initial business combination, it is possible that members of the management of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place, which could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business.\nOur executive officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination.\nOur executive officers and directors are not required to, and will not, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search for a business combination and their other businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Each of our executive officers is engaged in several other business endeavors for which he may be entitled to substantial compensation, and our executive officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs. Our independent directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities. If our executive officers and directors other business affairs require them to devote substantial amounts of time to such affairs in excess of their current commitment levels, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs which may have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination.\nOur officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, including another blank check company, and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\nUntil we consummate our initial business combination, we intend to engage in the business of identifying and combining with one or more businesses or entities. Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law.\nIn addition, our sponsor, officers and directors may in the future become affiliated with other blank check companies that may have acquisition objectives that are similar to ours. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to such other blank check companies prior to its presentation to us, subject to our officers and directors fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other.\nOur executive officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests.\nWe have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, executive officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. In fact, we may enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor, our directors or executive officers, although we do not intend to do so. Nor do we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours.\nThe personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a business combination. Consequently, our directors and officers discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our shareholders best interest. If this were the case, it would be a breach of their fiduciary duties to us as a matter of Cayman Islands law and we or our shareholders might have a claim against such individuals for infringing on our shareholders rights. However, we might not ultimately be successful in any claim we may make against them for such reason.\nWe may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers, directors or initial shareholders which may raise potential conflicts of interest.\nIn light of the involvement of our sponsor, executive officers and directors with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers, directors or initial shareholders. Our directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities, including, without limitation, those\ndescribed under Management-Conflicts of Interest. Our sponsor, officers and directors may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Such entities may compete with us for business combination opportunities. Our sponsor, officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our initial business combination with any entities with which they are affiliated, and there have been no substantive discussions concerning a business combination with any such entity or entities. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria and guidelines for a business combination and such transaction was approved by a majority of our independent and disinterested directors. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions regarding the fairness to our company from a financial point of view of a business combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers, directors or initial shareholders, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public shareholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest.\nSince our sponsor, our executive officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination.\nThe sponsor currently owns 9,540,000 Founder Shares, (of which the sponsor has agreed to sell an aggregate of 1,950,000 shares to our Anchor Investor upon completion of the initial business combination) and the independent directors each received 70,000 Founder Shares concurrently with the Initial Public Offering. The Founder Shares will be worthless if we do not consummate the initial business combination. Our sponsor and our Anchor Investor have each purchased 3,500,000 Private Placement Warrants (7,000,000 in the aggregate) for an aggregate purchase price of $10.5 million. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to the Founder Shares or Private Placement Warrants, which will expire worthless if we do not consummate a business combination prior to March 7, 2023. As a result, the personal and financial interests of certain of our officers and directors, directly or as members of our sponsor, in consummating the initial business combination, may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target for the initial business combination. Consequently, the discretion of our officers and directors, in identifying and selecting a suitable target business combination may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of the initial business combination are appropriate and in the best interest of public shareholders.\nWe may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a business combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our shareholders investment in us.\nAlthough we have no commitments as of the date of this Form 10-K to issue any notes or other debt securities, or to otherwise incur outstanding debt following the Initial Public Offering, we may choose to incur substantial debt to complete our initial business combination. We and our officers have agreed that we will not incur any indebtedness unless we have obtained from the lender a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to the monies held in the trust account. As such, no issuance of debt will affect the per-share amount available for redemption from the trust account. Nevertheless, the incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:\ndefault and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;\nacceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\nour immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand;\nour inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt is outstanding;\nour inability to pay dividends on our Class A ordinary shares;\nusing a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Class A ordinary shares if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\nlimitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;\nincreased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and\nlimitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.\nWe may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services. This lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations and profitability.\nOf the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants up to $535,762,500 will be available to complete our initial business combination (after taking into account the $15,437,500 of deferred underwriting commissions being held in the trust account and the estimated non-reimbursed expenses of the Initial Public Offering).\nWe may effectuate our initial business combination with a single-target business or multiple-target businesses simultaneously or within a short period of time. However, we may not be able to effectuate our initial business combination with more than one target business because of various factors, including the existence of complex accounting issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with the SEC that present operating results and the financial condition of several target businesses as if they had been operated on a combined basis. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be:\nsolely dependent upon the performance of a single business, property or asset; or\ndependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.\nThis lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination.\nWe may attempt to complete our initial business combination with a private company about which little information is available, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.\nIn pursuing our acquisition strategy, we may seek to effectuate our initial business combination with a privately held company. Very little public information generally exists about private companies, and we could be required\nto make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination on the basis of limited information, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.\nOur management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. Upon the loss of control of a target business, new management may not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business.\nWe may structure our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-business combination company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new Class A ordinary shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new Class A ordinary shares, our shareholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding Class A ordinary shares subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority shareholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the companys shares than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain control of the target business. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management would possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business.\nWe may seek business combination opportunities with a high degree of complexity that require significant operational improvements, which could delay or prevent us from achieving our desired results.\nWe may seek business combination opportunities with large, highly complex companies that we believe would benefit from operational improvements. While we intend to implement such improvements, to the extent that our efforts are delayed or we are unable to achieve the desired improvements, the business combination may not be as successful as we anticipate.\nTo the extent we complete our initial business combination with a large complex business or entity with a complex operating structure, we may also be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business with which we combine, which could delay or prevent us from implementing our strategy. Although our management team will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business and its operations, we may not be able to properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors until we complete our business combination. If we are not able to achieve our desired operational improvements, or the improvements take longer to implement than anticipated, we may not achieve the gains that we anticipate. Furthermore, some of these risks and complexities may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks and complexities will adversely impact a target business. Such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a smaller, less complex organization.\nWe do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to complete our initial business combination with which a substantial majority of our shareholders do not agree.\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold, except that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause\nour net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SECs penny stock rules). As a result, we may be able to complete our initial business combination even though a substantial majority of our public shareholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares or, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Documents and Structure\nIn order to effectuate an initial business combination, blank check companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and other governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or governing instruments in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete our initial business combination that our shareholders may not support.\nIn order to effectuate a business combination, blank check companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. For example, blank check companies have amended the definition of business combination, increased redemption thresholds, extended the time to consummate an initial business combination and, with respect to their warrants, amended their warrant agreements to require the warrants to be exchanged for cash and/or other securities. Amending our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will require at least a special resolution of our shareholders as a matter of Cayman Islands law, meaning the approval of holders of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company, and amending our warrant agreement will require a vote of holders of at least 65% of the public warrants and, solely with respect to any amendment to the terms of the private placement warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the private placement warrants, 65% of the number of the then outstanding private placement warrants. In addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will require us to provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash if we propose an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by March 7, 2023 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. To the extent any of such amendments would be deemed to fundamentally change the nature of any of the securities offered through this registration statement, we would register, or seek an exemption from registration for, the affected securities.\nThe provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that relate to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares may be amended with the approval of a resolution passed by at least two-thirds of the votes cast at a separate meeting of the holders of the issued shares of that class, and the corresponding provisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended with the approval of the holders of 65% of our outstanding ordinary shares who attend a meeting called for the purpose of such amendment, which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other blank check companies. It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to facilitate the completion of an initial business combination that some of our shareholders may not support.\nSome other blank check companies have a provision in their charter which prohibits the amendment of certain of its provisions, including those which relate to the rights of a companys shareholders, without approval by a\ncertain percentage of the companys shareholders. In those companies, amendment of these provisions typically requires approval by between 90% and 100% of the companys shareholders. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that any of its provisions related to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares (including the requirement to deposit proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the private placement of warrants into the trust account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances, and to provide redemption rights to public shareholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by a resolution passed by at least two-thirds of the votes cast at a separate meeting of the holders of the issued shares of that class, and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended if approved by holders of at least 65% of our ordinary shares present at a meeting called to consider such amendment; provided that the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association governing the appointment or removal of directors prior to our initial business combination may only be amended by a special resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at our general meeting which shall include the affirmative vote of a simple majority of our Class B ordinary shares. Our sponsor and its permitted transferees, if any, who collectively beneficially own 14% of our Class A ordinary shares, will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. As a result, we may be able to amend the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association which govern our pre-business combination behavior more easily than some other blank check companies, and this may increase our ability to complete a business combination with which you do not agree. Our shareholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association.\nOur sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to agreements with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by March 7, 2023 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account but net of taxes payable, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares. Our shareholders are not parties to, or third-party beneficiaries of, these agreements and, as a result, will not have the ability to pursue remedies against our sponsor, executive officers, directors or director nominees for any breach of these agreements. As a result, in the event of a breach, our shareholders would need to pursue a shareholder derivative action, subject to applicable law.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination or to fund the operations and growth of a target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.\nAlthough we believe that the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will be sufficient to allow us to complete our initial business combination, because we have not yet selected any prospective target business we cannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction. If the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants prove to be insufficient, either because of the size of our initial business combination, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business, the obligation to redeem for cash a significant number of shares from shareholders who elect redemption in connection with our initial business combination or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase shares in connection with our initial business combination, we may be required to seek additional financing or to abandon the proposed business combination. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The current economic environment may make it difficult for\ncompanies to obtain acquisition financing. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to complete our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. In addition, even if we do not need additional financing to complete our initial business combination, we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or shareholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination.\nOur sponsor controls a substantial interest in us and thus may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support.\nOur sponsor currently owns 13.7% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares. Accordingly, it may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Neither our sponsor nor, to our knowledge, any of our officers or directors, have any current intention to purchase additional securities. Factors that would be considered in making such additional purchases would include consideration of the current trading price of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, our board of directors, whose members were appointed by our sponsor, is and will be divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being appointed in each year. We may not hold an annual general meeting to appoint new directors prior to the completion of our initial business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the completion of the business combination. If there is an annual general meeting, as a consequence of our staggered board of directors, only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for appointment and our sponsor, because of its ownership position, will control the outcome, as only holders of our Class B ordinary shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors and to remove directors prior to our initial business combination. Accordingly, our sponsor will continue to exert control at least until the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor.\nRisks Related to Our Warrants\nOur warrant agreement will designate the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company.\nOur warrant agreement will provide that, subject to applicable law, (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement, including under the Securities Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. We will waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the warrant agreement will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our warrant agreement. If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions of the warrant agreement, is filed in a court other than a court of the State of New York or the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York (a foreign action) in the name of any holder of our warrants, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of New York in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an enforcement action), and (y) having service of process made upon such warrant holder in any such enforcement action by service upon such warrant holders counsel in the foreign action as agent for such warrant holder.\nThis choice-of-forum provision may limit a warrant holders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with our company, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our warrant agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.\nWe may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem the outstanding public warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading Description of Securities-Warrants-Public Shareholders Warrants-Anti-Dilution Adjustments) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption and provided that certain other conditions are met. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the warrants as set forth above even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise the warrants. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you to (i) exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, we expect would be substantially less than the market value of your warrants.\nIn addition, we have the ability to redeem the outstanding public warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption provided that the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading Description of Securities-Warrants-Public Shareholders Warrants-Anti-Dilution Adjustments) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption and provided that certain other conditions are met, including that holders will be able to exercise their warrants prior to redemption for a number of Class A ordinary shares determined based on the redemption date and the fair market value of our Class A ordinary shares. The value received upon exercise of the warrants (1) may be less than the value the holders would have received if they had exercised their warrants at a later time where the underlying share price is higher and (2) may not compensate the holders for the value of the warrants, including because the number of ordinary shares received is capped at 0.361 Class A ordinary shares per warrant (subject to adjustment) irrespective of the remaining life of the warrants.\nNone of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by our sponsor, our Anchor Investor or their permitted transferees.\nOur warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares and make it more difficult to effectuate our initial business combination.\nWe issued warrants to purchase 20,000,000 of our Class A ordinary shares as part of the units offered and, simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we issued in a private placement an aggregate of 7,000,000 private placement warrants each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. In addition, if the sponsor, its affiliates or a member of our management team makes any working capital loans, it may convert up to $1,500,000 of such loans into up to an additional 1,000,000 private placement warrants, at the price of $1.50 per warrant. We may also issue Class A ordinary shares in connection with our redemption of our warrants.\nTo the extent we issue ordinary shares for any reason, including to effectuate a business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional Class A ordinary shares upon exercise of these warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business. Such warrants, when exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares and reduce the value of the Class A ordinary shares issued to complete the business transaction. Therefore, our warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business transaction or increase the cost of acquiring the target business.\nBecause each unit contains one-third of one redeemable warrant and only a whole warrant may be exercised, the units may be worth less than units of other blank check companies.\nEach unit contains one-third of one redeemable warrant. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, no fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units, and only whole units will trade. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of Class A ordinary shares to be issued to the warrant holder. This is different from other offerings similar to ours whose units include one ordinary share and one whole warrant to purchase one whole share. We have established the components of the units in this way in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of a business combination since the warrants will be exercisable in the aggregate for one-third of the number of shares compared to units that each contain a whole warrant to purchase one whole share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive merger partner for target businesses. Nevertheless, this unit structure may cause our units to be worth less than if a unit included a warrant to purchase one whole share.\nA provision of our warrant agreement may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination.\nUnlike most blank check companies, if (i) we issue additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of our initial business combination at a Newly Issued Price (defined as the price at which Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities are issued for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of a Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per Class A ordinary share) of less than $9.20 per ordinary share, (ii) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the consummation of our initial business combination (net of redemptions), and (iii) the Market Value (defined as the volume weighted average trading price of its Class A ordinary shares during the 20 trading day period) is below $9.20 per share, then the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger prices described below under Description of Securities-Warrants-Public Shareholders Warrants-Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00 and Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00 will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $10.00 per share redemption trigger price described below under Description of Securities-Warrants-Public Shareholders Warrants-Redemption of warrants when the price per\nClass A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00 will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. This may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business.\nGeneral Risks\nWe are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class A ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any March 31st before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following September 30. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nAdditionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior March 31st, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior March 31st. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.\nCompliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it more difficult for us to effectuate a business combination, require substantial financial and management resources, and increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending September 30, 2022. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target business with which we seek to complete our initial business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.\nBecause we are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, you may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through the U.S. federal courts may be limited.\nWe are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon our directors or executive officers, or enforce judgments obtained in the United States courts against our directors or officers.\nOur corporate affairs will be governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Law (as the same may be supplemented or amended from time to time) and the common law of the Cayman Islands. We will also be subject to the federal securities laws of the United States. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are different from what they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and certain states, such as Delaware, may have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholders derivative action in a Federal court of the United States.\nWe have been advised by our Cayman Islands legal counsel that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state; and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.\nAs a result of all of the above, public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a United States company.\nWe previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Although these material weaknesses have been remedied as of June 30, 2022, we can give no assurance that any additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future.\nIn preparation of our financial statements for the period from October 19, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2021, we concluded that it should restate our previously issued financial statements to classify all Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in temporary equity. In accordance with the SEC and its staffs guidance on redeemable equity instruments in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the issuer, require ordinary shares subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. We previously classified a portion of our Class A ordinary shares in permanent equity. In connection with the change in presentation for the Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, we restated its earnings per share calculation to allocate income and losses shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. This presentation contemplates an initial business combination as the most likely outcome, in which case, both classes of shares participate pro rata in the income and losses of the Company.\nWe concluded that in light of the classification errors described above, a material weakness existed in our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, our management concluded that its control around the interpretation and accounting for certain complex financial instrument issued by us was not effectively designed or maintained and that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective for (i) the audited balance sheet as of December 7, 2020, (ii) the unaudited interim financial statements included in the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2020, as revised on Form 10-Q/A No. 1, (iii) the unaudited interim financial statements included in the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2021 (iv) and the unaudited interim financial statements included in the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2021.\nPreviously, following the issuance of the SEC Staff Statement on April 12, 2021 (the SEC Statement), we had concluded that, in light of the SEC Statement, it was appropriate to restate previously issued unaudited interim financial statements for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2021 in June 2021.\nWe concluded that in light of the classification errors described above, a material weakness existed in our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, our management concluded that its control around the accounting for a significant and unusual transaction related to our Warrants issued in connection with our Initial Public Offering in December 2020 was not effectively designed or maintained and that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective for (i) the unaudited interim financial statements included in the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2020 and (ii) the unaudited interim financial statements included in the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2021.\nAs of June 30, 2022, the foregoing material weaknesses had been remedied and our management concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2022.\nWe can give no assurance that no additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. In addition, our controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our financial statements.\nCyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nWe depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, including those of third parties with which we may deal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or\nsecurity breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud, could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. As an early stage company without significant investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences. We may not have sufficient resources to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss.\nSince holders of our Founder Shares are the only shareholders of the Company that will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors, upon the listing of our shares on the NYSE, the NYSE may consider us to be a controlled company within the meaning of the NYSE rules and, as a result, we may qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nOnly holders of our Founder Shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors. As a result, the NYSE may consider us to be a controlled company within the meaning of the NYSE corporate governance standards. Under the NYSE corporate governance standards, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\nwe have a board that includes a majority of independent directors, as defined under the rules of the NYSE;\nwe have a compensation committee of our board that is comprised entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities; and\nwe have a nominating and corporate governance committee of our board that is comprised entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities.\nWe do not intend to utilize these exemptions and intend to comply with the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE, subject to applicable phase-in rules. However, if we determine in the future to utilize some or all of these exemptions, you will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.\nRisks Associated with Acquiring and Operating a Business in Foreign Countries\nIf we pursue a target company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we may face additional burdens in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing such initial business combination, and if we effect such initial business combination, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations.\nIf we pursue a target company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we would be subject to risks associated with cross-border business combinations, including in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing our initial business combination, conducting due diligence in a foreign jurisdiction, having such transaction approved by any local governments, regulators or agencies and changes in the purchase price based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nIf we effect our initial business combination with such a company, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in an international setting, including any of the following:\ncosts and difficulties inherent in managing cross-border business operations;\nrules and regulations regarding currency redemption;\ncomplex corporate withholding taxes on individuals;\nlaws governing the manner in which future business combinations may be effected;\nexchange listing and/or delisting requirements;\ntariffs and trade barriers;\nregulations related to customs and import/export matters;\nlocal or regional economic policies and market conditions;\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\nlonger payment cycles;\ntax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States;\ncurrency fluctuations and exchange controls;\nrates of inflation;\nchallenges in collecting accounts receivable;\ncultural and language differences;\nemployment regulations;\nunderdeveloped or unpredictable legal or regulatory systems;\ncorruption;\nprotection of intellectual property;\nsocial unrest, crime, strikes, riots and civil disturbances;\nepidemics and pandemics;\nregime changes and political upheaval;\nterrorist attacks, natural disasters and wars; and\ndeterioration of political relations with the United States.\nWe may not be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, we may be unable to complete such initial business combination, or, if we complete such combination, our operations might suffer, either of which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our management following our initial business combination is unfamiliar with United States securities laws, they may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws, which could lead to various regulatory issues.\nFollowing our initial business combination, our management may resign from their positions as officers or directors of the company and the management of the target business at the time of the business combination will remain in place. Management of the target business may not be familiar with United States securities laws. If new management is unfamiliar with United States securities laws, they may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect our operations.\nAfter our initial business combination, substantially all of our assets may be located in a foreign country and substantially all of our revenue may be derived from our operations in any such country. Accordingly, our results of operations and prospects will be subject, to a significant extent, to the economic, political and social conditions and government policies, developments and conditions in the country in which we operate.\nThe economic, political and social conditions, as well as government policies, of the country in which our operations are located could affect our business. Economic growth could be uneven, both geographically and\namong various sectors of the economy and such growth may not be sustained in the future. If in the future such countrys economy experiences a downturn or grows at a slower rate than expected, there may be less demand for spending in certain industries. A decrease in demand for spending in certain industries could materially and adversely affect our ability to find an attractive target business with which to consummate our initial business combination and if we effect our initial business combination, the ability of that target business to become profitable.\nExchange rate fluctuations and currency policies may cause a target business ability to succeed in the international markets to be diminished.\nIn the event we acquire a non-U.S. target, all revenues and income would likely be received in a foreign currency, and the dollar equivalent of our net assets and distributions, if any, could be adversely affected by reductions in the value of the local currency. The value of the currencies in our target regions fluctuate and are affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. Any change in the relative value of such currency against our reporting currency may affect the attractiveness of any target business or, following consummation of our initial business combination, our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if a currency appreciates in value against the dollar prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, the cost of a target business as measured in dollars will increase, which may make it less likely that we are able to consummate such transaction.\nWe may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination, and the laws of such jurisdiction may govern some or all of our future material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights.\nIn connection with our initial business combination, we may relocate the home jurisdiction of our business from the Cayman Islands to another jurisdiction. If we determine to do this, the laws of such jurisdiction may govern some or all of our future material agreements. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital.\nWe are subject to changing law and regulations regarding regulatory matters, corporate governance and public disclosure that may increase both our costs and the risk of non-compliance.\nWe are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including, for example, the SEC, which are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded, and to new and evolving regulatory measures under applicable law. Our efforts to comply with any new or changing laws and regulations are likely to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from seeking a business combination target.\nMoreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. If we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, we may be subject to penalty and our business may be harmed.\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn connection with the assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern, we have until March 7, 2023 to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that we will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a\nmandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. We have determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should we be required to liquidate after March 7, 2023. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot Applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nWe currently maintain our executive offices at 511 6th Ave #7342, New York, New York 10011. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nLitigation Related to the Business Combination\nThe Company and the members of our Board of Directors have been named as defendants in a putative shareholder action filed on November 12, 2021 in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, captioned Avinash Nayak v. Far Peak Acquisition Corporation, et al., in connection with the Business Combination. The complaint generally alleges breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting claims relating to, among other things, alleged misstatements and omissions in this proxy statement/prospectus as filed by the Company with the SEC on November 1, 2021. The complaint seeks, among other things, injunctive relief and an award of attorneys fees. We believe these claims are without merit. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur units issued in the Initial Public Offering began trading on the NYSE under the symbol FPAC.UN on December 3, 2020. Beginning on January 19, 2021, holders of our units could elect to separately trade the shares of Class A ordinary shares and public warrants contained in the units or continue to trade the units without separating them. On such date, the shares of Class A ordinary shares and public warrants began trading on the NYSE under the symbols FPAC and FPAC.WS, respectively. Each whole public warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A ordinary shares at a price of $11.50 per half share, subject to adjustment as described in our final prospectus dated June 11, 2018 related to the Initial Public Offering which was filed with the SEC. Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares of Class A ordinary shares and will become exercisable 30 days after the completion of our Initial Business Combination. Our warrants expire five years after the completion of our Initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHolders\nAs of September 30, 2022, there was one holder of record of our units, one holder of our separately traded shares of Class A ordinary shares and one holder of record of our separately traded public warrants.\nDividends\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of our Initial Business Combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of our Initial Business Combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our Initial Business Combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. Further, if we incur any indebtedness in connection with our business combination, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\nNone\nPerformance Graph\nNot applicable\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Registered Offerings\nUnregistered Sales\nIn October 2020, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 9,750,000 shares of our founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.001 per share. Our Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into shares of Class A ordinary shares, on a one-for-one basis, upon the completion of a business combination.\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the Private Placement of 7,000,000 Private Placement Warrants, at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant with the sponsor and the Anchor Investor, generating gross proceeds of $10.5 million. In January 2022, March 2022 and May 2022,\npursuant to commitments made the sponsor and the Anchor Investor at the time of the Initial Public Offering, we sold, in each of three similar transactions, an additional 33,333 Private Placement Warrants to each of the sponsor and the Anchor Investor at a price of $1.50 per warrant.\nThe sale of the founder shares and the private placement warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.\nUse of Proceeds\nOf the $610,500,000 in proceeds, we received from our Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, a total of $600,000,000, including $15,437,500 payable to the underwriter for deferred underwriting commissions, was placed in the trust account.\nThere has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from such use as described in the Companys final prospectus (File No. 333- 250129), dated December 2, 2020, and filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act on December 3, 2020.

We were incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase,\nreorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. We are not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. We are an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, are subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.\nOur sponsor is Far Peak LLC, a Cayman Islands exempted limited liability company. The registration statement for our Initial Public Offering was declared effective on December 2, 2020. On December 7, 2020, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 55,000,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $550.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $23.7 million, inclusive of $7.5 million in underwriting commissions, approximately $15.4 million in deferred underwriting commissions (Note 6), $400,000 in deferred legal fees, approximately $4.0 million of other expenses, and net of reimbursement from the underwriters of $3.6 million. Our underwriters were granted a 45-day option from the date of the final prospectus relating to the Initial Public Offering to purchase up to 8,250,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at $10.00 per Unit. On December 21, 2020, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option and purchased an additional 5,000,000 Units at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000.\nSimultaneously with the closing of our Initial Public Offering, we consummated the Private Placement of 7,000,000 warrants, at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant with the sponsor and the Anchor Investor, generating gross proceeds of $10.5 million. In January 2022, March 2022 and May 2022, pursuant to commitments made the sponsor and the Anchor Investor at the time of the Initial Public Offering, we sold, in each of three similar transactions, an additional 33,333 Private Placement Warrants to each of the sponsor and the Anchor Investor at a price of $1.50 per warrant.\nUpon the closing of our Initial Public Offering, the Private Placement, and the Over-Allotment Option $600.0 million ($10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement were placed in a trust account and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act.\nWe have until 27 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or March 7, 2023 (since we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for the initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering but has not completed the initial Business Combination within such 24 month period) to consummate a Business Combination (the Combination Period). However, if we have not completed a Business Combination within the Combination Period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish the rights of the public shareholders as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining public shareholders and our Board of Directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.\nProposed Bullish Transaction\nOn July 8, 2021, FPAC entered into the BCA with Bullish, the Merger Subs and Bullish Global. Please see the Explanatory Note at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The descriptions of each of these\nagreements, and each of the agreements described above, are qualified in their entirety by the agreements themselves, each of which is an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please refer to FPACs Form 8-K filed on July 9, 2021 for more information.\nConcurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the PIPE Investors entered into share subscription agreements pursuant to which the PIPE Investors have committed to subscribe for and purchase Bullish Class A ordinary shares at $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $300,000,000. The PIPE Investors include existing shareholders of Bullish Global or their respective affiliates. The Anchor Subscriber, who has subscribed for 7,500,000 Bullish Class A ordinary shares for an aggregate purchase price of $75,000,000, has also entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Bullish and our sponsor pursuant to which the Anchor Subscriber will purchase, for $1.00 per Bullish Warrant, from the sponsor or the Anchor Investor, 3,000,000 outstanding Bullish Warrants.. All commitments from the PIPE Investors, including the Anchor Subscriber, have expired in accordance with their terms on July 8, 2022.\nConcurrently with the execution of the BCA, the Sponsor, the Company, certain insiders of the Company and Bullish entered into the Letter Agreement Amendment, to be effective upon closing, with respect to certain lock-up arrangements, which provides that the Sponsor and such Company insiders will not, within certain periods of time from the closing of the Bullish Transaction and subject to certain exceptions, sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant of any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or agree to dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate with respect to or decrease a call equivalent position, any of the Bullish Class A ordinary shares issued in connection with the Bullish Transaction, or enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any security, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise, or publicly announce any intention to effect any such transaction\nAdditionally, the sponsor agreed that at the closing of the Bullish Transaction, it would (a) (i) forfeit for cancellation 1,950,000 Bullish Class A ordinary shares at the closing of the Bullish Transaction if more than 15,000,000 Class A ordinary shares of FPAC are validly tendered for redemption and not withdrawn or (ii) if no such Forfeiture occurs, be subject to additional lock-up restrictions with respect to such 1,950,000 Bullish Class A ordinary share (including 390,000 that will be transferred to the Anchor Investor as described below), and (b) forfeit for cancellation 400,000 Bullish Warrants.\nConcurrently with the execution of the BCA, each Anchor Investor has entered into a Side Letter agreement amending such Anchor Investors BR Subscription Agreement, which provides that such Anchor Investor will not, within certain periods of time from the closing of the Bullish Transaction and subject to certain exceptions, sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant of any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or agree to dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate with respect to or decrease a call equivalent position, any of the Bullish Class A ordinary shares issued in connection with the Bullish Transaction, or enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any security, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise, or publicly announce any intention to effect any such transaction.\nPursuant to the BR Subscription Agreements, the sponsor has agreed to transfer 1,950,000 Class B ordinary shares of FPAC (which will convert into 1,950,000 Bullish Class A ordinary shares) to the Anchor Investors at the price the sponsor originally paid for such shares (which was nominal). Pursuant to the Side Letters, the Anchor Investors agreed that (a) (i) if the Forfeiture occurs, the sponsor will convey to them 390,000 fewer Bullish Class A ordinary shares than the Anchor Investors otherwise would have received pursuant to the BR Subscription Agreements, and (ii) if no such Forfeiture occurs, such 390,000 Bullish Class A ordinary shares will be subject to additional lock-up restrictions and (b) at the closing of the Bullish Transaction, the Anchor Investors will (i) sell an aggregate 600,000 Bullish Warrants at a purchase price of $1.00 per Bullish Warrant to the Anchor Subscriber (comprising a portion of the Bullish 3,000,000 Warrants that the Anchor Subscriber is\nentitled to purchase under the Securities Purchase Agreement) and (ii) forfeit for cancellation an aggregate 100,000 Bullish Warrants.\nIn connection with the Bullish Transaction, certain related agreements have been, or will be, entered into on or prior to the closing of the Bullish Transaction, including: the Lock-Up Agreement, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and among Block.one and Bullish Global; the Letter Agreement Amendment; the Side Letters; the Target Voting Agreement, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and among FPAC, Block.one, Bullish Global and Bullish; the sponsor Voting Agreement, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and among FPAC, the sponsor, Bullish Global and Bullish; the Non-Competition Agreement, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and among Block.one, Brendan Blumer, FPAC, Bullish and Bullish Global; the Standstill Agreement, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and among Bullish, Block.one, Brendan Blumer and Kokuei Yuan; the Indemnification Agreement, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and between Block.one and Bullish; and the sponsor Release, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and between the sponsor and FPAC.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had approximately $2.2 million in our operating bank account and a working capital deficit of approximately $8.2 million.\nOur liquidity needs have been satisfied through a payment of $25,000 from our Sponsor to cover certain offering costs in exchange for the issuance of the Founder Shares (as defined below), a loan of approximately $195,000 to us under a promissory note from our Sponsor (the Promissory Note) (which was fully repaid on December 7, 2020), the reimbursement of certain offering costs from the underwriters of $3.6 million, and the net proceeds from the consummation of the Private Placement not held in the Trust Account (including the additional Private Placements completed in January, March and May, 2022). Additionally, the Sponsor and the Anchor Investor have agreed to provide to the Company an aggregate of $1,000,000 of proceeds from the purchase of additional private placement warrants, at $1.50 per warrant, split between them pro rata in relation to their holdings of private placement warrants as necessary for working capital (or in lieu of such warrant purchase, the Sponsor will lend up to such amount to the Company) ($300,000 of this commitment has been funded to date). Liquidity needs have also been met through the $2.5 million extension fee paid by Bullish Global on June 29, 2022. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, our officers, directors and Initial Shareholders may, but are not obligated to, provide us Working Capital Loans. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, there were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loans.\nIn connection with the assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern, we have until March 7, 2023 to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that we will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. We have determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should we be required to liquidate after March 7, 2023. Managements current intention is to complete the business combination with Bullish by December 31, 2022.\nResults of Operations\nOur entire activity from inception up to September 30, 2022 was in preparation for our formation and the Initial Public Offering. We will not be generating any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial Business Combination, at the earliest.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, we had net income of approximately $54.7 million, which consisted of approximately $41.0 million in change in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities, approximately $2.5 million income from investments held in trust account, $2.5 million in extension fee income and approximately $15.4 million gain on settlement of deferred underwriting commissions, offset by approximately $6.6 million in general and administrative expenses.\nFor the period from October 19, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2021, we had a net loss of approximately $4.7 million, which consisted of approximately $7.0 million in general and administrative expenses, $3.5 million loss on the sale of Private Placement Warrants and approximately $1.7 million in offering costs, offset by approximately $7.3 million in change in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities and approximately $209,000 income from investments held in trust account.\nRelated Party Transactions\nFounder Shares\nOn October 21, 2020, our sponsor paid $25,000 to cover certain offering costs in consideration for 9,750,000 Class B ordinary shares (the Founder Shares). Our sponsor agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares until the earliest of: (A) one year after the completion of a Business Combination and (B) subsequent to a Business Combination, (x) if the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share dividends, rights issuances, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after a Business Combination, or (y) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the public shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property.\nPromissory Note-Related Party\nOn October 21, 2020, we issued a Promissory Note to our sponsor, pursuant to which we may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $300,000. The Promissory Note was non-interest bearing and payable upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering. We borrowed approximately $195,000 under the Promissory Note and repaid the Promissory Note in full on December 7, 2020. Subsequent to the repayment, the facility is no longer available to us.\nIn order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required (Working Capital Loans). Such Working Capital Loans will be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes may be repaid upon completion of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lenders discretion, up to $1,500,000 of notes may be converted upon completion of a Business Combination into warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant. Such warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the proceeds held outside the trust account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the trust account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Additionally, our sponsor and the Anchor Investor have agreed to provide to us an aggregate of $1,000,000 of proceeds from the purchase of additional private placement warrants, at $1.50 per warrant, split between them pro rata in relation to their holdings of private placement warrants as necessary for working capital (or in lieu of such warrant purchase, our sponsor will lend up to such amount to us). As of September 30, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Working Capital Loans.\nAdditional Private Placements - Related Party\nAdditionally, our Sponsor and Anchor Investor have agreed to provide to us an aggregate of $1,000,000 of proceeds from the purchase of additional private placement warrants, at $1.50 per warrant, split between them pro rata in relation to their holdings of private placement warrants as necessary for working capital (or in lieu of such warrant purchase, the Sponsor will lend up to such amount to us) ($300,000 of this commitment has been funded to date). In January 2022 and March 2022, pursuant to this commitment, the Sponsor and the Anchor Investor purchased (in each private placement transaction), an additional 66,666 Private Placement Warrant (33,333 each) for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $100,000. On May 13, 2022, pursuant to commitments made at the time of the Initial Public Offering, we completed the sale of an additional 66,666 Private Placement Warrants at $1.50 per warrant for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $100,000) to the Sponsor and the Anchor Investor (33,333 each).\nServices Agreement - Related Party\nOn July 5, 2022, we entered into a Services Agreement with Far Peak Management Company LLC (Management), an affiliate of the Sponsor, pursuant to which Management provides certain services necessary for the conduct of our business, and we agreed to reimburse Management for its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (including without limitation, reasonable out-of-pocket costs of salary and benefits to Service Providers employees) incurred in providing the services in amounts not to exceed $70,000 per calendar quarter.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nRegistration Rights\nThe holders of our Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and any warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (and any Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement signed on the effective date of the Initial Public Offering. The holders of these securities will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a Business Combination. However, the registration rights agreement provides that we will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until termination of the applicable lockup period.\nDeferred Legal Fees\nWe entered into an engagement letter with legal counsel to obtain legal advisory services, related to our Initial Public Offering, pursuant to which the legal counsel agreed to defer their fees (deferred legal fees). The deferred legal fees will become payable solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the engagement letter. On December 7, 2020, we recorded deferred legal fees of $400,000 in connection with legal services received for the Initial Public Offering.\nLease Agreement\nOn January 12, 2021, we executed a lease agreement with an affiliate of our sponsor, subleasing office approximately 2,300 square feet space in New York, New York. During its term, prior to July 27. 2021, the lease required monthly minimum lease payments of $12,500. On July 27, 2021, we amended the lease agreement to a lease payment of $37,500 during the term of the sublease, which ended April 30, 2022.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the search for a potential target business; however, we are not aware of any pending or threatened litigation that it believes is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThis managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to fair value of financial instruments and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets\nand liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management has identified the following as its critical accounting policies:\nDerivative warrant liabilities\nWe do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial instruments, including issued stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC 480 and ASC 815-15. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period.\nThe Public Warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants are recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40. Accordingly, we recognize the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjust the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in our statement of operations. The fair value of the Public Warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement Warrants were initially measured at fair value using a Binomial Lattice simulation model. The fair value of Public Warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering have subsequently been measured based on the listed market price of such warrants. As the transfer of Private Placement Warrants to anyone who is not a permitted transferee would result in the Private Placement Warrants having substantially the same terms as the Public Warrants, we determined, through use of a Binomial Lattice model, that the fair value of each Private Placement Warrant is equivalent to that of each Public Warrant. The determination of the fair value of the warrant liability may be subject to change as more current information becomes available and accordingly the actual results could differ significantly.\nClass A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption\nWe account for our Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Class A ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A ordinary shares (including Class A ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity. Our Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, as of Initial Public Offering, 60,000,000 Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders equity section of our balance sheet.\nThe Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of the Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. This method would view the end of the reporting period as if it were also the redemption date for the security. Effective with the closing of the Initial Public Offering (including exercise of the over-allotment option), we recognized the accretion from initial book value to redemption amount, which resulted in charges against additional paid-in capital (to the extent available) and accumulated deficit.\nNet Income (Loss) Per Ordinary Share\nWe comply with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. We have two classes of shares, which are referred to as Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. Net income (loss) per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average ordinary shares outstanding for the respective period.\nThe calculation of diluted net income (loss) per ordinary shares does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering (including exercise of the over-allotment option) and the Private Placement to purchase an aggregate of 27,000,000 ordinary shares in the calculation of diluted income (loss) per share, because their exercise is contingent upon future events. As a result, diluted net income (loss) per share is the same as basic net income (loss) per share for the year ended September 30, 2022 and for the period from October 19, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2021. Accretion associated with the redeemable Class A ordinary shares is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncement\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-03, ASC Subtopic 820, Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions. The ASU amends ASC 820 to clarify that a contractual sales restriction is not considered in measuring an equity security at fair value and to introduce new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value. The ASU applies to both holders and issuers of equity and equity-linked securities measured at fair value. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The Company is still evaluating the impact of this pronouncement on the financial statements.\nThe Companys management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards updates, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nJOBS Act\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, the financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.\nAdditionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditors attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEOs compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our Initial Public Offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAs of September 30, 2022, we were not subject to any material market or interest rate risk. Following the consummation of our Initial Public Offering, the net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering, including amounts in the trust account, were invested in U.S. government treasury bills, notes or bonds with a maturity of 180 days or less or in certain money market funds that invest solely in U.S. treasuries. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we do not believe that there will be an associated material exposure to interest rate risk.\nWe have not engaged in any hedging activities since our inception and we do not expect to engage in any hedging activities with respect to the market risk to which we are exposed. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThis information appears following Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2022.\nDisclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagements Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nAs required by SEC rules and regulations implementing of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company,\n(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and\n(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at September 30, 2022. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting at September 30, 2022.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022 covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, the rules of the NYSE and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors, and the rules of the NYSE require that the compensation committee and the nominating and corporate governance committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors.\nAudit Committee\nUpon the completion of the Initial Public Offering, we established an audit committee of the board of directors. Under the NYSE listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least three members of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent.\nEach member of the audit committee is financially literate. Stanley A. McChrystal, Nicole Seligman and Charles Vice serve as members of our audit committee, and Mr. Vice serves as its Chair. Our board of directors has determined that Mr. Vice qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in applicable SEC rules.\nWe adopted an audit committee charter, which details the principal functions of the audit committee, including:\nthe appointment, compensation, retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm and any other independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us;\npre-approving all audit and permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm or any other registered public accounting firm engaged by us, and establishing pre-approval policies and procedures;\nreviewing and discussing with the independent registered public accounting firm all relationships the auditors have with us in order to evaluate their continued independence;\nsetting clear hiring policies for employees or former employees of the independent registered public accounting firm;\nsetting clear policies for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations;\nobtaining and reviewing a report, at least annually, from the independent registered public accounting firm describing (i) the independent registered public accounting firms internal quality-control procedures and (ii) any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the audit firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities within the preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm and any steps taken to deal with such issues;\nreviewing and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC prior to us entering into such transaction; and\nreviewing with management, the independent registered public accounting firm, and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory or compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published reports that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in accounting standards or rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nCompensation Committee\nUpon the completion of the Initial Public Offering, we established a compensation committee of the board of directors. Stanley A. McChrystal, Nicole Seligman and Charles Vice serve as members of our compensation committee, and General McCrystal serves as its Chair. Under the NYSE listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least two members of the compensation committee, all of whom must be independent. General McChrystal, Ms. Seligman and Mr. Vice are independent.\nWe adopted a compensation committee charter, which details the principal functions of the compensation committee, including:\nreviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officers compensation, evaluating our Chief Executive Officers performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer based on such evaluation;\nreviewing and approving on an annual basis the compensation of all of our other officers;\nreviewing on an annual basis our executive compensation policies and plans;\nimplementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans;\nassisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements;\napproving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our officers and employees;\nif required, producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and\nreviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, as indicated above, other than reimbursement of expenses, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, has been or will be paid to any of our current shareholders, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate the consummation of a business combination.\nThe charter also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by the NYSE and the SEC.\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nUpon completion of the Initial Public Offering, we established a nominating and corporate governance committee. The members of our nominating and corporate governance are Stanley A. McChrystal, Nicole Seligman and Charles Vice. Ms. Seligman will serve as chair of the nominating and corporate governance committee.\nThe primary purposes of our nominating and corporate governance committee will be to assist the board in:\nidentifying, screening and reviewing individuals qualified to serve as directors and recommending to the board of directors candidates for nomination for appointment at the annual general meeting or to fill vacancies on the board of directors;\ndeveloping, recommending to the board of directors and overseeing implementation of our corporate governance guidelines;\ncoordinating and overseeing the annual self-evaluation of the board of directors, its committees, individual directors and management in the governance of the company; and\nreviewing on a regular basis our overall corporate governance and recommending improvements as and when necessary.\nThe nominating and corporate governance committee will be governed by a charter that complies with the rules of the NYSE.\nDirector Nominations\nOur nominating and corporate governance committee will recommend to the board of directors candidates for nomination for election at the annual meeting of the shareholders. We have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors considers educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent the best interests of our shareholders.\nCode of Ethics\nOn December 2, 2020 we adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (our Code of Ethics) applicable to our directors, officers and employees. We filed a copy of our Code of Ethics, corporate governance guidelines, and our nominating and governance, audit and compensation committee charters as exhibits to the registration statement filed on November 16, 2020. You may review these documents by accessing our public filings at the SECs web site at www.sec.gov. In addition, a copy of the Code of Ethics may be provided without charge upon request from us. To make a request please submit a written request to FPAC. ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nNone of our executive officers or directors have received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. No compensation of any kind, including finders and consulting fees, will be paid to our sponsor, directors and officers, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the completion of our Initial Business Combination. However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, directors or officers, or our or their affiliates.\nAfter the completion of our Initial Business Combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or management fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to shareholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our shareholders in connection with a proposed business combination. We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed business combination, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors.\nWe do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our Initial Business Combination, although it is possible that some or all of our directors and officers may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with us after our Initial Business Combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our managements motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our Initial Business Combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements with our directors and officers that provide for benefits upon termination of employment. ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our Class A ordinary shares as of September 30, 2022 by:\neach person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding shares of Class A ordinary shares;\neach of our directors and executive officers that beneficially owns FPAC ordinary shares; and\nall our directors and executive officers as a group.\nUnless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of Class A ordinary shares beneficially owned by them.\nOn October 21, 2020, our sponsor paid $25,000 to cover certain offering costs in consideration for 9,750,000 Class B ordinary Founder Shares.

Dearborn Street, 32nd Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60603. ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE\nOn October 21, 2020, our sponsor paid $25,000, or approximately $0.0026 per share, to cover certain offering costs on our behalf in consideration of 9,750,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001. The number of Founder Shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such Founder Shares would represent 15.1% of the issued and outstanding shares upon completion of the Initial Public Offering. The Founder Shares (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder. Upon consummation of our initial business combination, our sponsor will sell an aggregate of 1,950,000 Founder Shares to our Anchor Investor for the same price originally paid for such shares by our sponsor.\nOur sponsor purchased 7,000,000 private placement warrants for a purchase price of $1.50 per whole warrant in a private placement that occurred simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering. As such, our sponsors interest and our Anchor Investors in this transaction is valued at $10,500,000. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. In January 2022, March 2022 and May 2022, pursuant to commitments made the sponsor and the Anchor Investor at the time of the Initial Public Offering, we sold, in each of three similar transactions, an additional 33,333 private placement warrants to each of the sponsor and the Anchor Investor at a price of $1.50 per warrant. The private placement warrants (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. The Anchor Investor has agreed that if, in connection with an initial business combination, the sponsor decides (i) to forfeit, transfer to a third person, exchange, subject to transfer, vesting or conditional forfeiture provisions or amend the terms of all or any portion of the Founder Shares or the private placement warrants or (ii) to enter into any other arrangements with respect to the Founder Shares or the private placement warrants, including voting in favor of any amendment to the terms of the Founder Shares or the private placement warrants (each, a Change in Investment), such Change in Investment shall apply pro rata to the Anchor Investor and the sponsor based on the relative number of Founder Shares or private placement warrants to be held by each upon consummation of the initial business combination; provided, however that in no event shall such Change in Investment apply to more than 25% of the Founder Shares to be purchased by the Anchor Investor or 20% of the private placement warrants held by the Anchor Investor.\nIf any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us.\nNo compensation of any kind, including finders and consulting fees, will be paid to our sponsor, officers and directors, or their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the completion of an initial business combination. However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf.\nPrior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, our sponsor agreed to loan us up to $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of the Initial Public Offering. This loan was non-interest bearing and payable upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering. We fully repaid the sponsor and the advances to our sponsor upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering out of the offering proceeds not held in the trust account.\nIn addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete an initial business combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Additionally, if necessary for working capital, our sponsor and the Anchor Investor have agreed to provide to us an aggregate of $1,000,000 of proceeds from the purchase of additional private placement warrants, at $1.50 per warrant, split between them pro rata in relation to their holdings of private placement warrants (or in lieu of such warrant purchase, our sponsor will lend up to such amount to us). We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, its affiliates or our management team as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.\nAfter our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our shareholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, furnished to our shareholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a general meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation.\nWe will enter into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which our sponsor, Anchor Investor and directors will be entitled to certain registration rights with respect to the private placement warrants, the warrants issuable upon conversion of working capital loans (if any) and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the foregoing and upon conversion of the Founder Shares, as long as the sponsor and directors hold any securities covered by the registration agreement. ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES\nThe following is a summary of fees paid to WithumSmith+Brown, PC, for services rendered.\nAudit Fees.

The following financial statements are submitted as part of this report:\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nBalance Sheets at September 30, 2022 and 2021\nStatements of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2022 and for the period from October 19, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2021\nStatements of Changes in Shareholders Deficit for the year ended September 30, 2022 and for the period from October 19, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2021\nStatements of Cash Flows for the year ended September 30, 2022 and for the period from October 19, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2021\nNotes to Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nFar Peak Acquisition Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Far Peak Acquisition Corporation (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, changes in shareholders deficit and cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2022 and for the period from October 19, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2022 and for the period from October 19, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, if the Company is unable to raise additional funds to alleviate liquidity needs and complete a business combination by March 7, 2023 then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The liquidity condition and date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\nOur audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ WithumSmith+Brown, PC\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2020.\nNew York, New York\nDecembe\nr 12, 2\nPCAOB ID Number 100\nFAR PEAK ACQUISITION CORPORATION\nBALANCE SHEETS\nSeptember 30,\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash\n$ 2,220,941\n$ 172,454\nPrepaid expenses\n76,042\n642,917\nTotal current assets\n2,296,983\n815,371\nInvestments held in Trust Account\n602,690,646\n600,209,262\nTotal Assets\n$\n604,987,629\n$\n601,024,633\nLiabilities, Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption and Shareholders Deficit:\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccrued expenses\n$ 10,436,125\n$ 5,155,500\nAccounts payable\n69,668\n29,474\nTotal current liabilities\n10,505,793\n5,184,974\nDeferred legal fees\n400,000\n400,000\nDeferred underwriting commissions\n-\n15,437,500\nDerivative warrant liabilities\n5,983,998\n46,710,000\nTotal liabilities\n16,889,791\n67,732,474\nCommitments and Contingencies\nClass A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption; 60,000,000 shares at approximately $10.04 and $10.00 per share at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n602,590,646\n600,000,000\nShareholders Deficit\nPreference shares, $0.0001 par value; 5,000,000 shares authorized; none issued or outstanding\n-\n-\nClass A ordinary shares, $0.0001 par value; 500,000,000 shares authorized; no non-redeemable\nshares issued or outstanding\n-\n-\nClass B ordinary shares, $0.0001 par value; 50,000,000 shares authorized; 9,750,000 shares issued and outstanding\nAdditional paid-in\ncapital\n-\n-\nAccumulated deficit\n(14,493,783 )\n(66,708,816 )\nTotal shareholders deficit\n(14,492,808 )\n(66,707,841 )\nTotal Liabilities, Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption and Shareholders Deficit\n$\n604,987,629\n$\n601,024,633\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\nFAR PEAK ACQUISITION CORPORATION\nSTATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor the Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nFor the Period from\nOctober 19, 2020\n(Inception) through\nSeptember 30, 2021\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n$ 6,639,206\n$ 7,010,698\nLoss on operations\n(6,639,206 )\n(7,010,698 )\nOther income (expenses):\nChange in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities\n40,954,000\n7,290,000\nLoss on sale of Private Placement Warrants\n-\n(3,500,000 )\nFinancing costs -

The Company was incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (a Business Combination). The Company is not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from October 19, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2022 relates to the Companys formation and the initial public offering (the Initial Public Offering), and since closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective initial Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating\nincome in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.\nThe Companys sponsor is Far Peak LLC, a Cayman Islands exempted limited liability company sponsor (Sponsor). The registration statement for the Companys Initial Public Offering was declared effective on December 2, 2020. On December 7, 2020, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 55,000,000 units (the Units and with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the Public Shares), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $550.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $23.7 million, inclusive of $7.5 million in underwriting commissions, approximately $15.4 million in deferred underwriting commissions (Note 6), $400,000 in deferred legal fees, approximately $4.0 million of other expenses, and net of reimbursement from the underwriters of $3.6 million. The underwriters were granted a 45-day\noption from the date of the final prospectus relating to the Initial Public Offering to purchase up to 8,250,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at $10.00 per Unit. On December 21, 2020, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option and purchased an additional 5,000,000 Units at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000 (the Over-Allotment Option).\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private placement (Private Placement) of 7,000,000 warrants (each, a Private Placement Warrant and collectively, the Private Placement Warrants), at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant with the Sponsor and certain funds and accounts managed by subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively, the Anchor Investor), generating gross proceeds of $10.5 million (and in January, March and May 2022, pursuant to commitments made at the time of the Initial Public Offering, the Company completed the sale of an additional 199,998 Private Placement Warrants at $1.50 per warrant for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $300,000) (see Note 4).\nUpon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, $550.0 million ($10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, and upon the completion of the Over-Allotment Option a further $50.0 million of net proceeds of the sale of Units, were placed in a trust account (Trust Account) and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act), with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7\nof the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earliest of (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Companys shareholders, as described below.\nFAR PEAK ACQUISITION CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nInitial Business Combination\nThe Companys management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, including the Over-Allotment Option, and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The stock exchange listing rules require that the Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in the Trust Account and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account). The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination.\nThe Company will provide the holders of the public shares (the Public Shareholders) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of the Business Combination, either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination (initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share), including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, subject to certain limitations as described in the prospectus. The per-share\namount to be distributed to the Public Shareholders who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 6). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Companys warrants. The Class A ordinary shares were initially recognized at redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering, in accordance with ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.\nThe Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, it receives an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law approving a Business Combination, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company. If a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor agreed to vote the Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares, without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against a proposed Business Combination.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination and the Company does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Public Shares without the Companys prior written consent.\nFAR PEAK ACQUISITION CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Sponsor agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and any Public Shares held by it in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Companys obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Companys initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial\nbusiness combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share\nprice, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the Trust Account and not previously released to pay taxes, divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares.\nThe Company has until 27 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or March 7, 2023 (since the Company has executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for the initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering but has not completed the initial Business Combination within such 24 month period) to consummate a Business Combination, the Combination Period. However, if the Company has not completed a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned and not previously released the Company to pay taxes, if any (less up to\n$100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish the rights of the Public Shareholders as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Companys remaining Public Shareholders and its Board of Directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to the Companys obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Companys warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.\nThe Sponsor agreed to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Founder Shares it will receive if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor or any of its respective affiliates acquire Public Shares, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, and in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).\nIn order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than the Companys independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (1) $10.00 per Public Share and (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.00 per Public Share, due to reductions in the value of trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek\nFAR PEAK ACQUISITION CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\naccess to the Trust Account and as to any claims under the Companys indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than the Companys independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.\nProposed Bullish Transaction\nOn July 8, 2021, as disclosed in the Companys Form 8-K\nfiled July 9, 2021, the Company entered into a Business Combination Agreement (as amended, the BCA), by and among (i) the Company, (ii) Bullish, a Cayman Islands exempted company (Pubco), (iii) BMC 1, a Cayman Islands exempted company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Pubco, (iv) BMC 2, a Cayman Islands exempted company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Pubco and (v) Bullish Global, a Cayman Islands exempted company. Under the original BCA, each of the Company and Bullish Global had the right to terminate the BCA if the proposed transaction (the Bullish Transaction) had not been consummated by March 8, 2022 (the Outside Date). On March 7, 2022, the Company, Bullish, the Merger Subs and Bullish Global entered into an amendment to the original BCA extend the Outside Date to May 9, 2022. On May 6, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to the BCA to extend the Outside Date from May 9, 2022, to July 8, 2022.\nOn June 29, 2022, the Company, Bullish, the Merger Subs and Bullish Global entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Business Combination Agreement (the Third Business Combination Agreement Amendment) to further extend the Outside Date to December 31, 2022 in order to facilitate the completion of the Transactions. Additionally, as consideration for the Companys agreement to enter into the Third Business Combination Agreement Amendment, Bullish Global paid a $2.5 million extension fee at the time of signing. The fee will be used for working capital of FPAC, including payments of no more than $70,000 per quarter to an entity affiliated with the Sponsor to reimburse it for certain out-of-pocket\ncosts for employee salary and benefits incurred on behalf of the Company.\nUnder the terms of the BCA, each of the Company and Bullish have the right to terminate the BCA if the Bullish Transaction has not been consummated by the Outside Date.\nConcurrently with the execution of the BCA, certain investors (the PIPE Investors) entered into share subscription agreements pursuant to which the PIPE Investors have committed to subscribe for and purchase Pubco Class A ordinary shares at $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $300,000,000. The PIPE Investors include existing shareholders of Bullish Global or their respective affiliates. One PIPE Investor (the Anchor Subscriber), who has subscribed for 7,500,000 Pubco Class A ordinary shares for an aggregate purchase price of $75,000,000, has also entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Pubco and the Companys Sponsor pursuant to which the Anchor Subscriber will purchase from the Sponsor or the Anchor Investor, 3,000,000 warrants to acquire Pubco Class A ordinary shares (each, a Pubco Warrant), at a purchase price of $1.00 per Pubco Warrant. On July 8, 2022, the PIPE Investors subscription agreements and the Anchor Subscribers Securities Purchase Agreement expired in accordance with their terms.\nAdditionally, concurrently with the execution of the BCA, pursuant to an amendment to that certain Letter Agreement, dated as of December 4, 2020, by and among the Sponsor and those certain insiders (the Letter\nFAR PEAK ACQUISITION CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAgreement Amendment), the Sponsor agreed that at the closing of the Bullish Transaction, it would (a) (i) forfeit for cancellation 1,950,000 Pubco Class A ordinary shares at the closing of the Bullish Transaction if more than 15,000,000 Class A ordinary shares of the Company are validly tendered for redemption and not withdrawn (the Forfeiture), or (ii) if no such Forfeiture occurs, be subject to additional lock-up\nrestrictions with respect to 1,950,000 Pubco Class A ordinary share (including 390,000 that will be transferred to the Anchor Investor as described below) received in the Bullish Transaction for such Class A ordinary shares of the Company, and (b) forfeit for cancellation 400,000 Pubco Warrants.\nConcurrently with the execution of the BCA, certain funds and accounts managed by subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. who invested in FPAC at the time of its initial public offering (collectively, the Anchor Investor) have each entered into a side letter agreement (each, a Side Letter and, collectively, the Side Letters) amending such Anchor Investors Subscription Agreement, dated November 12, 2020, by and between each such Anchor Investor, the Company and the Sponsor (the BR Subscription Agreements). Pursuant to the BR Subscription Agreements, the Sponsor has agreed to transfer 1,950,000 Class B ordinary shares of FPAC (which will convert into 1,950,000 Pubco Class A ordinary shares) to the Anchor Investor at the price the Sponsor originally paid for such shares (which was nominal). Pursuant to the Side Letters, the Anchor Investors agreed that (a) (i) if the Forfeiture occurs, the Sponsor will convey to them 390,000 fewer Pubco Class A ordinary shares than the Anchor Investor otherwise would have received pursuant to the BR Subscription Agreements, and (ii) if no such Forfeiture occurs, such 390,000 Pubco Class A ordinary shares will be subject to additional lock-up\nrestrictions and (b) at the closing of the Bullish Transaction, the Anchor Investor will (i) sell an aggregate 600,000 Pubco Warrants at a purchase price of $1.00 per Pubco Warrant to the Anchor Subscriber (comprising a portion of the Pubco 3,000,000 Warrants that the Anchor Subscriber was entitled to purchase under the Securities Purchase Agreement) and (ii) forfeit for cancellation an aggregate 100,000 Pubco Warrants. The Anchor Investors commitment to sell 600,000 Pubco Warrants to the Anchor Subscriber terminated July 8, 2022.\nIn addition, the Side Letters provide that such Anchor Investor will not, within certain periods of time from the closing of the Bullish Transaction and subject to certain exceptions, sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant of any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or agree to dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate with respect to or decrease a call equivalent position, any of the Pubco Class A ordinary shares issued in connection with the Bullish Transaction, or enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any security, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise, or publicly announce any intention to effect any such transaction.\nIn connection with the Bullish Transaction, certain related agreements have been, or will be, entered into on or prior to the closing of the Bullish Transaction, including: the Lock-Up\nAgreement, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and among Block.one and Bullish Global; the Letter Agreement Amendment; the Side Letters; the Target Voting Agreement, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and among FPAC, Block.one, Bullish Global and Pubco; the Sponsor Voting Agreement, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and among FPAC, the Sponsor, Bullish Global and Pubco; the Non-Competition\nAgreement, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and among Block.one, Brendan Blumer, FPAC, Pubco and Bullish Global; the Standstill Agreement, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and among Pubco, Block.one, Brendan Blumer and Kokuei Yuan; the Indemnification Agreement, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and between Block.one and Pubco; and the Sponsor Release, dated as of July 8, 2021, by and between the Sponsor and FPAC.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nFAR PEAK ACQUISITION CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging\ngrowth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Companys financial statement with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had approximately $2.2 million in its operating bank account and a working capital deficit of approximately $8.2 million.\nThe Companys liquidity needs have been satisfied through a payment of $25,000 from the Sponsor to cover certain offering costs on behalf of the Company in exchange for the issuance of the Founder Shares (as defined below), the loan under the Promissory Note (as defined below) from the Sponsor of approximately $195,000 (see Note 5) to the Company (which was fully repaid on December 7, 2020), the reimbursement of certain offering costs from the underwriters of $3.6 million, and the net proceeds from the consummation of the Private Placement not held in the Trust Account (including the additional Private Placements in January, March and May 2022). Additionally, the Sponsor and the Anchor Investor have agreed to provide to the Company an aggregate of $1,000,000 of proceeds from the purchase of additional private placement warrants, at $1.50 per warrant, split between them pro rata\nin relation to their holdings of private placement warrants as necessary for working capital (or in lieu of such warrant purchase, the Sponsor will lend up to such amount to the Company) ($300,000 of this commitment has been funded to date). Liquidity needs have also been met through the $2.5 million extension fee paid by Bullish Global on June 29, 2022. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Companys officers, directors and Initial Shareholders may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, there were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loans (see Note 5).\nIn connection with the assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) ASC Topic 205-40,\nPresentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern, the Company has until March 7, 2023 to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated by\nFAR PEAK ACQUISITION CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nthis date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after March 7, 2023.\nManagements current intention is to complete the business combination with Bullish by December 31, 2022.\nNote 2-Summary\nof Significant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. One of the more significant accounting estimates included in these financial statements is the determination of the fair value of the warrant liability. Such estimates may be subject to change as more current information becomes available and accordingly the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company does not have any cash equivalents as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of cash and investments held in the Trust Account. Cash is maintained in accounts with financial institutions, which, at times may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage limit of $250,000, and investments held in the Trust Account. The Company has not experienced losses on its cash accounts and management believes, based upon the quality of the financial institutions, that the credit risk with regard to these deposits is not significant. The Companys investments held in the Trust Account consists entirely of money market fund invested solely in U.S. government securities with an original maturity of 185 days or less.\nInvestments Held in Trust Account\nThe Companys portfolio of investments is comprised of U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or investments in money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities and generally have a readily determinable fair value, or a combination thereof. When the Companys investments held in the Trust Account are comprised of U.S. government securities, the investments are classified as trading securities. When the Companys investments held in the Trust Account are comprised of money market funds, the investments are recognized at fair value. Trading securities and investments in money market funds are presented on the balance sheets at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of these securities are included in income from investments held in Trust Account in the accompanying statements of operations. The estimated fair values of investments held in the Trust Account are determined using available market information.\nFAR PEAK ACQUISITION CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of the Companys assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments under the FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements, equal or approximate the carrying amounts represented in the balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature (except for the derivative warrant liabilities, see Note 10).\nFair Value Measurements\nThe hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers consist of:\nLevel 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;\nLevel 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and\nLevel 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\nIn some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nOffering Costs Associated with the Initial Public Offering\nOffering costs consisted of legal, accounting, underwriting fees and other costs incurred through the Initial Public Offering that were directly related to the Initial Public Offering. Offering costs are allocated to the separable financial instruments issued in the Initial Public Offering based on a relative fair value basis, compared to total proceeds received. Offering costs associated with warrant liabilities are expensed as incurred, presented as non-operating\nexpenses in the statements of operations. Offering costs associated with the Public Shares were charged against the carrying value of the Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering including exercise of overallotment option. The Company classifies deferred underwriting commissions as non-current liabilities as their liquidation is not reasonably expected to require the use of current assets or require the creation of current liabilities.\nDerivative Warrant Liabilities\nThe Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including issued ordinary share purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC 480 and ASC 815-15.\nThe classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed\nat the end of each reporting period.\nThe Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants are recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40.\nAccordingly, the Company recognizes the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities are subject to re-measurement\nat each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Companys statements of operations. The fair value of the Public Warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement Warrants were initially measured at fair value using a Binomial Lattice model. The fair value of\nFAR PEAK ACQUISITION CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPublic Warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering have subsequently been measured based on the listed market price of such warrants. As the transfer of Private Placement Warrants to anyone who is not a permitted transferee would result in the Private Placement Warrants having substantially the same terms as the Public Warrants, the Company determined, through use of a Binomial Lattice model, that the fair value of each Private Placement Warrant is equivalent to that of each Public Warrant. The determination of the fair value of the warrant liability may be subject to change as more current information becomes available and accordingly the actual results could differ significantly.\nClass A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption\nThe Company accounts for its Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Class A ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A ordinary shares (including Class A ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Companys control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity. The Companys Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Companys control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, as of Initial Public Offering, 60,000,000 Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders deficit section of the Companys balance sheets.\nThe Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of the Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. This method would view the end of the reporting period as if it were also the redemption date for the security. Effective with the closing of the Initial Public Offering (including exercise of the over-allotment option), the Company recognized the accretion from initial book value to redemption amount, which resulted in charges against additional paid-in\ncapital (to the extent available) and accumulated deficit.\nNet Income (Loss) Per Ordinary Share\nThe Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. The Company has two classes of shares, which are referred to as Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. Net income (loss) per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average ordinary shares outstanding for the respective period.\nThe calculation of diluted net income (loss) per ordinary share does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering (including exercise of the over-allotment option) and the Private Placement to purchase an aggregate of\n27,000,000 ordinary shares in the calculation of diluted income (loss) per ordinary share, because their exercise is contingent upon future events. As a result, diluted net income (loss) per ordinary share is the same as basic net income (loss) per ordinary share for the period from October 19, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2021 and for the year ended September 30, 2022. Accretion associated with the redeemable Class A ordinary shares is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value.\nFAR PEAK ACQUISITION CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table reflects presents a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used to compute basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for each class of ordinary shares:\nFor the Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nFor the Period from\nOctober 19, 2020 (Inception)\nthrough September 30, 2021\nClass A\nClass B\nClass A\nClass B\nBasic and diluted net income (loss) per ordinary share:\nNumerator:\nAllocation of net income (loss) - basic and diluted\n$ 47,082,734\n$ 7,650,944\n$ (3,950,139 )\n$ (746,057 )\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted average ordinary shares outstanding\n60,000,000\n9,750,000\n51,623,188\n9,750,000\nBasic and diluted net income (loss) per ordinary share\n$ 0.78\n$ 0.78\n$ (0.08 )\n$ (0.08 )\nIncome Taxes\nFASB ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. The Companys management determined that the Cayman Islands is the Companys only major tax jurisdiction. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. No amounts were accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception.\nThere is currently no taxation imposed on income by the government of the Cayman Islands. In accordance with Cayman income tax regulations, income taxes are not levied on the Company. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Companys financial statements. The Companys management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncement\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-03,\nASC Subtopic 820, Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions. The ASU amends ASC 820 to clarify that a contractual sales restriction is not considered in measuring an equity security at fair value and to introduce new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value. The ASU applies to both holders and issuers of equity and equity-linked securities measured at fair value. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The Company is still evaluating the impact of this pronouncement on the financial statements.\nThe Companys management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards updates, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.\nFAR PEAK ACQUISITION CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 3-Initial\nPublic Offering\nOn December 7, 2020, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 55,000,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $550.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $23.7 million, inclusive of $7.5 million in underwriting commissions, approximately $15.4 million in deferred underwriting commissions, $400,000 in deferred legal fees, approximately $4.0 million of other expenses, and net of reimbursement from the underwriters of $3.6 million. The underwriters were granted a 45-day\nOver-Allotment Option from the date of the final prospectus relating to the Initial Public Offering to purchase up to 8,250,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at $10.00 per Unit. On December 21, 2020, the underwriters partially exercised the Over-Allotment Option and purchased an additional 5,000,000 at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000. Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Over-Allotment Option, an aggregate amount of $600,000,000 has been placed in the Companys trust account established in connection with the Initial Public Offering.\nEach Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-third\nof Public Warrant. Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share (see Note 7).\nNote 4-Private\nPlacement\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the Private Placement of 7,000,000 Private Placement Warrants, at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant with the Sponsor and the Anchor Investor, generating gross proceeds of $10.5 million. In January 2022 and March 2022, pursuant to commitments made at the time of the Initial Public Offering, the Company completed the sale of an additional 133,332 Private Placement Warrants at $1.50 per warrant for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $200,000.\nOn May 13, 2022, pursuant to commitments made at the time of the Initial Public Offering, the Company completed the sale of an additional 66,666 Private Placement Warrants at $1.50 per warrant for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $100,000 to the Sponsor and the Anchor Investor (33,333 each).\nEach Private Placement Warrant is exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 7). A portion of the proceeds from the Private Placement Warrants was added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law) and the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless.\nNote 5-Related\nParty Transactions\nFounder Shares\nOn October 21, 2020, the Sponsor paid $25,000 to cover certain offering costs of the Company in consideration for 9,750,000 Class B ordinary shares (the Founder Shares). The Sponsor agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares until the earliest of (A) one year after the completion of a Business Combination and (B) subsequent to a Business Combination, (x) if the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions,\nshare dividends, rights issuances, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading\nday period commencing at least 150 days after a Business Combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the Public Shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property.\nFAR PEAK ACQUISITION CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPromissory Note-Related Party\nOn October 21, 2020, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the Promissory Note) to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Company could borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $300,000. The Promissory Note was non-interest\nbearing and payable upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering. The Company borrowed approximately $195,000 under the Promissory Note and repaid the Promissory Note in full on December 7, 2020. Subsequent to repayment, the facility is no longer available to the Company.\nIn order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Companys officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (Working Capital Loans). Such Working Capital Loans will be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes may be repaid upon completion of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lenders discretion, up to $1,500,000 of notes may be converted upon completion of a Business Combination into warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant. Such warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no borrowings under the Working Capital Loans.\nAdditional Private Placements - Related Party\nAdditionally, the Sponsor and the Anchor Investor have agreed to provide to the Company an aggregate of $1,000,000 of proceeds from the purchase of additional private placement warrants, at $1.50 per warrant, split between them pro rata\nin relation to their holdings of private placement warrants as necessary for working capital (or in lieu of such warrant purchase, the Sponsor will lend up to such amount to the Company)($300,000 of this commitment has been funded to date). In January 2022 and March 2022, pursuant to this commitment, the Sponsor and the Anchor Investor purchased (in each private placement transaction), an additional 66,666 Private Placement Warrant (33,333 each) for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $100,000. On May 13, 2022, pursuant to commitments made at the time of the Initial Public Offering, the Company completed the sale of an additional 66,666 Private Placement Warrants at $1.50 per warrant for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $100,000) to the Sponsor and the Anchor Investor (33,333 each).\nServices Agreement - Related Party\nOn July 5, 2022, the Company entered into a Services Agreement with Far Peak Management Company LLC (Management Company), an affiliate of the Sponsor, pursuant to which Management Company provides certain services necessary for the conduct of the Companys business, and the Company agreed to reimburse Management Company for its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket\ncosts (including without limitation, reasonable out-of-pocket\ncosts of salary and benefits to Management Companys employees) incurred in providing the services in amounts not to exceed\n$70,000 per calendar quarter. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company reimbursed approximately $86,000 in such costs and there was no outstanding balance as of September 30, 2022 payable to Management Company.\nNote 6-Commitments\nand Contingencies\nRisks and Uncertainties\nManagement is continuing to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have an effect on the Companys financial position, results of its\nFAR PEAK ACQUISITION CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\noperations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nIn February 2022, the Russian Federation and Belarus commenced a military action with the country of Ukraine. As a result of this action, various nations, including the United States, have instituted economic sanctions against the Russian Federation and Belarus. Further, the impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy is not determinable as of the date of these financial statements and the specific impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is also not determinable as of the date of these financial statements.\nRegistration Rights\nThe holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and any warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (and any Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement signed on the effective date of the Initial Public Offering. The holders of these securities will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a Business Combination. However, the registration rights agreement provides that the Company will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until termination of the applicable lockup period.\nUnderwriting Agreement\nThe underwriters were entitled to a cash underwriting discount of approximately $0.14 per Unit, or $7.5 million in the aggregate, paid upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. In addition, the underwriters will be entitled to a deferred fee of approximately $0.2807 per Unit, or approximately $15.4 million in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. On May 20, 2022, the underwriters waived their deferred fee, resulting in a gain from settlement of deferred underwriting commissions of approximately $15.4 million.\nDeferred Legal Fees\nThe Company entered into an engagement letter with legal counsel to obtain legal advisory services, related to the Companys Initial Public Offering, pursuant to which the legal counsel agreed to defer their fees (deferred legal fees). The deferred fee will become payable solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the engagement letter. On December 7, 2020, the Company recorded deferred legal fees of $400,000 in connection with legal services received for its Initial Public Offering in the accompanying balance sheets.\nLease Agreement\nOn January 12, 2021, the Company executed a lease agreement with an affiliate of the Sponsor, subleasing office approximately 2,300 square feet space in New York, New York. The lease calls for monthly minimum lease payments of\n$\n12,500 during the term of the sublease, which ended on\nJanuary 30, 2022. On July\n27,\n2021, the Company amended the lease agreement to a lease payment of $\n37,500 during the term of the sublease, which\nFAR PEAK ACQUISITION CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nend\ned\nApril 30, 2022. For the year ended September\n30,\n2022 and the period from October\n19,\n2020 (inception) through September\n30,\n2021, the Company incurred approximately $\n37,500 and $\n150,000, respectively, in rental lease expenses.\nConsulting fees\nThe Company has an agreement with a third party consultant to provide certain advisory services to the Company relating to identification of and negotiation with potential targets, assistance with due diligence, marketing, financial analyses and investor relations, pursuant to which the consultant has agreed to defer its fees and have payment of such fees to be solely contingent on the Company closing a Business Combination. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company has incurred approximately $7.7 million in contingent fees pursuant to the agreement. The Company will recognize an expense for these services when the performance trigger is considered probable, which in this case will occur upon closing of a Business Combination.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, the Company may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the search for a potential target business; however, the Company is not aware of any pending or threatened litigation that it believes is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nNote 7-Derivative\nWarrant Liabilities\nPublic Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination and (b) one year from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Public Warrants will expire five years from the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\nThe Company will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration, or a valid exemption from registration is available. No warrant will be exercisable and the Company will not be obligated to issue a Class A ordinary share upon exercise of a warrant unless the Class A ordinary share issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants.\nThe Company agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days, after the closing of a Business Combination, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants, and the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the same to become effective within 60 business days after the closing of a Business Combination, and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement; provided that if the Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but it will use its commercially reasonable\nFAR PEAK ACQUISITION CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nefforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. If a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th day after the closing of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption, but the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.\nRedemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00.\nOnce the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants (except as described with respect to the Private Placement Warrants):\nin whole and not in part;\nat a price of $0.01 per warrant;\nupon a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and\nif, and only if, the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading\nday period ending three trading days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.\nIf and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.\nRedemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00.\nOnce the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants:\nin whole and not in part;\nat $0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption provided that holders will be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares determined based on the redemption date and the fair market value of the Class A ordinary shares;\nif, and only if, the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as adjusted) for any 20 trading days within the 30-trading\nday period ending three trading days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and\nif the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading\nday period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders is less than $18.00 per share (as adjusted), the Private Placement Warrants must also be concurrently called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding Public Warrants, as described above.\nFAR PEAK ACQUISITION CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIf the Company\ncalls the Public Warrants for redemption, as described above, its management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, except as described below, the Public Warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of ordinary shares at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Public Warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of Public Warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their Public Warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Companys assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such Public Warrants. Accordingly, the Public Warrants may expire worthless.\nIn addition, if (x) the Company issues additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of a Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per Class A ordinary share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Companys board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor, Anchor Investor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the Newly Issued Price), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of a Business Combination on the date of the consummation of a Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of its Class A ordinary shares during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its Business Combination (such price, the Market Value) is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $10.00 per share redemption trigger price will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.\nThe Private Placement Warrants will be identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units being sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis and be non-redeemable,\nexcept as described above, so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.\nNote 8-Class\nA Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption\nThe Companys Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Companys control and subject to the occurrence of future events. The Company is authorized to issue 500,000,000 Class A ordinary shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Holders of the Companys Class A ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, there were 60,000,000 Class A ordinary shares outstanding, which were all subject to possible redemption and are classified outside of permanent equity in the balance sheets.\nFAR PEAK ACQUISITION CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption reflected on the balance sheets is reconciled on the following table:\nGross proceeds from Initial Public Offering\n$ 600,000,000\nLess:\nFair value of Public Warrants at issuance\n(40,000,000 )\nOffering costs allocated to Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption\n(22,036,645 )\nPlus:\nAccretion on Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption amount\n62,036,645\nClass A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption at September 30, 2021\n600,000,000\nIncrease in redemption value of Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption\n2,590,646\nClass A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption at September 30, 2022\n$ 602,590,646\nNote 9-Shareholders\nDeficit\nPreference Shares\n-The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 preference shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share, with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Companys board of directors.

As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, there were 60,000,000 Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding, all of which were subject to possible redemption and are classified as temporary equity (see Note 8).\nClass\nB Ordinary Shares\n-The Company is authorized to issue 50,000,000 Class B ordinary shares, with a par value of $0.0001 per share.

Holders of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all other matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, except as required by law. The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of a Business Combination or earlier at the option of the holders thereof on a share-for-share\nbasis.\nNote 10-Fair\nValue Measurements\nThe following table presents information about the Companys financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 by level within the fair value hierarchy:\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nDescription\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets\n(Level 1)\nSignificant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant\nOther\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3)\nAssets:\nInvestments held in Trust Account-money market fund\n$ 602,690,646\n$ -\n$ -\nLiabilities:\nDerivative warrant liabilities-Public warrants\n$ 4,400,000\n$ -\n$ -\nDerivative warrant liabilities-Private warrants\n$ -\n$ 1,583,998\n$ -\nFAR PEAK ACQUISITION CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nDescription\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets\n(Level 1)\nSignificant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant\nOther\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3)\nAssets:\nInvestments held in Trust Account-money market fund\n$ 600,209,262\n$ -\n$ -\nLiabilities:\nDerivative warrant liabilities-Public warrants\n$ 34,600,000\n$ -\n$ -\nDerivative warrant liabilities-Private warrants\n$ -\n$ 12,110,000\n$ -\nTransfers to/from Levels 1, 2, and 3 are recognized at the beginning of the reporting period. The estimated fair value of Public Warrants was transferred from a Level 3 fair value measurement to a Level 1 measurement in January 2021, when the Public Warrants were separately listed and traded. The estimated fair value of the Private Warrants was transferred from a Level 3 measurement to a Level 2 fair value measurement as of January 2021, as the transfer of Private Placement Warrants to anyone who is not a permitted transferee would result in the Private Placement Warrants having substantially the same terms as the Public Warrants.\nThere were no other transfers to/from Levels 1, 2, and 3 for the period from October 19, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2022.\nLevel 1 instruments include investments in mutual funds invested in government securities. The Company uses inputs such as actual trade data, quoted market prices from dealers or brokers, and other similar sources to determine the fair value of its investments.\nThe fair value of Public Warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering are measured based on the listed market price of such warrants, a Level 1 measurement. As the transfer of Private Placement Warrants to anyone who is not a permitted transferee would result in the Private Placement Warrants having substantially the same terms as the Public Warrants, the Company determined that the fair value of each Private Placement Warrant is equivalent to that of each Public Warrant. For the year ended September 30, 2022 and the period from October 19, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2021 the Company recognized a charge to the statements of operations resulting from a decrease in the fair value of liabilities of approximately\n$41.0 million and $7.3 million, respectively, presented as change in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities on the accompanying statements of operations.\nNote 11-Subsequent\nEvents\nManagement has evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued. Based upon this review, the Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.\nb.
