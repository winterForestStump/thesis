    "content": "Item 1.Business.\nAltex Industries, Inc. (or the \"Registrant\" or the \"Company,\" each of which terms, when used herein, refer to Altex Industries, Inc. and/or its subsidiary) is a holding company with one full-time employee that was incorporated in Delaware in 1985. Through its operating subsidiary, AOC, the Company currently owns interests in onshore oil and gas properties, has bought and sold producing oil and gas properties, and, to a lesser extent, has participated in the drilling of exploratory and development wells, and in recompletions of existing wells.\nAll of AOCs interests are in properties operated by others. An interest owner in a property not operated by that interest owner must rely on information regarding the property provided by the operator, even though there can be no assurance that such information is complete, accurate, or current. In addition, an owner of a working interest in a property is potentially responsible for 100% of all liabilities associated with that property, regardless of the size of the working interest actually owned.\nThe operators of producing properties in which AOC has an interest sell produced oil and gas to refiners, pipeline operators, and processing plants. If a refinery, pipeline, or processing plant that purchases such production were taken out of service, the operator could be forced to halt the production that is purchased by such refinery, pipeline, or plant.\nAlthough many entities produce oil and gas, competitive factors play a material role in AOC's production operations only to the extent that such factors affect demand for and prices of oil and gas and demand for, supply of, and prices of oilfield services. The sale of oil and gas is regulated by Federal, state, and local agencies, and AOC is also subject to Federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the environment. These laws and regulations generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation. AOC regularly assesses its exposure to environmental liability and asset retirement obligations (ARO), which activities are covered by Federal, state, and local regulation. AOC does not believe that it currently has any material exposure to environmental liability or ARO, as it does not own any working interests. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nNot applicable. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNot applicable. Item 2.Properties.\nThe Companys estimated reserves at September 30, 2022, are 1,300 barrels of proved, developed oil reserves associated with the Companys 4.4% override in the Glo Field in Campbell County, Wyoming. The reserve estimate is prepared by the Companys registered profession petroleum engineer; management supplies the engineer with ownership and revenue data and reviews the reserve estimate for reasonableness. All the Companys interests in oil and gas properties are non-working interests. The Company did not participate in the drilling of any wells during the year ended September 30, 2021 (FY21) or the year ended September 30, 2022 (FY22). At December 23, 2022, the Company was not engaged in any oil and gas operations. The Company owns very small mineral interests in Utah. All the Companys production is located in Utah and Wyoming.\nProduction\nNet Production\nAverage Price\nAverage Production\nCost Per Equivalent\nBarrel\nFiscal Year\nOil\n(Bbls)\nGas\n(Mcf)\nOil\n(Bbls)\nGas\n(Mcf)\n$83.00\n$5.65\n$0.00\n$51.88\n$4.15\n$0.00\n$50.00\n$2.50\n$0.00 Item 3.Legal Proceedings.\nNone. Item 4.Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5.Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nThe Company's common stock is traded on OTC Pink under the symbol ALTX. At December 23, 2022, there were approximately 3,400 holders of record of the Company's common stock, excluding entities whose stock is held by clearing agencies. The Company has not paid a dividend during the last two fiscal years. The Company has no publicly announced plan or program for the purchase of shares and the Company has no compensation plans (including individual compensation arrangements) under which equity securities of the registrant are authorized for issuance. On October 26, 2022, the Company acquired 493,975 shares of its common stock for $44,556.55, and on November 9, 2022, the Company retired the 493,975 shares. Item 6. Reserved.\nNot applicable. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFinancial Condition\nIn FY22 operating activities used $129,000 cash, and the Company sold certain oil, gas, and mineral interests in Utah for $450,000 cash. In FY21 operating activities used $85,000 cash, and the Company used $19,000 cash to acquire 130,000 shares of its common stock. Consequently, cash balances increased $321,000 in FY22 and decreased $104,000 in FY21. On October 26, 2022, the Company acquired 493,975 shares of its common stock for $44,556.55, and on November 9, 2022, the Company retired the 493,975 shares. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, accrued expenses, related party, of $1,073,000 consists of $1,024,000 in salary payable to the Companys president, pursuant to his employment agreement, that the president has elected to defer, as well as $49,000 in related accrued payroll tax. The Companys president may require the Company to pay the unpaid salary and payroll tax liability at any time.\nThe Company is likely to experience negative cash flow from operations unless the Company invests in interests in producing oil and gas wells or in another venture that produces sufficient cash flow from operations. With the exception of capital expenditures related to production acquisitions or drilling or recompletion activities or an investment in another venture that produces cash flow from operations, none of which are currently planned, the cash flows that could result from such acquisitions, activities, or investments, and the possibility of a material change in the current level of interest rates or of oil and gas prices, the Company knows of no trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in the Company's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. Except for cash generated by the operation of the Company's producing oil and gas properties, asset sales, and interest income, the Company has no internal or external sources of liquidity other than its working capital. At December 23, 2022, the Company had no material commitments for capital expenditures.\nResults of Operations\nIn FY22 the Company realized a net gain of $450,000 from the sale of certain oil, gas, and mineral interests in Utah. Interest income increased from nil in FY21 to $14,000 in FY22 because of higher realized interest rates on cash balances. In FY22, other income consisted of $4,000 of out-of-period oil and gas sales received in 2022. In FY21, other income consisted of $56,000 of out-of-period oil and gas sales that, unbeknownst to the Company, an operator had held in suspense and that was received in 2021, and $1,000 of other out-of-period oil and gas sales received in 2021.\nAt the current levels of net oil and gas production, cash balances, interest rates, and oil and gas prices, the Companys revenue is unlikely to exceed its expenses. Unless the Company invests a substantial portion of its cash balances in interests in producing oil and gas wells or in one or more other ventures that produce revenue and net income, the Company is likely to experience net losses. With the exception of unanticipated ARO, unanticipated environmental expense, and possible changes in interest rates and oil and gas prices, the Company is not aware of any other trends, events, or uncertainties that have had or that are reasonably expected to have a material impact on net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations.\nClimate Change\nThe company does not believe that climate change or regulations adopted to mitigate the consequences of climate change will have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nNot applicable. Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe consolidated financial statements follow the signature page. Item 9.Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Companys Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding managements control objectives.\nAs of the end of the period covered by the report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Companys Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. Based upon the foregoing, the Companys Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiary) required to be included in the Companys Exchange Act reports. There have been no significant changes in the Companys internal controls or in other factors which could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date the Company carried out its evaluation.

(the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB .\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and the significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue from oil and gas production is recognized based on the sales date as reported to the Company by the operators of oil and gas production facilities in which the Company has a royalty interest.\nAuditing managements evaluation of the royalty revenue from its agreements with customers involves significant judgment based on the estimates of the revenue recorded and their subsequent true-up once payment is received.\nTo evaluate the appropriateness and accuracy of the revenue recorded by management, we evaluated managements assessment of the revenue recorded based on the Companys royalty interest.\n/s/ M&K CPAS, PLLC\nM&K CPAS, PLLC\nPCAOB ID: 2738\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2020\nHouston, TX\nDecember 23, 2022\nALTEX INDUSTRIES, INC.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nSeptember 30\nAssets\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents\n$2,358,000\n$2,037,000\nAccounts receivable\n1,000\n3,000\nOther\n26,000\n21,000\nTotal current assets\n2,385,000\n2,061,000\nProperty and equipment, at cost\nProved oil and gas properties (successful efforts method)\n327,000\n333,000\nLess accumulated depreciation, depletion, and valuation provision\n(292,000)\n(290,000)\nNet property and equipment\n35,000\n43,000\nRight-of-Use Asset\n71,000\n95,000\nTotal assets\n$2,491,000\n$2,199,000\nLiabilities and Stockholders Equity\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable\n$4,000\n$2,000\nOperating lease liability\n25,000\n23,000\nAccrued expenses, related party\n1,073,000\n1,073,000\nOther accrued expenses\n11,000\n11,000\nTotal current liabilities\n1,113,000\n1,109,000\nLong-term operating lease liability\n47,000\n72,000\nTotal liabilities\n1,160,000\n1,181,000\nCommitments and Contingencies\n-\n-\nStockholders equity\nPreferred stock, $0.01 par value.

AND SUBSIDIARY\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2022 and 2021\nNote 1 - Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nNature of operations: Altex Industries, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiary, jointly referred to as the Company, owns non-working interests in productive oil and gas properties located in Utah and Wyoming. The Companys revenues are generated from interest income from cash deposits and from sales of oil and gas production. The Companys operations are significantly affected by changes in interest rates and oil and gas prices.\nPrinciples of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Altex Industries, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nEstimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nProperty and equipment: The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas operations, under which exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, annual delay rentals, and exploratory dry hole costs, are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to acquire unproved properties, to drill and to equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves, and to drill and to equip development wells are capitalized. Capitalized costs relating to proved oil and gas properties are depleted on the units-of-production method based on estimated quantities of proved reserves and estimated ARO. Upon the sale or retirement of property and equipment, the cost thereof and the accumulated depreciation, depletion, and valuation allowance are removed from the accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to operations.\nImpairment of long-lived assets: The Company assesses long-lived assets for impairment when the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. This review compares the assets carrying value with managements estimate of its undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is recognized. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated cash flows, an impairment equal to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated cash flows is recognized. No such impairment may be restored in the future. The Companys proved oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment on an individual field basis.\nAsset retirement obligations: If the Company acquires a working interest in an oil and gas property that is placed in service, it records a liability for its ARO. Subsequently, the ARO liability is accreted to its then-present value. Inherent in the estimation of ARO are numerous assumptions and judgments including ultimate settlement amounts, inflation rates, discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in regulations. To the extent changes in these assumptions impact the estimate of the ARO, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. Settlements greater than or less than amounts accrued as ARO are recorded as a gain or loss upon settlement.\nEarnings (loss) per share: Basic earnings (loss) per share has been calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Under this method, the incremental number of shares used in computing diluted earnings per share (EPS) is the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and purchased using assumed proceeds. Diluted EPS amounts would include the effect of outstanding stock options, warrants, and other convertible securities if including such potential shares of common stock is dilutive. Basic and diluted earnings per share are the same in the periods presented as there are no such outstanding instruments at September 30, 2022, or September 30, 2021.\nFair value measurements: Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three levels of fair value estimation, based on the observability of inputs: Level 1. Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to Level 1 instruments. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment. Level 2. Valuations based on one or more quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3. Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company believes the amounts reported for the carrying value of cash, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses (related parties), and other accrued expenses, as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, approximate fair value, due to the short maturity of these instruments.\nCash Equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nIncome Taxes: The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. The asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Company reports uncertainty in income taxes according to GAAP. There was no increase in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits during the current year. The Company recognizes accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in general and administrative expense. There was neither interest nor penalty at September 30, 2022.\nConcentrations of credit risk: The Company maintains significant amounts of cash and sometimes permits cash balances to exceed insured limits.\nRevenue recognition: The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Substantially all the Companys revenue is from sales of oil and gas production, interest income, and, occasionally, bonus payments for mineral leases. Revenue from oil and gas production is recognized based on sales date as reported to the Company by the operators of oil and gas production facilities in which the company has an interest. Interest income is recognized when earned. The Company accounts for mineral lease bonus payments in accordance with the guidance set forth in ASC 932, Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas, and it classifies such income as other income. The Company recognizes revenue from mineral lease bonus payments when it has received both an executed agreement and the bonus payment, and the Company has no obligation to refund any portion of the payment. The Company classifies mineral lease bonus payments as other income because the leasing of mineral interests is not a principal business activity of the Company, and material amounts of mineral lease bonus payments do not occur with any regularity.\nOther Income: Other income is any income the Company receives that is neither oil and gas sales attributable to the current period nor interest income. Other income includes out-of-period sales revenue and various items of miscellaneous income as well as lease bonus payments.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements:\nIn February 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-2, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and right-of-use asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months. The provisions of ASU 2016-2 also modify the definition of a lease and outline the requirements for recognition, measurement,\npresentation, and disclosure of leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-2 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-2 effective October 1, 2019.\nIn December 2019 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740). The amendments in this Update simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted this Update effective October 1, 2021.\nNote 2 - Income Taxes. At September 30, 2022, the Company had a depletion carryforward of $860,000 and a net operating loss carryforward of $2,247,000, of which $1,949,000 will expire in the years 2028 through 2037. The approximate tax effect of each type of temporary difference and carryforward that gives rise to a significant portion of deferred tax assets at September 30, 2022, computed in accordance with the Income Tax Topic (Topic 740) of the Codification, is as follows:\nDeferred Tax Assets\nDepletion carryforward\n$\n181,000\n181,000\nNet operating loss carryforward\n472,000\n537,000\nAccrued shareholder salary\n215,000\n215,000\nDeletion and amortization\n3,000\n4,000\nTotal Net Deferred Tax Assets\n871,000\n937,000\nLess valuation allowance\n(871,000)\n(937,000)\nNet Deferred Tax Asset\n$\n-\n-\nA valuation allowance has been provided because of the uncertainty of future realization. Income tax expense is different from amounts computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate for the following reasons:\nTax expense (benefit) at 21% of net earnings (loss)\n$\n66,000\n(17,000)\nImpact of rate change effective January 1, 2018\n-\n-\nChange in valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets\n(66,000)\n(17,000)\nIncome tax expense\n$\n-\n-\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company has no unrecognized tax benefit as a result of uncertain tax positions. As of September 30, 2022, the Companys tax years that remain subject to examination are 2019 - 2022 (Federal jurisdiction) and 2018 - 2022 (state jurisdictions).\nNote 3 - Related Party Transactions. Effective October 1, 2021, the Company renewed its employment agreement with its president. The agreement has an initial term of five years and provides an annual base salary equal to the maximum annual contribution to a Health Flexible Spending Arrangement (FSA) and an annual bonus of no less than 20% of the Company's earnings before tax, payable, at the presidents election, in either cash or common stock of the Company at then fair market value. The Company matches any contribution that the president makes to the Companys FSA. The agreement contains provisions providing for payments to the president in the event of his disability or termination of his employment. At September 30, 2022, accrued expense, related party, includes $1,024,000 in salary payable to the Companys president, pursuant to his employment agreement, that the president has elected to defer, as well as $49,000 in related accrued payroll tax. The Companys president may require the Company to pay the unpaid salary and payroll tax liability at any time.\nNote 4 - Major Customers. In 2022 the Company had four customers who individually accounted for 10% or more of the Company's oil and gas sales and who, in aggregate, accounted for 93% of oil and gas sales. In 2022 the four customers individually accounted for 48%, 17%, 17%, and 11% of oil and gas sales. In 2021 the Company had three customers who individually accounted for 10% or more of the Company's oil and gas sales and who, in aggregate, accounted for 93% of oil and gas sales. In 2021 the three customers individually accounted for 63%, 17% and 13% of oil and gas sales.\nNote 5 - Leases. The Company rents office space under an operating lease that terminates on June 30, 2025. The Company may cancel the lease upon 30 days notice and the payment of a $4,000 termination fee. If the landlord sells the premises to an unrelated third party, the new landlord may reduce the term to one year from the date of purchase. The Company incurred lease cost of $28,000 in 2022 and $27,000 in 2021. The landlord may increase annual rent no more than CPI. On October 1, 2019, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC 842, Leases. The Company adopted ASC 842 using the optional modified retrospective transition method. Under this transition method, the Company did not recast the prior period financial statements. The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability of $118,000 at September 30, 2020.\nFuture minimum lease payments as of September 30\n28,000\n28,000\n22,000\nTotal\n78,000\nNote 6 - Oil and Natural Gas Properties. Oil and natural gas properties consist of the following:\nSeptember 30\nOil and natural gas properties\nProved, developed properties\n$\n327,000\n$\n333,000\nLess: accumulated depreciation, depletion and impairment\n(292,000)\n(290,000)\nTotal oil and natural gas properties\n$\n35,000\n$\n43,000\nAs the Company does not own working interests, it is not liable for the cost of well abandonment or surface restoration, so no ARO liability was recorded at September 30, 2022 and 2021. In the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company realized a net gain of $450,000 from the sale of certain oil, gas, and mineral interests in Utah. As the Company had no basis in these assets, $450,000 was recorded as gain on sale of assets in the year ended September 30, 2022.\nNote 7 - Equity and treasury stock transactions. In the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company purchased 130,000 shares of its common stock for an average price of $0.15 per share and retired the shares.\nNote 8 - Other Income. In the year ended September 30, 2022, other income consisted of $4,000 of out-of-period oil and gas sales received in 2022. In the year ended September 30, 2021, other income consisted of $56,000 of out-of-period oil and gas sales that, unbeknownst to the Company, an operator had held in suspense and that was received in 2021, and $1,000 of other out-of-period oil and gas sales received in 2021.\nNote 9 - Subsequent events. On October 26, 2022, the Company acquired 493,975 shares of its common stock for $44,556.55. On November 9, 2022, the Company retired the 493,975 shares. The Company has evaluated all transactions from September 30, 2022, through the financial statement issuance date and noted no other subsequent event warranting disclosure.\nNote 10 - Supplemental Financial Data - Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited). The Company's operations are confined to the continental United States, and all the Company's reserves are proved, developed.\nI. Capitalized Costs. Capitalized costs include the cost of properties, excluding any asset retirement obligations.\nSeptember 30, 2022\nProved properties\n$ 327,000\nAccumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and valuation allowance\n(292,000)\nNet capitalized cost\n$ 35,000\nII. Estimated Quantities of Reserves. Reed W. Ferrill & Associates, Inc., an independent engineering firm, prepared the Companys estimate of reserves, future production, and income. The estimated reserves include only those quantities that are expected to be commercially recoverable at prices and costs in effect at the balance sheet dates under existing regulations and with conventional operating methods. Proved, developed reserves represent only those reserves expected to be recovered from existing wells.\nOil in Barrels\nBalance at September 30, 2020\n1,100\nRevisions of previous estimates\nProduction\n(800)\nBalance at September 30, 2021\n1,000\nRevisions of previous estimates\nProduction\n(300)\nBalance at September 30, 2022\n1,300\nIII. Standardized Measure of Discounted Cash Flows. The standardized measure of discounted cash flows from the Companys oil and gas reserves is summarized below. Cash flows are discounted at an annual rate of 10%. This does not result in an estimate of fair market or present value. Prices are the average of the NYMEX settlement price on the first day of each month of the year, corrected to received price. Cash flows are computed by applying that price to estimated production, less estimated expenditures incurred in estimated production. Income tax expense is not included because of the anticipated utilization of net operating loss and depletion carryforwards. The estimation of reserves is complex and subjective, and reserve estimates fluctuate in light of new production data.\nAt September 30\nEstimated future revenue\n$ 110,000\n$ 51,000\nEstimated future expenditures\n(13,000)\n(6,000)\nEstimated future net revenue\n97,000\n45,000\n10% annual discount of estimated future net revenue\n(29,000)\n(12,000)\nPresent value of estimated future net revenue\n$ 68,000\n$ 33,000\nIV.
