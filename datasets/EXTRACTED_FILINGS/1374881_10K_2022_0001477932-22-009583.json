    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nBackground\nKingfish Holding Corporation (us, our, we, the Company, or Kingfish) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 11, 2006 as Offline Consulting Inc. On May 18, 2007, we entered into a reverse merger transaction pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement whereby we acquired Kesselring Corporation, a Florida corporation. Following the reverse merger we became Kesselring Holding Corporation (Kesselring Holding) on June 8, 2007. A Certificate of Ownership was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, effective as of June 8, 2007. On November 25, 2014, we changed our name to Kingfish Holding Corporation. The principal executive offices of the Company are located at 822 62nd Circle East, Unit 105, Bradenton, Florida 34208, and our telephone number is (941) 487-3653.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, the Company defaulted on its loan agreements with AMI Holdings, Inc., a corporation controlled by James K. Toomey, a shareholder, officer and director of the Company (Mr. Toomey), and certain of his relatives (AMI), and on May 24, 2010, AMI foreclosed on and took possession of all of the Companys then-existing operating entities. On September 16, 2011, the Company, having only 69 holders of record and no significant assets, filed a Form 15 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) to terminate the registration of its common shares under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and to suspend its reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.\nIn 2014, the Company took the steps necessary to reactivate its reporting obligations that had been suspended since 2011 under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (Reactivation Actions). The Company completed its Reactivation Actions and commenced its reactivated reporting obligations on December 17, 2014. However, the Company was unsuccessful in its endeavor to identify and engage in a business combination with a potential target company or business following its Reactivation Actions and, as of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, the Company had expended substantially all of its available cash and was unable to secure any additional funds to finance its operations. As a result, the Company was dormant from such date through May 2020.\nIn May 2020, the Company determined that the business environment had sufficiently changed so that identifying a target and completing a business combination may be more likely than was previously the case. As part of this strategy, the Company determined to attempt to seek the financing necessary to prepare and file all of its delinquent periodic reports on Form 10-K under the Exchange Act and to again aggressively pursue an acquisition target. In order for the Company to finance the preparation and filing of such delinquent periodic reports with the Commission, Mr. Toomey loaned the Company funds during the fiscal year ended 2020 and the first quarter of the 2021 fiscal year to finance such activities.\nOn March 2, 2022, the Company completed its filings with the Commission under the Exchange Act of all its delinquent periodic reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 through 2021, as well as Forms 10-Q for the most recently completed fiscal year ended (Filing Updates).\nBusiness Operations\nFollowing the completion of the Filing Updates, the Company engaged in the process of pursuing suitable private company candidates for a business combination with the goal of maximizing shareholder value. The Company was not been engaged in any business activities other than seek a business combination transaction.\nPrior to completing the Filing Updates, and as reported therein, the Company had entered into preliminary discussions regarding a potential business combination with Renovo Resource Solutions, Inc. (Renovo), a Florida corporation located in Manatee County, Florida, and 6, LLC, a Florida limited liability real estate holding company (6, LLC) controlled by Renovo which owns the land on which Renovo conducts its business (Renovo and 6 LLC, collectively the Renovo Group). However, Company had only commenced preliminary discussions with the Renovo Group as of the date of the Filing Updates and had not entered into a letter of intent or other arrangements with Renovo, and the Company also was analyzing other available alternatives and financing arrangements. The Company undertook due diligence and continued discussions with Renovo through the end of the September 30, 2022 fiscal year.\nRenovo, which was formed as a Florida corporation in 2014, is a privately held company engaged in an environmentally friendly scrap yard operation operating out of Manatee County Florida. Renovo has a scrap metal recycling license in the State of Florida and, as part of its business, it accepts certain metals from the public and then resells/recycles them to its customers. Renovos operations are located on a ten-acre site at 3324 63rd Avenue East, Bradenton, FL 34203. This location was specifically engineered for its business and includes a new constructed facility for its operations. Acceptable metals include aluminum, radiators, insulated aluminum wire, automotive components (rotors, drums etc. but not major components), insulated copper wire, copper, brass, electric motors, stainless steel, scrap iron, refrigerators, clothing dryers, aluminum cans, zinc, lead, batteries (lead acid), washing machines, and both ferrous and non-ferrous metals. The above is only a brief summary of Renovos business operation and does not purport to describe fully its operations. A more detailed description of the business and operations of Renovo will be furnished to stockholders of the Company if a merger transaction with Renovo should be presented to the Companys stockholders for their approval and, if consummated, such information will be included in a Form 8-K filed by the Company to report the closing of such merger transaction and the impact thereof on the Companys operations and financial statements.\nMr. Toomey, a director and officer of the Company, and his wife serve on the board of directors of Renovo and he and his family have a one-third equity ownership interest in Renovo.\nRecent Developments\nProposed Merger Transaction.\nOn October 28, 2022, the Company and Renovo entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) pursuant to which (i) Renovo will be merged with and into the Company (the Merger) in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL) and the separate corporate existence of Renovo shall thereupon cease, and (ii) the Company shall be the successor or surviving corporation in the Merger (the Surviving Corporation).\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (Effective Time), each outstanding common share, no par value, of Renovo (Renovo Stock) will be converted into and will represent the right to receive 7,200 shares (Exchange Ratio) of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (Company Stock), after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split (described below). The Exchange Ratio shall be fixed and no adjustment shall be made under any circumstances other than with respect to certain anti-dilution provision of the Merger Agreement. No fractional share of the Company Stock will be issued pursuant to the Merger. To the extent that a holder of Renovo Stock would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Company Stock (after taking into account all certificates delivered by such holder), such holder shall receive, in lieu thereof, an additional fraction of a share of the Company Stock rounded up to the nearest whole share of the Company Stock.\nThe Board of Directors of the Company, having determined that the Merger Agreement and the Merger are fair to, and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and resolved to recommend adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Companys stockholders.\nThe Company will seek stockholder approval of the Merger Agreement at the upcoming Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company (Annual Meeting). The Companys largest stockholder, James K. Toomey and his affiliates, beneficially own a total of 84,835,922 shares of Common Stock, or approximately 70.08% of the outstanding Common Stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, all of which are expected to be voted in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, if Mr. Toomey and his affiliates vote in favor of the Merger Agreement, the Merger Agreement will be approved without the need for any further vote of stockholders in favor of any proposals. Mr. Toomey is a director and executive officer of the Company. As a result of the foregoing the Company does not anticipate soliciting proxies for the Annual Meeting. However, the Company does anticipate preparing and disseminating an information statement to its stockholders prior to the Annual Meeting which describes the operations of Renovo and related financial information, the Merger Agreement, and the Merger transaction, as well as all other actions to be taken thereat.\nConsummation of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, including among others, the following: (i) approval of the Merger Agreement by Renovos stockholders, (ii) the Company, as the surviving corporation in the Merger, shall have been approved as a Secondary Metals Recycler under Section 538.25 of the Florida Statutes to be effective immediately following the closing of the Merger, (iii) the Company shall have entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit A to the Merger Agreement, with each of the Renovo shareholders, (iv) each of the Renovo shareholders shall have entered into an Investment Agreement which is attached as Exhibit B to the Merger Agreement, (v) there shall not have been any material adverse effects on the operations of Renovo, (vi) there shall not have been certain additional adverse legal proceedings commenced against the Company or Renovo which prevents the consummation of the Merger transactions, and (vii) the satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions.\nThe closing of the Merger transaction also is conditioned upon the Renovos acquisition of 6, LLC prior to the Closing by a merger transaction reasonably approved by the Company. 6, LLC owns the real property used by Renovo in conducting its business.\nIn addition to the conditions described above, the closing of the Merger transactions also are conditioned upon the approval and prior implementation of a an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the Amended Certificate) to effect (a) a 1-for 500 reverse stock split, such that every holder of the Companys Common Stock shall receive one share of the Companys Common Stock for every 500 shares of the Companys Common Stock held prior to such reverse stock split, and all fractional shares resulting therefrom will be rounded up to the nearest whole share; and (b) a corresponding reduction of the number of authorized shares of Companys Common Stock from 200,000,000 to 20,000,000 shares and the number of shares of Companys Preferred Stock from 20,000,000 to 2,000,000 shares (collectively, the Reverse Stock Split).\nThe Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made by Renovo, including, among other things, covenants (i) to conduct its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and consummation of the Merger and (ii) not to engage in certain kinds of transactions during such period. The Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights for both the Company and Renovo.\nIf the Merger Agreement is consummated, the Company has agreed to take the steps necessary at the effective time of the Merger to expand the size of the Board of Directors and to appoint the following shareholder of Renovo to the Companys board of directors to fill the vacancies created thereby: Randy Moritz, Keri Moritz, Brian Kendzior, and Lori Toomey.\nThe Merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023.\nIn order to close on the proposed Merger transaction, Renovo and the Company must prepare for filing with the Commission within four business days from the close of such Merger transaction, a Form 8-K that includes certain information relating to the post-Merger combined entities of the Company and Renovo Group as would be required in a Form 10 filed under the Exchange Act, including without limitation, all required disclosures concerning the post-Merger operations and management of the Company and all required consolidated and pro forma financial statements (Merger Form 8-K). The ability to prepare the Merger Form 8-K will be largely dependent on the ability of the Renovo Group to furnish the Company with audited financial statements and other information necessary to prepare such Merger Form 8-K. If the Renovo Group is unable to timely furnish such information to the Company, of which there is no assurance, the Merger Agreement may be terminated and the Merger transaction will not be consummated.\nAlthough the parties have executed the Merger Agreement, there is no assurance that the parties will be able to consummate a Merger transaction.\nThe foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 31, 2022.\nRenovo Loan Transaction\nUpon execution of the Merger Agreement, Renovo provided the Company with a loan in principal amount of $200,000 (the Renovo Loan), as evidenced by a promissory note (Renovo Promissory Note), to provide the funds necessary for the Company to continue operations and consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nBlank Check and Shell Company Status\nTo the extent that the Company should engage in the issuance of its stock, the Company may be considered to be a blank check company. The rules and regulations of the Commission defines blank check companies as any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Exchange Act and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies. Pursuant to Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Company also qualifies as a shell company, because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of blank check companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination transaction.\nIf the Merger transaction is consummated, the Company should no longer be classified as a shell company under the Commissions rules and the filing of the Merger Form 8-K should constitute the filing of current Form 10 Information under Rule 144(i)(2) and (3) and Instruction B.6. of Form S-3, each as promulgated by the Commission under the Securities Act.\nEmployees\nWe presently have no employees apart from our management. Our officers and directors are engaged in outside business activities and are employed on a full-time basis by certain unaffiliated companies. Our officers and directors will be dividing their time among these entities and anticipates that they will devote very limited time to our business until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. The specific amount of time that management will devote to the Company may vary from week to week or even day to day, and therefore the specific amount of time that management will devote to the Company on a weekly basis cannot be ascertained with any level of certainty. In all cases, management intends to spend as much time as is necessary to exercise its fiduciary duties as an officer and director of the Company and believes that it will be able to devote the time required to consummate a business combination transaction as necessary. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAs a Smaller Reporting Company, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nAs a Non-Accelerated Filer, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nThe Company neither rents nor owns any properties. The Company utilizes the office space and equipment of its Chief Financial Officer at no charge. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThere are presently no pending legal proceedings to which the Company, any of its subsidiaries, any executive officer, any owner of record or beneficially of more than five percent of any class of voting securities is a party or as to which any of its property is subject, and no such proceedings are known to the Company to be threatened or contemplated against it. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information\nPrice History. Our common shares are not traded on any exchange. Although there is no established trading market for our common shares, our common shares are quoted by the OTC Markets Group, Inc. on the pink sheets in their OTC Pink - No Information tier under the symbol KSSH. Trading in stocks quoted on these markets is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to factors that have little to do with a companys operations, or business, or prospects. There has only been limited and sporadic trading of our common shares following the suspension of our reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act on September 16, 2011 and since the reactivation of our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act on December 17, 2014. There is no assurance that an active trading market will ever develop for our common shares.\nThe following table sets forth high and low closing quotations for the quarters indicated. These quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission, and may not necessarily represent actual transactions.\nHigh\nLow\nYear Ended September 30, 2022:\nFirst Quarter (10/1/21 to 12/31/21)\n$ 0.0050\n$ 0.0000\nSecond Quarter (1/1/22 to 3/31/22)\n$ 0.0010\n$ 0.0010\nThird Quarter (4/1/22 to 6/30/22)\n$ 0.0029\n$ 0.0010\nFourth Quarter (7/1/22 to 9/30/22)\n$ 0.0033\n$ 0.0029\nYear Ended September 30, 2021:\nFirst Quarter (10/1/20 to 12/31/20)\n$ 0.0071\n$ 0.0027\nSecond Quarter (1/1/21 to 3/31/21)\n$ 0.0036\n$ 0.0023\nThird Quarter (4/1/21 to 6/30/21)\n$ 0.0056\n$ 0.0017\nFourth Quarter (7/1/21 to 9/30/21)\n$ 0.0050\n$ 0.0044\nThe numbers of holders of record of our common shares on December 16, 2022 was approximately 70. On December 16, 2022 the last reported sale price of our common shares as quoted by the OTC Markets Group, Inc. on the pink sheets in the OTC Pink - No Information tier was $0.0003 per share.\nThe trading volume in our common shares generally has been sporadic and extremely limited. The limited nature of the trading market can create the potential for significant changes in the trading price for our common shares as a result of relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for our common shares and perhaps without regard to our business activities. Because of the lack of specific transaction information and our belief that quotations during the period were particularly sensitive to actual or anticipated volume of supply and demand, we do not believe that such quotations during these periods are necessarily reliable indicators of a trading market for the common shares.\nImpact of Penny Stock Designation. Our common shares are designated as a penny stock under the Exchange Act, and the Commission has adopted rules which regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks (Rules 15g-2 through l5g-6 of the Exchange Act, which are referred to as the penny stock rules). Penny stocks generally are any non-Nasdaq equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions. The penny stock rules require a broker - dealer to: (a) deliver a standardized risk disclosure document established under the penny stock rules, (b) provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account, (c) make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser, and (d) receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure and other requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a stock that is subject to the penny stock rules. Since our common shares are subject to the penny stock rules, persons holding or receiving such shares may find it more difficult to sell their shares. The market liquidity for the shares could be severely and adversely affected by limiting the ability of broker-dealers to sell the shares and the ability of shareholders to sell their stock in any secondary market.\nRestrictions on the Use of Rule 144 by Shell Companies or Former Shell Companies. Historically, the Commissions staff has taken the position that Rule 144 is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by companies that are, or previously were, blank check companies, to their promoters or affiliates despite technical compliance with the requirements of Rule 144. The Commission has formalized and expanded this position in recent amendments to Rule 144 which prohibit the use of Rule 144 for resale of securities issued by any shell companies (other than business combination related shell companies) or any issuer that has been at any time previously a shell company. The Commission has provided an exception to this prohibition, however, if the following conditions are met:\n\u00b7\nthe issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company;\n\u00b7\nthe issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;\n\u00b7\nthe issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Form 8-K reports; and\n\u00b7\nat least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current Form 10 Information with the Commission reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company (which can be furnished on any other applicable form).\nAs a result, our existing shareholders will not be able to sell the shares pursuant to Rule 144 without registration until one year after we have completed our business combination and have satisfied the four conditions of a former shell company as described above.\nIf the Merger transaction is consummated, the Company should no longer be classified as a shell company under the Commissions rules and the filing of the Merger Form 8-K should constitute the filing of current Form 10 Information under Rule 144.\nDividends\nHolders of the Companys common shares are entitled to receive dividends when and if declared by its Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefore. The Company, however, has never declared any cash dividends on its common shares and does not anticipate the payment of cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We do not have earnings out of which to pay cash dividends. We may consider payment of dividends at some point in the future when and if we have earnings sufficient for that purpose, but the declaration of dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors, and there is no assurance that dividends will be paid at any time.\nSecurities Authorized under Equity Compensation Plans\nWe do not presently maintain any equity compensation plans.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nWe did not engage in any sales of unregistered securities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nTransfer Agent\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our common shares is Manhattan Transfer Registrar Co., whose address is 38B Sheep Pasture Road, Port Jefferson, New York 11777 and whose telephone number is 631-928-7655. ITEM 6. [Reserved] ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral\nThis Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the operating results and financial condition of the Company for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. The discussion and analysis set forth below is intended to assist you in understanding the financial condition and results of our operations and should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our results of operations and financial condition, as reflected in the accompanying statements and related notes, are subject to managements evaluation and interpretations of business conditions, changing market conditions and other factors. Historical results and trends that might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOperations. The Company has not conducted any substantial operations since May 24, 2010, the date on which AMI foreclosed on and took possession of all of the Companys then-existing operating entities other than those sold by the Company to an entity affiliated with Mr. King.\nDuring the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 and 2014, the Companys primary activities consisted of taking the steps necessary to reactivate its reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act that had been suspended since 2011 (referred to as the Reactivation Actions). On December 17, 2014, the Company completed its Reactivation Actions and recommenced its reporting obligations under the Exchange Act. However, the Company was unsuccessful in its endeavor to identify and engage in a business combination with a potential target company or business following its Reactivation Actions and, as of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, the Company had expended substantially all of its available cash and was unable to secure any additional funds to finance its operations. As a result, the Company was dormant from such date through May 2020.\nIn May 2020, the Company determined that the business environment had sufficiently changed so that identifying a target and completing a business combination may be more likely than was previously the case. As part of this strategy, the Company determined to attempt to seek the financing necessary to prepare and file its Filing Updates and to again aggressively pursue an acquisition target. In order for the Company to finance the preparation and filing of such delinquent periodic reports with the Commission, Mr. Toomey, a principal shareholder, director and secretary of the Company, loaned the Company funds during the fiscal year ended 2020 and the first quarter of the 2021 fiscal year to finance such activities.\nOn March 2, 2022, the Company completed its Filing Updates with the Commission under the Exchange Act of all its delinquent periodic reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 through 2021, as well as Forms 10-Q for the most recently completed fiscal year ended.\nFollowing the completion of the Filing Updates, the Company engaged in the process of pursuing suitable private company candidates for a business combination with the goal of maximizing shareholder value. The Company was not been engaged in any business activities other than seek a business combination transaction.\nPrior to completing the Filing Updates, the Company had entered into preliminary discussions regarding a potential business combination with Renovo. However, Company had only commenced preliminary discussions with the Renovo Group as of the date of the Filing Updates and had not entered into a letter of intent or other arrangements with Renovo. Further, the Company also was analyzing other available alternatives and financing arrangements. The Company undertook due diligence and continued discussions with Renovo through the end of the September 30, 2022 fiscal year.\nFinancial Condition. We did not record revenues from operations during the fiscal years covered by our financial statements included in this Form 10-K and are not currently engaged in any business activities that provide cash flows. We do not expect to generate any revenues over the next 12 months, unless we enter into and complete a business combination transaction, such as the Merger transaction, during that period of time. Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.\nWe have no specific plans, understandings or agreements with respect to the raising of such funds, and we may seek to raise the required capital by the issuance of equity or debt securities or by other means. Since we have no such arrangements or plans currently in effect, our inability to raise funds for the consummation of an acquisition may have a severe negative impact on our ability to become a viable company.\nWe have negative working capital, negative stockholders equity and have not earned any revenues from operations since the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011. Because we have had no revenues from operations and do not own any significant assets against which we can borrow funds, we historically had relied on funds furnished by Mr. Toomey, a principal shareholder, director and secretary of the Company, in exchange for issuances of our convertible debt securities in order to finance our operations following our Reactivation Actions. However, Mr. Toomey temporarily ceased financing our operations at the end of our 2016 fiscal year end.\nFollowing our determination that the business environment was once again favorable to pursue our strategy, Mr. Toomey again agreed to provide us with debt financing to recommence our operations. In order to fund our operations and proposed business activities through such time as we may consummate a merger or other business combination with a target company or business operation, we will need to continue to raise the required capital through the issuance of equity or debt securities or by other means. Although Mr. Toomey has provided us with additional debt financing since May 2020, we have no formal commitment that Mr. Toomey will continue to provide the Company with working capital sufficient until we consummate a merger or other business combination with a target company or business operation, and we anticipate that his willingness to provide additional financing will be dependent on our ability to demonstrate meaningful progress with our business strategy.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to develop additional sources of capital, locate and complete a merger with another company, and ultimately, achieve profitable operations.\nExcept as described in Subsequent Developments below, we have no specific plans, understandings or agreements with respect to the raising of any additional financings, and we may seek to raise the required capital by the issuance of equity or debt securities or by other means. Since we have no such arrangements or plans currently in effect (other than as described in Subsequent Developments below), our limited ability to raise funds to continue operations and to seek an acquisition may have a severely negative impact on our ability to become a viable company. Our historical operating results disclosed in this Form 10-K are not meaningful to our future results.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nRevenues. Because we currently do not have any business operations, we have not had any revenues during our fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.\nOperating Expenses. We had operating expenses of $185,000 and $89,777 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These expenses during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 primarily consisted of payments associated with maintaining our corporate status and expenses were incurred in connection with our professional fees to prepare and file certain of our delinquent SEC filings in connection with the Filing Updates. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, we also had $185,750 in expenses and professional fees incurred in connection with our due diligence of, and negotiations regarding a potential business combination with, the Renovo Group (Renovo Related Fees). The increase in such expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period ended September 30, 2021 primarily was due to such Renovo Related Fees.\nOther Expenses. We had interest expenses of $6,327 and $6,899 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The interest expenses in 2022 declined from those in 2021 due to reduced interest rates incurred on advances from related parties during 2022 as compared to 2021.\nNet Income (Loss). We recognized a net loss of $192,127 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to a net loss of $96,676 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in net loss was directly attributable to the payment of additional professional fees incurred in connection with the Filing Updates and the Renovo Related Fees incurred during the current fiscal year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had limited available cash resources and we had a working capital deficit of $324,191. Our current liabilities were $324,437 at September 30, 2022 and $350,341 at September 30, 2021. Total assets decreased to $ 246 as of September 30, 2022 from $38,277 as of September 30, 2021 due primarily to the additional expenses associated with the Renovo Related Fees in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nWe had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. However, if we are able to execute our business plan as anticipated in the future, including the consummation of the proposed Merger transaction with the Renovo Group described below and in Item 1. Business - Recent Developments - Proposed Merger Transaction, we would likely incur substantial capital expenditures and require additional financing to fund such expenditures.\nFollowing the completion of the Filing Updates, the Company borrowed $50,000 in aggregate principal amount from James K. Toomey, the Companys corporate secretary and a director, (the Toomey Loan). The Toomey Loan is evidenced by a consolidated promissory note, dated March 7, 2022, issued by the Company to Mr. Toomey (the 2022 Promissory Note). The 2022 Promissory Note bears interest, commencing on the date of the loan, at an initial rate of 2% per annum and the note matures on December 31, 2024. The maturity date of the 2022 Promissory Notes will accelerate and be due and payable immediately upon any change of control, merger, or other business combination (as defined in the 2022 Promissory Note). If the maturity date is extended for any reason whatsoever (including in connection with an acceleration event), the 2022 Promissory Note will bear interest at a rate of 5% per annum, commencing on the date of any such extension. The 2022 Promissory Note is not convertible into our common shares.\nThe proceeds of the Toomey Loan were used to pay outstanding amounts owed for professional services, to pay operating expenses, and to pursue the Companys acquisition strategy.\nBecause we do not have any revenues from operations, absent a merger or other business combination with an operating company or a public or private sale of our equity or debt securities, the occurrence of either of which cannot be assured, we will continue to be dependent upon future loans or equity investments from our present shareholders or management to fund operating shortfall and do not foresee a change in this situation in the immediate future. We will attempt to raise capital for our current operational needs through loans from related parties, debt financing, equity financing, or a combination of financing options. However, there are no existing undertakings, commitments, or agreements for any debt or equity financings and there is no assurance to that effect. Further, our need for capital may change dramatically if unknown claims or debts surface or if we acquire a business opportunity. There can be no assurances that any additional financings will be available to us on satisfactory terms and conditions, if at all. Unless we can obtain additional financing, our ability to continue as a going concern is doubtful.\nAlthough Mr. Toomey has provided the necessary funds for the Company from time to time in the past, there is no existing commitment to provide additional capital and he is unlikely to fund the Company to pay for any claims made against the Company for substantial debts or other obligations. In such situation, there can be no assurance that we shall be able to receive additional financing, and if we are unable to receive sufficient additional financing upon acceptable terms, it is likely that our business would cease operations or, at the very least, cease to be a reporting Company under the Exchange Act.\nHowever, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement as discussed in -Subsequent Developments below, Renovo provided the Company with a $200,000 loan to assist in the funding of ongoing operations pending the consummation of the proposed Merger transaction.\nSubsequent Developments\nOn October 28, 2022, the Company and Renovo entered into the Merger Agreement, as discussed in greater detail in Item 1. Business - Recent Developments - Proposed Merger Transaction, pursuant to which Renovo will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company being the legal successor or surviving corporation in the Merger.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Renovo loaned $200,000 in principal amount to the Company on October 28, 2022 (referred to as the Renovo Loan). The Renovo Loan is evidenced by a consolidated promissory note, dated October 28, 2022, issued by the Company to Renovo (referred to as the Renovo Promissory Note)\nThe Renovo Promissory Note bears interest, commencing on the date of the loan, at an initial rate of 6% per annum and the note matures on October 28, 2024. No payments of principal or interest are due prior to the maturity date and on such date all such amounts are payable in full. The Company may prepay the amounts owed under the Renovo Promissory Note at any time without any prepayment penalties. In the event of a default by the Company under the Renovo Promissory Note, the outstanding principal amount, accrued and unpaid interest, and all other amounts payable under the Renovo Promissory Note shall become immediately due and payable without notice, declaration, or other act on the part of the Renovo.\nThe proceeds of the Renovo Loan have been used to provide the funds necessary for the Company to continue operations and consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions and apply judgments.\nIn its report dated December 30, 2022, our auditors, Accell Audit & Compliance P.A., expressed an opinion that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We generated no operating revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, and at September 30, 2022, we had a stockholders deficit of $524,191. Furthermore, at September 30, 2022 and 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $4,894,498 and $4,702,371, respectively, and a working capital deficit of $324,191 at September 30, 2022. As a result of our working capital deficiency and anticipated operating costs for the next twelve months, we do not have sufficient funds available to sustain our operations for a reasonable period without additional financing. Our continuation as a going concern is therefore dependent upon future events, including our ability to close the proposed Merger transaction or raise additional capital and to generate positive cash flows.\nWe base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the financial statements are prepared; actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material. We have identified below the critical accounting policies, which are assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain and that are of critical importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation of our financial statements.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets, if any, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nIncome Taxes. Deferred taxes are provided on the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Future tax benefits for net operating loss carry forwards are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10 Uncertainty in Income Taxes (ASC 740-10). A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits has not been provided since there are not unrecognized benefits for all periods presented. The Company has not recognized interest expense or penalties as a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10. If there were an unrecognized tax benefit, the Company would recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefit in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses.\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share. Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period of computation. Diluted loss per share gives effect to potentially dilutive common shares outstanding. The Company gives effect to these dilutive securities using the Treasury Stock Method. Potentially dilutive securities also include other convertible financial instruments. The Company gives effect to these dilutive securities using the If-Converted-Method.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our financial statements, see Note 8: Recent Accounting Pronouncement in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAs a Smaller Reporting Company, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (ID #3289)\nBalance Sheets\nStatements of Operations\nStatements of Changes in Stockholders Deficit\nStatements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Financial Statements\n21-25\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and\nStockholders of Kingfish Holding Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Kingfish Holding Corporation (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nSubstantial Doubt about the Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and negative operating cash flows since inception. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there were no critical audit matters.\n/s/ Accell Audit & Compliance, P.A.\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2020.\nTampa, Florida\nDecember 30, 2022\n3001 N.

It became Kesselring Holding Corporation on June 8, 2007 and on November 25, 2014 it changed its name to Kingfish Holding Corporation.\nThe Company terminated the registration of its common stock under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and the suspension of its reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act in September 2011.\nOn December 17, 2014, the Company reactivated its suspended reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act by filing a Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 and Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended December 31, 2013, March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014. The Companys activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional funding to reorganize and finding a suitable candidate to participate in its renewable energy initiatives.\n2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies:\nBasis of presentation:\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC and reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which management believes are necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nUse of estimates:\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, if any at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nCash:\nCash is maintained at a financial institution and, at times, the balance may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has never experienced any losses related to the balance. Currently, the FDIC provides insurance coverage up to $250,000 per depositor at each financial institution and the Companys cash balance did not exceed such coverage on September 30, 2022.\nFor purpose of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments:\nThe carrying amounts of cash and current liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these items. These fair value estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates. Management does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes, nor does the Company utilize derivative instruments in the management of the Companys foreign exchange, commodity price or interest rate market risks.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Codification clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. It also requires disclosure about how fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a hierarchy for which these assets and liabilities must be grouped, based on significant levels of inputs as follows:\nLevel 1:\nQuoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\nLevel 2:\nQuoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability\nLevel 3:\nUnobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe determination of where assets and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nRevenue Recognition:\nThe Company recognizes revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and all related interpretations for recognition of our revenue from services. Revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met:\n\u00b7\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer;\n\u00b7\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u00b7\ndetermination of the transaction price;\n\u00b7\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u00b7\nrecognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy the performance obligation.\nIncome Taxes:\nDeferred taxes are provided on the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Future tax benefits for net operating loss carry forwards are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10 Uncertainty in Income Taxes (ASC 740-10). A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits has not been provided since there are no unrecognized benefits for all periods presented. The Company has not recognized interest expense or penalties as a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10. If there were an unrecognized tax benefit, the Company would recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefit in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses.\nNet income (loss) per share:\nBasic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period of computation. Diluted loss per share gives effect to potentially dilutive common shares outstanding. The Company gives effect to these dilutive securities using the If-Converted Method. Potentially dilutive securities include convertible financial instruments.\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, convertible notes payable to related party of $90,000 can potentially convert into 90,000 shares of common stock. Interest expense related to the convertible notes was immaterial. These shares have been excluded from the diluted net loss per share calculations because the effect of including them would be anti-dilutive, at September 30, 2022 and 2021.\n3.\nGoing Concern:\nAs reflected in the Companys financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $4,894,498 and $4,702,371 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company used cash of $88,031 and $89,777 in operating activities during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company has a working capital deficiency of $324,191 at September 30, 2022 that is insufficient in managements view to sustain current levels of operations for a reasonable period without additional financing. These trends and conditions continue to raise substantial doubt surrounding the Companys ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period. Ultimately, the Companys ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon managements ability to continue to curtail current operating expense and obtain additional financing to augment working capital requirements and support acquisition plans. There can be no assurance that management will be successful in achieving these objectives or obtain financing under terms and conditions that are suitable. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments associated with these uncertainties.\n4.\nConvertible Notes Payable to Related Party:\nThe Company entered into a convertible note with a director for $20,000 effective December 7, 2015. The note bears interest at a rate of 3.5% per annum and all unpaid principal and interest are due on demand by the director. The outstanding principal balance of the note is convertible into the Companys shares of common stock at the conversion price of $1.00 per share.\nThe Company entered into a convertible note with a director for $20,000 effective March 3, 2016.

The outstanding principal balance of the note is convertible into the Companys shares of common stock at the conversion price of $1.00 per share.\nThe Company entered into a convertible note with a director for $30,000 effective July 11, 2016. The note bears interest at a rate of 3.5% per annum and all unpaid principal and interest are due on demand by the director. The outstanding principal balance of the note is convertible into the Companys shares of common stock at the conversion price of $1.00 per share.\nThe Company entered into a convertible note with a director for $20,000 effective September 19, 2016. The note bears interest at a rate of 3.5% per annum and all unpaid principal and interest are due on demand by the director. The outstanding principal balance of the note is convertible into the Companys shares of common stock at the conversion price of $1.00 per share.\nBased on the Companys stock price at the respective commitments dates, the Company determined that the above convertible notes did not have a beneficial conversion feature to the note holder.\n5.\nNotes Payable to Related Party:\nThe Company entered into a note to convert prior advances in a note payable with Mr. Toomey, a director, for $130,000 effective February 1, 2021. The note bears interest, commencing on the date of the loan, at an initial rate of 2% per annum and the note matures on December 31, 2023. The maturity date of the note will accelerate and be due and payable immediately upon any change of control, merger, or other business combination (as defined in the note). If the maturity date is extended for any reason whatsoever (including in connection with an acceleration event), the note will bear interest at a rate of 5% per annum, commencing on the date of any such extension. The note is not convertible into the Companys common shares.\nThe Company entered into a note with Mr. Toomey, a director, for $50,000 effective March 7, 2022. The note bears interest, commencing on the date of the loan, at an initial rate of 2% per annum and the note matures on December 31, 2024. The maturity date of the note will accelerate and be due and payable immediately upon any change of control, merger, or other business combination (as defined in the note). If the maturity date is extended for any reason whatsoever (including in connection with an acceleration event), the note will bear interest at a rate of 5% per annum, commencing on the date of any such extension. The note is not convertible into the Companys common shares.\n6.\nPreferred Stock:\nThe Company is authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time to time by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue Preferred Stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our Common Stock. The terms of the preferred stock have not been approved. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, there was no Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.\n7.\nIncome Taxes:\nThe Companys provision (benefit) for income taxes was as follows:\n9/30/2022\n9/30/2021\nCurrent\nFederal\n$ -\n$ -\nState\n-\n-\nForeign\n-\n-\n-\n-\nDeferred\nFederal\n(35,462 )\n(17,844 )\nState\n(4,885 )\n(2,458 )\nTotal\n$ (40,347 )\n$ (20,302 )\nThe income tax provision differs from the amount of tax determined by applying the Federal statutory rate as follows:\n9/30/2022\n9/30/2021\nIncome tax provision at statutory rate:\n$ (40,347 )\n$ (20,302 )\nIncrease (decrease) in income tax due to:\nChange in Valuation Allowance\n40,347\n20,302\n$ -\n$ -\nNet deferred tax assets and liabilities were comprised of the following:\n9/30/2022\n9/30/2021\nLong-term deferred tax assets (liabilities)\nNet Operating Loss\n$ 652,600\n$ 612,253\nValuation Allowance\n(652,600 )\n(612,253 )\n$ -\n$ -\nThe tax benefit for the period presented is offset by a valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets arising from operating losses and other temporary differences, the realization of which could not be considered more likely than not. In future periods, tax benefits and related tax deferred assets will be recognized when management considers realization of such amounts to be more likely than not.\nThe Companys earliest tax year remains subject to examination by all tax jurisdictions was September 30, 2016.\n8.\nRescission Liability:\nOn November 20, 2009, the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of its common stock to pay for services valued at $20,000. The issuance of these shares was declared invalid by the court since they were issued by prior management who did not have the authority to do so since they were validly removed on November 16, 2009. These shares remained outstanding at September 30, 2022 and will be returned to the Companys transfer agent upon locating the holder of these shares.\n9.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements:\nRecent pronouncements issued by FASB, the American institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the SEC did not have a material impact on the Companys present or future financial statements.\n10.\nCommitments and Contingencies:\nDuring the normal course of business, the Company may be exposed to litigation. When the Company becomes aware of potential litigation, it evaluates the merits of the case in accordance with FASB ASC 450-20-50, Contingencies. The Company evaluates its exposure to the matter, possible legal or settlement strategies and the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome. If the Company determines that an unfavorable outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated, it establishes the necessary accruals. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company is not aware of any contingent liabilities that should be reflected in the financial statements.\n11.\nSubsequent Events:\nOn October 28, 2022, the Company and Renovo Resource Solutions, Inc. (Renovo), a Florida corporation, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), pursuant to which Renovo will be merged with and into the Company (the Merger), with the Company being the legal successor or surviving corporation in the Merger. Consummation of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, including among others approval of the Merger Agreement by Renovos stockholders, the Company shall have been approved as a Secondary Metals Recycler under Section 538.25 of the Florida Statutes to be effective immediately following the closing of the Merger, and the satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Renovo loaned $200,000 in principal amount to the Company on October 28, 2022 (referred to as the \"Renovo Loan\"). The Renovo Loan is evidenced by a promissory note, dated October 28, 2022, issued by the Company to Renovo. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNot Applicable. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nControls and Procedures\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commissions rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based upon that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in providing reasonable assurance in timely alerting management to material information relating to the Company and that information required to be disclosed in our reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported as required to be included in our periodic filings with the Commission.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our sole officer and employee to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the Companys transactions; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements and that receipts and expenditures of the Companys assets are made in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the Companys financial statements would be prevented or detected.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 15d-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) based on the framework in its Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework).\nBased on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2022 because of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entitys financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. Our management concluded that the Company has several material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting because of inadequate segregation of duties over authorization due to the lack of employees for this purpose, lack of sufficient documentation concerning our review, risk assessment, and recording of transactions, as well as the financial reporting of such transactions.\nDue to the Companys limited resources and staffing, management has not developed a plan to mitigate the above material weaknesses. Despite the existence of these material weaknesses, the Company believes the financial information presented herein is materially correct and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nNo system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of controls are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that the system of controls has operated effectively in all cases. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Companys registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report is not subject to attestation by the Companys registered public accounting firm because the Company is not an accelerated filer under the Exchange Act.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation. There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nDirectors and Executive Officers\nThe directors and executive officers of the Company, their ages, and positions with the Company as of September 30, 2022 are set forth below.\nName\nAge\nPosition with Company\nTed Sparling\nDirector, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nJames K. Toomey\nDirector and Secretary\nJames M. La Manna\nDirector and Chief Financial Officer\nAll directors of the Company hold office until the earlier of the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified, or their death, resignation, or removal. Officers are elected annually by the respective Boards of Directors of the Company to hold office until the earlier of their death, resignation, or removal.\nSet forth below is a description of the business experience during the past five years or more and other biographical information of the directors and executive officers of the Company.\nTed Sparling has served as the President, Chief Executive Officer, and a director of the Company since January 2012. Mr. Sparling also served as Chief Executive Officer and Secretary from January 2012 until November 2014, and as the President of the Kesselring Corporation, a Florida corporation, from March 2005 (prior to its acquisition by the Company pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, dated May 18, 2007) until October 2007 when the Shares Exchange Agreement was consummated. Mr. Sparling also has served as the President and sole director of Gulf & Bay Constructors, Inc., a building contractor located in west central Florida, since December 2006 and has served in the same capacities for Gulf & Bay Inspections, Inc., a building inspector located in west central Florida, since January 2007. Mr. Sparling has been a state certified building contractor since 1989 and has been a state certified home inspector since 2012.\nMr. Sparlings prior experiences as the President and CEO of the predecessor company provides important background and institutional knowledge about the Company.\nJames K. Toomey has served as Secretary of the Company since November 14, 2014. He was appointed to serve as a director of the Company on August 31, 2013. Mr. Toomey also had served as a director of the Company from 2006 to 2008. Mr. Toomey has served on the board of directors of Research Development and Manufacturing, Inc., a privately held engineering and bio-tech firm, since 2016.

He also served as a director of Coast Bank of Florida, a Florida state-chartered bank (Coast Bank), from its inception in April 2000 through the sale of the bank in December 2007 as part of the Coast Merger Transaction. Upon formation of Coast Financial as a bank holding company in 2003, Coast Bank became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coast Financial. Prior to 2003, Coast Bank was operated as a stand-alone banking institution. Previously, Mr. Toomey served in various positions for Knight-Ridder/Bradenton Herald from August 1990 to September 1997. Since September 1997, Mr. Toomeys business interests have been focused towards commercial shopping development and investments. He is the co-owner of four real estate investment companies (including, Braden River Industries, Inc., a Florida corporation and real estate holding company, and AMI Holdings, Inc., a commercial real estate holding company), a retail clothing company (Two Sides of Nature), and an ice cream store (Two Scoops). Mr. Toomey also has served as a director and co-manager of Renovo Resource Solutions, Inc. (referred to as Renovo), a metal recycling company, since September 2015. In addition, he founded the Toomey Foundation for the Natural Sciences in 2000, a not-for-profit organization for the preservation and education of archeological, paleontological and geological resources. He also has served as a trustee of the Sarasota Marine Safety Foundation, a not-for-profit entity, since 2019 and has been an officer of the Coast Guard Auxiliary since 2008. Mr. Toomey received his MBA from Crummer Graduate School, Rollins College in 1990 and his Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics from Rollins in 1988.\nMr. Toomeys prior experience as a director and Chairman of the Board of a public company and a member of its audit committee will be beneficial to the Company as it reactivates it reporting obligations under the Exchange Act. He understands the disclosure responsibilities and duties owed to shareholders of public companies and can provide his public company experience to the board of directors.\nJames M. La Manna, CPA has served as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company since November 14, 2014 and as a director of the Company since September 13, 2013. Mr. La Manna is a certified public accountant and has served as the Chief Executive Officer and sole owner of James M. La Manna, CPA, PA, an accounting firm, since 2007. Mr. La Manna has been a licensed Florida certified accountant since 1998 and prior to opening his own firm, he had most recently served as a supervising auditor for Aidman Piser, an accounting firm, in 2006 and as a supervising audit and tax partner for Christopher Smith Leonard, an accounting firm, from 2003 - 2006.\nMr. La Mannas experience as a CPA and his qualifications as a potential audit committee financial expert are invaluable skills needed by the Company as it seeks to carry out its business plan.\nFamily Relationships\nThere are no family relationships between any of directors or executive officers of the Company.\nInvolvement in Certain Legal Proceedings\nDuring the past ten years, none of our directors, executive officers, promoters, or control persons has been involved in any of the legal proceedings listed in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K.\nArrangements for Selection of Directors\nThere are no current arrangements or understandings between an executive officer, director, and any other person pursuant to which he was or is to be elected or selected as a director or as an executive officer of the Company.\nDirectorships\nNone of the Companys directors currently is a director of, or during the past 5 years has held any directorship in, any other company with a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act or subject to the requirements of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.\nCode of Conduct and Ethics\nAlthough prior to the filing of its Form 15 with the Commission on September 16, 2011, the Company had previously disclosed in its filings with the Commission that it had adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct for Officers, Directors and Employees, our current management is not familiar with any such Code of Ethics and, to ensure that there are no inadvertent violations thereof, the board of directors has rescinded any and all such existing codes. Although the Company has initially determined to prepare and approve a new Code of Ethics, this was delayed and will be addressed in the future when the Company has additional resources to commit to such endeavors. Accordingly, the Company does not currently have a Code of Ethics.\nCertain Corporate Governance Matters\nThe Board of Directors has established a standing Compensation Committee, but has not established or reinstated any audit or other committees of the board. With the exception of our Compensation Committee, the functions of audit, nominating committees, and any committees forming similar functions are instead being undertaken by our full board of directors and, as a result, the entire board of directors is responsible for the full oversight of the non-compensation affairs of the Company, including the assessment and oversight of the Companys financial risk exposure.\nCompensation Committee. The Compensation Committee is comprised solely of Mr. Toomey, and it did not hold any meetings during fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The Compensation Committee does not have a charter. However, principal responsibilities of this committee are to review and make recommendations to the Board of Directors concerning the compensation of officers of the Company, to provide input and make recommendations to the Board on individuals elected to be executive officers of the Company, to review and make recommendations with respect to the Companys existing and proposed compensation and bonus plans, and to serve as the committee responsible for administering the Companys existing compensation and benefits plans. In addition, this committee also is responsible for evaluating and recommending compensation to be paid to our directors, including retainers, fees, benefits and perquisites. The sole member of this Committee is not independent within the meaning of the listing standards of the Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2)(A).\nShareholder Nominees of Directors. Currently, we do not have a policy regarding the consideration of any director candidates that may be recommended by our shareholders, including the minimum qualifications for director candidates, nor has our sole director established a process for identifying and evaluating director nominees. Furthermore, given our size and lack of operations, we do not have a diversity policy as it relates to the make-up and composition of our directors who serve on the board. We also have not adopted a policy regarding the handling of any potential recommendation of director candidates by our shareholders, including the procedures to be followed. To date, no shareholders have recommended any persons to be nominated for election to our board of directors. Given our relative size and lack of directors and officers insurance coverage, we do not anticipate that any of our shareholders will make such a recommendation in the near future. While there have been no nominations of additional directors proposed, in the event such a proposal is made, all current members of our Board would participate in the consideration of director nominees.\nCompliance with Section 16 of the Exchange Act\nThe completion of our Reactivation Actions in the 2015 fiscal year resulted in the reactivation of the Companys reporting obligations solely under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act which had been suspended since 2011. Accordingly, the Companys securities are not registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and, as a result, the reporting obligations of Section 16 of the Exchange Act do not apply to the Company. ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nCompensation of Executive Officers\nThe Company did not pay any officer or any other person any compensation for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 or 2021 and none of our executive officers has an employment agreement with the Company. Furthermore, as of September 30, 2022, none of our executive officers have any outstanding equity awards in his capacity as an employee with respect to the Companys common stock.\nDirector Compensation\nNone of the Companys directors received any cash compensation, equity awards, or other non-cash compensation or other arrangements for services provided in their capacity as directors for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCK HOLDER MATTERS\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of the Companys outstanding common shares as of December 16, 2022 by: (a) each person known by us to beneficially own 5% or more of the Companys common shares, (b) each director of the Company and each executive officer of the Company, and (c) all directors and executive officers of the Company as a group.

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, no individual grants of stock options, whether or not in tandem with stock appreciation rights known as SARs or freestanding SARs were made to our directors or executive officers and, as of September 30, 2022, none of our directors or our executive offices have been granted, or held, any stock options or other equity award to acquire any of our capital stock.

These promissory notes remain outstanding and are convertible into our common stock at a fixed conversion price equal to $1.00 per share (subject to anti-dilution adjustments).\nIn addition to the above loans, Mr. Toomey also: (a) advanced an aggregate of $130,000 to the Company during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, evidenced by a consolidated promissory note, dated February 1, 2021, bearing interest at an initial rate of 2% per annum and maturing on December 31, 2023 and (b) loaned $50,000 in aggregate principal amount to the Company following the completion of the Filing Updates, evidenced by a promissory note, dated March 7, 2022, bearing interest at an initial rate of 2% per annum and maturing on December 31, 2024.

Mr. Toomey, his wife, and his daughter serve on the board of directors of Renovo, and he and his family have a one-third equity ownership interest in Renovo.\nDirector Independence\nAlthough there is no established trading market for our common shares, limited and sporadic trading of our common shares is quoted by the OTC Markets Group, Inc. on the pink sheets in the OTC Pink - No Information tier, which does not have director independence requirements or defines who would constitute an independent director. We, however, undertook a review of the independence of our directors using the independence standards for directors provided in the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market. These rules require consideration of whether any director has a material relationship with us that could interfere with his ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities. Under Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2), however, a director is not considered to be independent if he or she, among other things:\n\u00b7\nis, or has been within the past three years, an executive officer or employee of the Company.\n\u00b7\nhas accepted or who has an immediate family member who has accepted, with limited exceptions thereto, any compensation from the Company in excess of $120,000 during any period of twelve consecutive months within the three years preceding the determination of independence.\n\u00b7\nhas an immediate family member who is, or at any time during the past three years was, employed by the Company as an executive officer.\n\u00b7\nexcept under specified limited circumstances, is, or has an immediate family member who is, a partner in, or a controlling shareholder or an executive officer of, any organization to which the Company made, or from which the Company received, payments for property or services in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5% of the recipients consolidated gross revenues for that year, or $200,000, whichever is more.\n\u00b7\nis or has been, or has an immediate family member who is or has been, within the last three years, employed as an executive officer of another company where any of the Companys present executive officers at the same time serves or served on the other companys compensation committee.\n\u00b7\nis, or has an immediate family member who is , a current partner of the Companys outside auditor, or was a partner or employee of the Companys outside auditor who worked on the Companys audit at any time during any of the past three years.\nUnder such definition, as of September 30, 2022, none of our directors could be classified as independent. Each of our directors are considered a non-independent director because of their appointment as executive officers of the Company. ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES\nThe firm of Accell Audit & Compliance, P.A., an independent registered public accounting firm (AAC), has served as the Companys auditors for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2022.\nAudit and Non-Audit Fees\nThe following table presents fees for professional audit services rendered by AAC for the audit of the Companys annual financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2022 and fees billed for other services rendered by AAC during this period.\nAudit fees (1)\n$ 30,000 $ 30,000\nAudit related fees (2)\n$ 0\n$ 0\nTax fees (3)\n$ 0\n$ 0\nAll other fees (4)\n$ 0\n$ 0\n_______________________\n(1)\nAudit fees consistent principally of audit work performed on the financial statements, as well as work generally only the independent auditors can reasonably be expected to provide, such as statutory audits.\n(2)\nAudit related fees consisted principally of an attestation report on managements report on internal controls, a review of our Form 10-Qs and related press releases, and other general miscellaneous matters.\n(3)\nTax fees consisted principally of assistance with tax compliance, preparation of returns, tax planning, and providing tax guidance.\n(4)\nConsist of fees for products and services provided by our principal accountants, other than services reported under Audit fees, Audit related fees, or Tax fees.\nPART IV ITEM 15.
