The warrants will vest quarterly over a 24-month period.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\nWe regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in note (1) of the notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.\nAccrued Payroll Taxes\nThe total balance for Federal Accrued Payroll Taxes is accumulated on a quarterly basis beginning on their respective quarterly filing dates. Accrued Interest is compounded daily at an Effective Annual Interest Rate of approximately seven percent. The individual quarterly sub-totals have a calculated expiration date of Ten years according to the Internal Revenue Service statute of limitations. This timeline can be extended as a result of bankruptcy or other legal action that is filed by the Company (Code 520 per IRS Federal Account Transcripts). Code 520 effectively stops the clock for the Statute of limitations until the Bankruptcy or other legal action has been removed (Code 521 per IRS Federal Account Transcripts). In addition to the number of days between Code 520 and 521, every Code 520 automatically extends the IRS Statute of limitations by 30 days. As the quarterly sub-totals surpass their respective Calculated Expiration Date the Company removes the liability from the Consolidated Balance Sheets and an equivalent amount is recognized as Gain on expiration of accrued payroll taxes on the Statements of Operations. The amount owing may be subject to additional late filing fees and penalties that are not quantifiable as at the date of these consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes and accounts for revenue in accordance with ASC 606 as a principal on the sale of goods and services. Pursuant to ASC 606, revenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to the potential impacts arising from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and related public and private sector policies and initiatives. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. A couple key categories that use estimates are Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Impairment.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value using quoted market prices of the equity instruments issued.\nBusiness Combination\nASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations to all acquisitions where the acquirer gains a controlling interest, regardless of whether consideration was exchanged. ASC 805 establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: a) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; b) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and c) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. Accounting for acquisitions requires the Company to recognize, separately from goodwill, the assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, the estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (ASC 350). ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives should be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (June 30 for the Company) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company considers its market capitalization and the carrying value of its assets and liabilities, including goodwill, when performing its goodwill impairment test. When conducting its annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company initially performs a qualitative evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. If it is determined by a qualitative evaluation that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, the Company then applies a two-step impairment test. The two-step impairment test first compares the fair value of the Company's reporting unit to its carrying or book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company determines the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. There was impairment of goodwill in the amount of $218,308 as of June 30, 2022.\nAn intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. Such an asset is identifiable when it is separable, or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights. Separable assets can be sold, transferred, licensed, etc. Examples of intangible assets include computer software, licenses, trademarks, patents, films and copyrights. The Companys intangible assets are finite lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nUpon the completion of a business combination, the consideration transferred as well as the assets and liabilities acquired must be recorded at their acquisition date fair values. Upon identification of the acquirer and determination of the acquisition date, business combinations are accounted for through the preparation of a Purchase Price Allocation (PPA). We take into consideration the five steps when completing a PPA:\nStep 1: Determine the fair value of consideration paid;\nStep 2: Revalue all existing assets and liabilities (excluding intangible assets and goodwill which are addressed in step 3 to 5 below) to their acquisition date fair values;\nStep 3: Identify the intangible assets acquired;\nStep 4: Determine the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired; and,\nStep 5: Allocate the remaining consideration to goodwill and assess the reasonableness of the overall\nRelated Party Transactions\nRelated party transactions are conducted with parties with which DFCO has a close association, such as majority owned subsidiaries, its executive, managers, and their families. The types of transactions that can be conducted between related parties are many, such as sales, asset transfers, leases, lending arrangements, guarantees, allocations of common costs, and the filing of consolidated tax returns. DFCO discloses any transaction that would impact the decision making of the users of a companys financial statements. This involves the following disclosures:\n\u00b7 General. DFCO discloses all material related party transactions, including the nature of the relationship, the nature of the transactions, the dollar amounts of the transactions, the amounts due to or from related parties.\n\u00b7 Receivables. DFCO separately discloses any receivables from officers, employees, or affiliated entities.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The amendments in this Update simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted this pronouncement on July 1, 2020, and there was not a material impact on the financial statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity, as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among other changes, the new guidance removes from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated into a debt and equity component, unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the debt is issued at a substantial premium. As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded conversion features in equity, and will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of the if-converted method when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent with the Companys current accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company adopted this pronouncement on July 1, 2021.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08 - Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2021-08). Under current accounting standards, contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination are to be recorded at fair value using the ASC 805 measurement principle. ASU 2021-08 requires the acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers as if the acquirer had originated the contracts rather than at fair value. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2021-08 on a prospective basis as of July 1, 2021. The election to use practical expedients allowed under ASU 2021-08 will be applied on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. There was no impact to the Companys consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date.\nWe have reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company.\nContractual Obligations\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nNot applicable to smaller reporting companies. Item 8. Financial Statements\nDALRADA FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nFor the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders Deficit\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and\nStockholders of Dalrada Financial Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dalrada Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (collectively the Company) as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has had recurring losses, used cash flows from operating activities and has a significant working capital deficit, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRelated Party Transactions including Revenue Recognition\nDescription of the Matter:\nAs discussed in Notes 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has significant related party transactions involving revenue, accounts receivable, accounts payable, loans payable, advances, and expenses paid by and to multiple related parties. Our auditing of managements identification of related parties and the related transactions including recognition of revenue was complex and is based on a thorough understanding the Companys related party relationships, contracts, and business activities. These were the principal considerations that led us to determine this as a critical audit matter.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in our Audit:\nWe evaluated the controls over the Companys identification of, and recording of related party transactions, and of the revenue recognition process, including walkthroughs of internal controls. We confirmed certain balances and transactions with related parties. To evaluate the related partys satisfaction of performance obligations, our audit procedures included, among others, reviewing contracts and evaluating managements assumptions used to determine the distinct performance obligations, and reviewing the branding work performed by the Company for various products. In addition, to identify undisclosed related party transactions we performed the following: 1) made inquiries of management and other individuals throughout the Company; 2) obtained a selection of expenses and reviewed for related party indicators; 3) reviewed public filings and other online information available; 4) confirmed with the transfer agent regarding significant shareholders; and 5) related procedures performed in other parts of the audit engagement.\nRevenue Recognition\nDescription of the Matter:\nAs disclosed in Note 2, 9 and 12, the Company recognizes revenue when or as the Company satisfies a customer agreement performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. In determining revenue recognition for certain customer agreements, significant judgment was exercised by the Company, and included the following: 1) An assessment of the products and services promised in contracts or customer agreements, and the identification of a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a product or service that is distinct. 2) Determination of relative standalone selling price for distinct performance obligations. 3) The timing of product or service delivery for performance obligations. 4) Net revenues and accounts receivable recognized from healthcare insurers and government payers consist of amounts billed net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive from such payers, which considers historical denial and collection experience and, additionally for healthcare insurers, the terms of the Companys contractual arrangements. As disclosed by management, the process for estimating revenues and the ultimate collection of receivables associated involves significant assumptions and judgments. Given these factors, the related audit effort in evaluating managements judgments in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive, which led us to determine this as a critical audit matter.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in our Audit:\nOur principal audit procedures related to the Companys revenue recognition for these customer agreements included an evaluation of the controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations and the determination of the timing of revenue recognition. We also evaluated managements significant accounting policies related to certain customer agreements. In addition, we selected customer agreements and performed the following procedures: 1) Obtained and read the customer agreements or contracts for each selected agreement. 2) Evaluated and tested managements identification of significant terms for completeness, including the identification of distinct performance obligations. 3) Evaluated the appropriateness of managements application of their accounting principles, in their determination of revenue recognition conclusions. 4) Tested the mathematical accuracy of managements calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the consolidated financial statements. 5) These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for developing the estimate for contractual allowances, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the historical contractual allowance and collection data from the Companys billing system, which is an input to the methodology, and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of managements assumptions used to estimate contractual allowances (net accounts receivable).\n/s/ dbbmckennon\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2019.\nSan Diego, California\nOctober 31, 2022\nPCAOB No. 3501\nDALRADA FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nJune 30, June 30,\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 772,062 $ 110,285\nAccounts receivable, net 6,406,555 265,812\nAccounts receivable, net -

Organization and Nature of Operations\nDalrada Financial Corporation, (Dalrada), was incorporated in September 1982 under the laws of the State of California. It was reincorporated in May 1983 under the laws of the State of Delaware and reincorporated again on May 5, 2020, under the laws of the state of Wyoming.

(HQ), a United Kingdom company (Likido). Likido is an international technology company developing advanced solutions for the harvesting and recycling of energy.\nOn January 9, 2020, Dalrada acquired 72% of the issued and outstanding shares of Prakat Solutions Inc. a Texas corporation, (Prakat). Prakat provides global customers with software and technology solutions specializing in Test Engineering,\nOn or about March 23, 2020, Dalrada Health acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Shark Innovative Technologies Corp. (Shark). Shark is a cleaning solutions provider using electrostatic machines to spray and deodorize residential spaces, healthcare facilities, hospitality, transportation, manufacturing, automotive, schools/education systems, and other facilities requiring cleaning services.\nOn January 29, 2021, Dalrada Health acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of International Health Group, Inc., a California corporation (IHG). IHG provides highly trained nursing and medical assistants for hospitals and home health facilities since 2006. IHG Medical Assistant programs include CNA (Certified Nursing Assistant) and HHA (Home Health Aide) training and the fast-track 22-Day CNA Certification Program at its state-approved testing facility (see Note 4. Business Combinations and Acquisition for additional information).\nOn February 3, 2021, Dalrada Health acquired 100% of the limited liability units of Pacific Stem Cells, LLC, a California limited liability company (Pacific Stem). Pacific Stem provides regenerative therapy as a potential solution for the prevention, detection, and treatment of cellular breakdown associated with aging and a variety of other conditions (see Note 4. Business Combinations and Acquisition for additional information).\nOn April 21, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the limited liability units of Ignite IT LLC, a Wisconsin limited liability company (Ignite). Ignite is a manufacturer and seller of eco-friendly deep cleaners, parts washers and degreasers that are specially formulated to lift hydrocarbon-based dirt and grease (see Note 4. Business Combinations and Acquisition for additional information).\nIn June 2021, the Company launched Empower Genomics Corp.

Business Combinations and Acquisition for additional information).\nThe Company's principal executive offices are located at 600 La Terraza Blvd., Escondido, California 92025.\nGoing Concern\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had a working capital deficit of $9,357,651 and an accumulated deficit of $121,436,490. The Company incurred negative cash flows from operations for the years ended June 30, 2022, and 2021, and raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the successful financing through equity and/or debt investors and growing the subsidiaries anticipated to be profitable while reducing investments in areas that are not expected to have long-term benefits. The Company expects to fund any short-term operational deficits through collection of outstanding accounts receivable from HRSA, insurance providers, the sale of Likido units as well as loans from related parties.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n(a) Basis of Presentation\nThese consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (US GAAP) and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Companys fiscal year end is June 30.\n(b) Principles of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Dalrada Precision Corp., a company incorporated in the State of California, since June 25, 2018 (date of incorporation), Dalrada Health Products, a company incorporated in the State of California, since October 2, 2018 (date of incorporation), Dalrada Technologies, LLC, a company incorporated in the State of Wyoming, since January 1, 2020 (date of incorporation), Dalrada Energy Services, Inc., a company incorporated in the State of Wyoming, since March 17, 2022 (date of incorporation), since their respective acquisition dates (see Note 4). All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities controlled by the Company through its direct or indirect ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of variable interest entities (VIEs) in which the Company has a variable interest and for which the Company is the primary beneficiary as it has both: (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nIncome attributable to the minority interest in the Company's majority owned and controlled consolidated subsidiaries is recorded as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of operations and the noncontrolling interest is reflected as a separate component of consolidated stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheet.\n(c) Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the revenue, valuation of inventory, valuation of accrued payroll tax liabilities, valuation of acquired assets and liabilities, variables used in the computation of share-based compensation, litigation, and evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment.\nThe Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Companys estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.\n(d) Cash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.\n(e) Concentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, and cash equivalents. The Company generally maintains balances in various operating accounts at financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality, in amounts that may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to its cash and cash equivalents and does not believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships.\nWhen estimating its allowance for credit losses related to revenues from Covid Testing, the Company differentiates its receivables based on the following customer types: healthcare insurers, government payers, and cash payers. Additionally, the Company applies assumptions and judgments for assessing collectability and determining net revenues and accounts receivable from its customers. Historical collection factors we considered for assessing collectability and determining net revenues and accounts receivable from our customers include the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding, history of payment amounts, status of collections due, and applicable statutes of limitations.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2022, healthcare insurers and government payers accounted for over 61% of total revenues. Also, healthcare insurers and government payers amounted to total revenue of $11,824,717. The accounts receivable related to both healthcare insurers and government payers is $4,129,953 as of June 30, 2022.\nAs of the year ended June 30, 2022, $880,500 is owed by a customer from the sale of several Likido units.\n(f) Fair Value Measurements\nPursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.\nLevel 3 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe Companys financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, notes payable, and amounts due to related parties. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of cash is determined based on Level 1 inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.\nThe following tables present information about the Companys financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicates the level of the fair value hierarchy used to determine such fair values:\nSchedule of fair value of assets and liabilities\nFair Value Measurements\nas of June 30, 2022 Using:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiabilities:\nContingent consideration - $ 4,870,800 - $ 4,870,800\n$ - $ 4,870,800 $ - $ 4,870,800\nThe Company records a contingent consideration liability relating to stock price guarantees included in its acquisition and consulting agreements. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration is recorded using a significant observable measure and is therefore classified as a Level 2 financial instrument.\nThe fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to the Companys business combinations is valued based on a forward contract and the guaranteed equity value at settlement as defined in the acquisition agreement (see Note 4. Business Combinations and Acquisition). The fair value of the contingent consideration is then calculated based on the guaranteed equity value at settlement as defined in the acquisition agreement. (See Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies).\nChanges in contingent consideration liability during the year ended June 30, 2022, are as follows:\nSchedule of contingent consideration liability\nContingent\nConsideration\nLiability\nBalance as of June 30, 2021 $ -\nInitial recognition in connection with acquisition of DepTec 5,053,000\nChange in fair value (182,200 )\nBalance as of June 30, 2022 $ 4,870,800\nThe change in fair value was due to the issuance of 333,333 common stock shares pursuant to the acquisition and the change in exchange rates for which the liability needs to be satisfied, British Pounds.\n(g) Convertible Instruments\nThe Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging Activities (ASC 815).\nApplicable U.S. GAAP requires companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria includes circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.\nThe Company accounts for convertible instruments (when the Company has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) as follows. The Company records, when necessary, deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in shares based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the shares.\n(h) Accounts Receivable\nAccounts receivables are derived from products and services delivered to customers and are stated at their net realizable value. Each month, the Company reviews its receivables on a customer-by-customer basis and evaluates whether an allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary based on any known or perceived collection issues. Any balances that are eventually deemed uncollectible are written off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. As of June 30, 2022, and 2021, the Company had an allowance of doubtful accounts of $119,791 and $37,465, respectively.\nPala and Empower have a standardized approach to estimate the amount of consideration that we expect to be entitled to for its COVID-19 testing revenue, including the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials), and patient price concessions. The Company principally estimates the allowance for credit losses by pool based on historical collection experience, the current credit worthiness of the customers, current economic conditions, expectations of future economic conditions and the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding. Adjustments to our estimated contractual allowances and implicit patient price concessions are recorded in the current period as changes in estimates.\nIn March 2022, the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) informed providers that, after March 22, 2022, it would stop accepting claims for testing and treatment for uninsured individuals under the HRSA COVID-19 Uninsured Program and that claims submitted prior to that date would be subject to eligibility and availability of funds. For the year ended June 30, 2022, revenue for testing of uninsured individuals under the HRSA COVID-19 Uninsured Program represented 41% of our COVID-19 testing net revenue. As of June 30, 2022, 26% of our net accounts receivable was associated with claims for reimbursement for COVID-19 testing of uninsured individuals. As a result of HRSA ceasing the COVID-19 Uninsured Program, the Company reduced its Accounts Receivable by $1,661,618 for the year ended June 30, 2022. Although we believe that our estimates for contractual allowances and patient price concessions are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates.\n(i) Inventory\nInventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in first-out basis. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, inventory is comprised of raw materials purchased from suppliers, work-in-progress, and finished goods produced or purchased for resale. The Company establishes inventory reserves for estimated obsolete or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future market conditions.\n(j) Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset, as follows:\nSchedule of property and equipment, estimated useful life\nEstimated Useful Life\nComputer and office equipment\n3 - 5 years\nMachinery and equipment\n5 years\nLeasehold improvements\nShorter of lease term or useful life\nEstimated useful lives are periodically assessed to determine if changes are appropriate. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of these assets and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the balance sheet and any resulting gains or losses are included in the statement of operations loss in the period of disposal.\n(k) Business Combinations and Acquisitions\nThe Company accounts for acquisitions in which it obtains control of one or more businesses as a business combination. The purchase price of the acquired businesses is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recognized as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments, in the period in which they are determined, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. If the assets acquired are not a business, the Company accounts for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, the Company recognizes the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. In addition, for transactions that are business combinations, the Company evaluates the existence of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase.\n(l) Contingent Consideration\nThe Company estimates and records the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration as part of purchase price consideration for acquisitions. Additionally, each reporting period, the Company estimates changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and recognizes any change in fair in the consolidated statement of operations. The estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration requires very subjective assumptions to be made of future operating results, discount rates and probabilities assigned to various potential operating result scenarios. Future revisions to these assumptions could materially change the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration and therefore, materially affect the Companys future financial results. The contingent consideration liability is to be settled with the issuance of shares of common stock once contingent provisions set forth in respective acquisition agreements have been achieved. Upon achievement of contingent provisions, respective liabilities are relieved and offset by increases to common stock and additional paid in capital in the stockholders deficit section of the Companys consolidated balance sheets.\n(m) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets (property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected cash flows, undiscounted, is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.\nGoodwill is tested annually at June 30 for impairment and upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances.\nThe annual goodwill impairment test allows for the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. An entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting units or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to step one of the quantitative impairment tests. If it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of a reporting unit is, more likely than not, less than its carrying value, the quantitative impairment test is required. The quantitative impairment test calculates any goodwill impairment as the difference between the carrying amount of a reporting unit and its fair value, but not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. As of June 30, 2022, there were quantitative factors that indicated goodwill was impaired in the amount of $218,308.\nAn intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. Such an asset is identifiable when it is separable, or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights. Separable assets can be sold, transferred, licensed, etc. Examples of intangible assets include computer software, licenses, trademarks, patents, films, and copyrights. The Companys intangible assets are finite lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\n(n) Revenue Recognition\nThe Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and its related amendments (collectively known as ASC 606), effective January 1, 2019. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\n- Identification of a contract with a customer;\n- Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n- Determination of the transaction price;\n- Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n- Recognition of revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied.\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. As a practical expedient, the Company does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less.\nThe Companys revenue is derived from the sales of its products, which represents net sales recorded in the Companys consolidated statements of operations. Product sales are recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with the customer are satisfied. Typically, this would occur upon transfer of control, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of risk of loss related to those goods. The Company measures revenue as the amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods (transaction price). The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns, allowances, markdowns, and discounts. The Company bases its estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns, markdowns and allowances that have not yet been received by the Company. The actual amount of customer returns and allowances is inherently uncertain and may differ from the Companys estimates. If the Company determines that actual or expected returns or allowances are significantly higher or lower than the reserves it established, it will record a reduction or increase, as appropriate, to net sales in the period in which it makes such a determination. Reserves for returns, and markdowns are included within accrued expenses and other liabilities. Allowance and discounts are recorded in accounts receivable, net and the value of inventory associated with reserves for sales returns are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company estimates warranty claims reserves based on historical results and research and determined that a warranty reserve was not necessary as of June 30, 2022, or 2021.\nNet revenues from COVID-19 testing accounted for over 61% of the Companys total net revenues for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, and primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low-dollar transactions. Pala and Empower, which provides clinical testing services and other services, satisfies its performance obligations and recognizes revenues primarily upon completion of the testing process (when results are reported) or when services have been rendered. Pala and Empower do not invoice the patients themselves for testing but relies on healthcare insurers and government payers for reimbursement for COVID-19 testing. Pala has a standardized approach to estimate the amount of consideration that we expect to be entitled to, including the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials), and patient price concessions. We regularly assess the state of our billing operations in order to identify issues which may impact the collectability of receivables or revenue estimates. We believe that the collectability of our receivables is directly linked to the quality of our billing processes, most notably those related to obtaining the correct information in order to bill effectively for the services we provide. As such, we strive to implement best practices and work with our third-party billing company to reduce the number of requisitions that we receive from healthcare providers with missing or incorrect billing information. We believe that our collection and revenue estimation processes, along with our close monitoring of our billing operations, help to reduce the risk associated with material adjustments to reserve estimates. However, changes to our estimate of the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials) and patient price concessions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition in the period that the estimates are adjusted. Adjustments to our estimated contractual allowances and implicit patient price concessions are recorded in the current period as changes in estimates. Although we have limited track record, further adjustments to the allowances, based on actual receipts, may be recorded upon settlement.\nDES records a sales-type where the Company is the lessor. The Company records its investment in the plant and equipment, used to upgrade a customers real property, leased to franchisees on a net basis, which is comprised of the present value of fixed lease payments not yet received over the course of the energy savings agreements. The current and long-term portions of our net investment in sales-type leases are included in Accounts Receivable, net - related parties and Long-term receivables - related parties respectively. Unearned income is recognized as interest income over the lease term. Sales-type leases result in the recognition of gain or loss at the commencement of the lease, which is recorded to Revenues - related party.\nDepTec recognizes revenues using a cost-based input method, by which we use actual costs incurred relative to the total estimated contract costs to determine, as a percentage, progress toward contract completion. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined.\nThe Company also earns service revenue from its other subsidiaries, including information technology and consulting services via Prakat, educational programs, and courses via IHG, and management services for Solas. For Prakat and Solas, revenues are recognized when performance obligations have been satisfied and the services are complete. This is generally at a point of time upon written completion and client acceptance of the project, which represents transfer of control to the customer. For IHG, revenues are recognized over the course of a semester while services are performed.\nDeferred Revenue:\nASC 606 requires disclosure of the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period and an explanation of when the entity expects to recognize revenue by either a quantitative basis or a qualitative basis.\nDeferred Revenues are made up of deposits and pre-payments related to products not yet delivered, and/or services not yet performed. Deferred revenues for the year ended June 30, 2022, was $720,923 compared to $219,999 as of the year ended June 30, 2021.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table presents the Company's revenue disaggregated by revenue source:\nSchedule of disaggregated revenue\nYear Ended\nJune 30,\nProduct sales - third parties $ 2,280,403 $ 1,053,720\nProduct sales - related party 75,324 62,607\nService revenue - third parties 15,584,154 2,020,307\nService revenue - related party 1,327,732 270,050\nTotal revenue $ 19,267,613 $ 3,406,684\nContract Balances\nThe following table provides information about receivables and contract liabilities from contracts with customers:\nSchedule of receivables and contract liabilities\nJune 30, June 30,\nAccounts receivable, net $ 6,406,555 $ 265,812\nAccounts receivable, net - related parties 41,603 69,952\nLong-term receivables 42,395 -\nLong-term receivables - related parties 1,209,103 -\nDeferred revenue 720,923 219,999\nThe Company invoices customers based upon contractual billing schedules, and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent a set-up fee prepayment received from a customer in advance of performance obligations met.\n(o) Cost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of inventory sold and related freight for product sales and direct labor for information technology and consulting services. The following table is a breakdown of cost of revenue:\nSchedule of cost of revenue\nYear Ended\nJune 30,\nProduct sales $ 2,547,392 $ 1,331,329\nService revenue 6,213,874 1,140,637\nTotal cost of revenue $ 8,761,266 $ 2,471,966\n(p) Advertising\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, and 2021, advertising expenses were $560,777 and $563,907, respectively.\n(q) Stock-based Compensation\nThe Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the quoted market price of the equity instruments issued. During the years ended June 30, 2022, and 2021, stock-based compensation expenses were $2,772,770 and $801,672, respectively.\n(r) Foreign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of the Company is the United States dollar. The functional currency of the Likido and DepTec subsidiaries is the Great British Pound. The functional currency of Prakat is the Indian Rupee. The financial statements of the Companys subsidiaries were translated to United States dollars in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Translation Matters, using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the year for revenues and expenses. Gains and losses arising on foreign currency denominated transactions are included in consolidated statements of operations.\n(s) Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nASC 220, Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the consolidated financial statements. During the years ended June 30, 2022, and 2021, the Companys only component of comprehensive income was foreign currency translation adjustments.\n(t) Non-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests are classified as a separate component of equity in the Company's consolidated balance sheets and statements of changes in stockholders deficit. Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests are reflected separately from consolidated net loss in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss and statements of changes in stockholders deficit. Any change in ownership of a subsidiary while the controlling financial interest is retained is accounted for as an equity transaction between the controlling and non-controlling interests. In addition, when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained non-controlling equity investment in the former subsidiary will be initially measured at fair value and the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the retained interest will be recorded as a gain or loss.\n(u) Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share\nThe Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the periods using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the periods is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants.\nAs all potentially dilutive securities are anti-dilutive as of June 30, 2022, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share. Potentially dilutive items outstanding as of June 30, 2022 are as follows:\nSchedule of anti-dilutive shares\nJune 30, 2022\nConvertible notes payable 2,999,148\nCommon stock warrants 12,025,000\nTotal potentially dilutive items outstanding 15,024,148\nThe average closing price during the year exceeded the exercise prices; as a result, there was no effect during the year ended June 30, 2022.\nIn accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share, the following table reconciles basic shares outstanding to fully diluted shares outstanding for the year ended June 30, 2021:\nReconciliation of common shares outstanding basic to diluted\nYear Ended\nJune 30, 2021\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding - Basic 70,318,073\nPotentially dilutive common stock equivalents (convertible note payable - related party and accrued interest) 58,628,294\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding - Diluted 128,946,367\nThe adjustments to the numerator were insignificant during the year ended June 30, 2021.\n(v) Income Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.\n(w)\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The amendments in this Update simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted this pronouncement on July 1, 2020, and there was not a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity, as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among other changes, the new guidance removes from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated into a debt and equity component, unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the debt is issued at a substantial premium. As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded conversion features in equity and will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of the if-converted method when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent with the Companys current accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company adopted this pronouncement on July 1, 2021, and there was not a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08 - Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2021-08). Under current accounting standards, contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination are to be recorded at fair value using the ASC 805 measurement principle. ASU 2021-08 requires the acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers as if the acquirer had originated the contracts rather than at fair value. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2021-08 on a prospective basis as of January 1, 2022. The election to use practical expedients allowed under ASU 2021-08 will be applied on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. There was no impact to the Companys consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date.\nThe Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.\n3. Investment in Pala Diagnostics\nIn August 2021, Dalrada, through its subsidiary Dalrada Health Products (Dalrada Health), entered a joint venture (JV) with Vivera Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Vivera) for a 51% ownership and controlling interest. The JV, Pala Diagnostics, LLC (Pala) is a CLIA-certified diagnostics lab focused on SARS-CoV-2 testing for now with additional testing capabilities to be introduced. The JV has been treated as a business combination.\nThe Company determined that Pala is a Variable Interest Entity (VIE); we believe that the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Pala, and accordingly, Dalrada is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The Company has consolidated the activities of the VIE.\nPursuant to the partnership agreement, Dalrada contributed equity in the amount of $500,000 for operating capital and Vivera contributed property and equipment at a fair value of $111,185. This amount was recorded to non-controlling interest equity balance in the consolidated balance sheets.\nPursuant to the JV agreement, Dalrada issued 250,000 shares of common stock to Vivera in October 2021. The fair value of $58,560 was recorded to goodwill as of June 30, 2022.\nIn December 2021, Dalrada Health filed suit against Vivera and Paul Edalat, Viveras Chairman and CEO, for misappropriation of funds on behalf of the joint venture in the amount of $2,104,509. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for additional information related to the lawsuit with Vivera.\n4. Business Combinations and Acquisition\nFiscal 2022 Transactions\nDeposition Technology Ltd. (DepTec)\nEffective April 7, 2022, the Company acquired 100% of the common stock of DepTec at a valuation of 2,000,000 Great Britain Pounds (GBP). In consideration for the acquisition, the Company shall issue 3,000,000 shares of its common stock evenly every quarter for 24 months with the initial distribution to take place on the effective date (the Share Consideration).\nIf at the end of the 24-month stock distribution period, beginning on the effective date of April 7, 2022 (the Distribution Period), the value of common stock consideration does not equate to 4,000,000 GBP (the Target Amount) in value (based on the GBP to USD currency exchange rate of 1.30690 on April 7, 2022, is $5,228,000 USD), then the Company shall issue additional shares equal to the shortfall between the value of the Share Consideration and the Target Amount (the Valuation Shortfall). The value of the issued stock shall be deemed at the date of issue, which is the end of the Distribution Period.\nAs a result of the Valuation Shortfall, the Company recorded contingent consideration (see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in connection to the acquisition. The following is a summary of the purchase price consideration:\nSchedule of purchase price consideration\nCommon stock to be issued $ 175,000\nContingent consideration 5,053,000\nTotal purchase price consideration $ 5,228,000\nThe Company acquired DepTec to expand it Precision Manufacturing segment into the microchip and semiconductor industries. Furthermore, DepTecs location, experience and manufacturing capabilities can leverage synergies with Likido. A founder and principal of DepTec is a related party to the CEO of the Company.\nThe DepTec transaction was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805). The Company has determined preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These values are subject to change as we perform additional reviews of our assumptions utilized.\nThe Company has made a preliminary allocation of the purchase price regarding the acquisition related to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the purchase date. The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation:\nPurchase price allocation\nPurchase Price\nAllocation\nCash and cash equivalents $ 301,647\nAccounts receivable, net 375,357\nInventories 146,300\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 6,025\nProperty and equipment, net 28,437\nIntangible assets 1,899,259\nGoodwill 2,874,259\nAccounts payable (240,056 )\nAccrued liabilities (108,180 )\nDeferred revenue -\nNotes payable (55,048 )\nPurchase price consideration $ 5,228,000\nIntangible assets acquired include trademarks, developed technology and customer relationships, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over ten to fifteen years. The fair value estimates of the intangibles for the purchase price allocation were based on an analysis of the present value of future cash flows, relief from royalty, and a replacement cost approach.\nGoodwill is primarily attributable to the go-to-market synergies that are expected to arise as a result of the acquisition and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\nWatson Rx LLC (Watson)\nEffective June 7, 2022, the Company acquired 100% of the common stock of Watson. In consideration for the acquisition, the Company shall issue 2,000,000 shares of its common stock per the following schedule: 1,000,000 shares to be issued at the effective date of the Agreement; and 1,000,000 shares issued in even amounts every quarter over a period of two years beginning on the effective date of June 7, 2022.\nThe following is a summary of the purchase price consideration:\nSchedule of purchase price consideration\nCommon stock (and to be issued) $ 918,000\nLine of credit 244,395\nBank loan 467,712\nTotal purchase price consideration $ 1,630,107\nThe common stock value of $918,000 was based on the value of 2,000,000 common stock shares at the Companys price per share on the effective date of acquisition, or June 7, 2022.\nThe Company acquired Watson to further integrate Dalrada Health Products into the education, nursing, and other health solutions through a comprehensive pharmaceutical opportunity with licenses in 50 States including Washington D.C. Dalrada Health Products expects to strategically integrate the services of the diagnostic laboratories with the pharmaceutical business.\nThe Watson transaction was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805). The Company has determined preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These values are subject to change as we perform additional reviews of our assumptions utilized.\nThe Company has made a preliminary allocation of the purchase price regarding the acquisition related to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests as of the purchase date.

The fair value estimates of the intangibles for the purchase price allocation were based on an analysis of the present value of future cash flows, relief from royalty, and a replacement cost approach.\nGoodwill is primarily attributable to the go-to-market synergies that are expected to arise as a result of the acquisition and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\nFiscal 2021 Transactions\nInternational Health Group, Inc. (IHG)\nEffective January 29, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the common stock of IHG. In consideration for the acquisition, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of its common stock at $0.44 per share, or a total fair value of $440,000. The Company acquired IHG to expand into the educational sector of the Health and Human Services Industry.\nThe International Health Group transaction was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805). The Company has determined the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nThe Company has made an allocation of the purchase price in regard to the acquisition related to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests as of the purchase date.

The principal and interest, which will accrue at a rate of 5% per annum, payable under the Debentures will mature 15 months from the issuance date (the Maturity Date), unless earlier converted or redeemed by the Company. At any time before the Maturity Date, the Buyer may convert the Debentures into the Companys common stock at the Fixed Conversion Price. Beginning on May 1, 2022 and continuing on the first day of each calendar month thereafter through February 1, 2023, the Principal amount plus a 20% redemption premium and plus accrued and unpaid interest will be subject to monthly redemption (Monthly Redemption). Under Monthly Redemption, the Company shall redeem an applicable redemption amount in accordance with the redemption schedule provided in the Debenture, which is subject to pro rata adjustment to reflect the conversion or redemption otherwise effected pursuant to the Debenture contemporaneous with or prior to the scheduled redemption date, in cash, in common stock through the Buyers conversion of the Debenture (at any time after the applicable redemption date), or a combination of both at the Companys option. With respect to each Monthly Redemption all or partially in common stock, the conversion price shall be the lower of (1) the Fixed Conversion Price, or (2) 100% of the lowest daily VWAP during the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of conversion (the Variable Conversion Price).

The Company shall pay a redemption premium equal to 20% (the Redemption Premium) of the principal amount being redeemed.\nIn connection with the Debenture, the Company issued to the Buyer warrants equal to 30% coverage exercisable at a strike price equal to the Fixed Conversion Price determined at the date of the initial closing, or a total of 983,499 warrants to purchase common stock.

The warrants issued with the debt will be accounted for as a debt discount and will be amortized as interest expense over the life of the note. The warrants were valued using the Monte Carlo model and the Company recognized $1,427,495 as a debt discount related to the warrants.

On February 25, 2021, the Company amended the plan to issue up to 4,500,000 shares and issued an aggregate of 4,500,000 common shares, or 500,000 shares to each board member (9). 3,500,000 shares of common stock were granted on July 9, 2020, at $0.08 per share and 1,000,000 shares of common stock were granted on February 25, 2021, at $0.45 per share, for a total fair value of $730,000, which is included in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOn May 10, 2021, the Company granted 1,000,000 options to purchase common stock to its Chief Financial Officer with an exercise price of $0.47 per share.

All cashless warrants carry a $0.45 exercise price and a ten-year term. The Company recorded stock-based compensation related to the 6,500,000 shares in prior periods. The issuance of the warrants was treated as a modification and, as a result of the value of the stock-based compensation of the shares cancelled being greater than the stock-based compensation related to the cashless warrants issued, no additional stock-based compensation expense was recorded for the year ended June 30, 2022.\nOn November 30, 2021, the Company issued 2,275,000 cashless warrants to employees and consultants for services performed. 825,000 cashless warrants vested immediately and 1,450,000 cashless warrants vests over a 36-month period.

Commitments and Contingencies\nLease Commitments\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. This determination generally depends on whether the arrangement conveys to the Company the right to control the use of an explicitly or implicitly identified fixed asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control of an underlying asset is conveyed to the Company if the Company obtains the rights to direct the use of and to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from using the underlying asset. The Company has lease agreements which include lease and non-lease components, which the Company has elected to account for as a single lease component for all classes of underlying assets. Lease expense for variable lease components is recognized when the obligation is probable.\nOperating lease right of use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease payments are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company primarily leases buildings (real estate) which are classified as operating leases. ASC 842 requires a lessee to discount its unpaid lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. As an implicit interest rate is not readily determinable in the Company's leases, the incremental borrowing rate is used based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nThe lease term for all the Company's leases includes the non-cancellable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by either a Company option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, or an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease controlled by the lessor. Options for lease renewals have been excluded from the lease term (and lease liability) for the majority of the Company's leases as the reasonably certain threshold is not met.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are comprised of fixed payments, variable payments that depend on index or rate, and amounts probable to be payable under the exercise of the Company option to purchase the underlying asset if reasonably certain.\nVariable lease payments not dependent on a rate or index associated with the Company's leases are recognized when the event, activity, or circumstance in the lease agreement on which those payments are assessed as probable. Variable lease payments are presented as operating expenses in the Company's income statement in the same line item as expense arising from fixed lease payments. As of and during the year ended June 30, 2021, management determined that there were no variable lease costs.\nRight of Use Asset\nIn May 2020, the Company entered into a five-year lease agreement to lease a commercial building in Escondido, California.

Imputed interest is $116,482. The lease agreements mature in April 2025. Total amounts expensed under the lease during the years ended June 30,2022, and 2021, were $396,081 and $343,205, respectively, for which $49,104 is included accounts payable and accrued liabilities - related parties.\nIn May 2020, the Company entered into three-year lease agreement to lease a warehouse in Brownsville, Texas.

Income Taxes\nWe file income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and in various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities. The Company is currently on extension and has yet to file their income tax return for the year ended June 30, 2022.\nAs of June 30, 2022, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of $26,089,624 that may be offset against future taxable income which will begin to expire in 2038 through 2041.\nThe reconciliation of income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the income tax provision for the years ended June 30, 2022, and 2021 is as follows:\nReconciliation of Income Taxes\nCurrent:\nFederal $ - $ -\nState - -\nForeign 132,513 -\nTotal current income tax expense 132,513 -\nDeferred:\nFederal (2,239,061 ) (1,607,556 )\nState (622,074 ) (446,626 )\nTotal deferred income tax expense (2,861,136 ) (2,054,182 )\nValuation allowance 2,861,135 2,054,182\nTotal provision for income taxes $ 132,513 $ -\nThe provision for income tax for the year ended June 30, 2022, is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of: (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes; and (b) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. Significant components of deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2022, and 2021 were as follows:\nSchedule of deferred taxes\nDepreciation & Amortization $ 30,382 $ 1,521\nReserves and Accruals 122,154 250,907\nResearch & Development Credits - -\nNet Operating Loss Carryforwards 5,649,387 2,688,360\nGross Deferred Tax Assets 5,801,923 2,940,788\nValuation Allowance (5,801,923 ) (2,940,788 )\nNet Deferred Tax Assets $ - $ -\nReconciliation of the statutory federal income tax to the Company's effective tax:\nSchedule of reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax\nTax at Federal Statutory Rate\n21.0 %\n21.0 %\nState, Net of Federal Benefit\n4.4 %\n(36,423)%\nForeign Tax\n0.9 %\n(0.00)%\nTax Exempt Interest Income\n(0.2)%\n(155,721)%\nGain on Expiration of Accrued Tax Liability\n0.00 %\n10,224%\nStock Based Compensation\n(4.1)%\n10,224 %\nNondeductible Interest\n0.8 %\n(0.00)%\nChange in Valuation Allowance\n(20.3)%\n168,522 %\nProvision for Taxes\n(0.9)%\n196.6 %\nThe difference in the effective rate and the statutory rate is due to permanent differences, primarily deductibility of penalties and interest on accrued payroll tax liabilities and the gains related to the expiration of the statute of limitations for accrued payroll tax liabilities.\n16.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and our CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by the Annual Report were not effective and that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and our CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\nOur management, with the participation of our CEO and our CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework. Based on this evaluation, our management, with the participation of the CEO and CFO, concluded that, as of June 30, 2022, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2021, the CFO determined that Management's assessment of the effectiveness of the registrant's internal control over financial reporting is as of the year ended June 30, 2022. The Company believes that internal control over financial reporting is not effective. We and our independent registered public accounting firm have identified the following current material weakness, which some were first identified on June 30, 2021, and others identified as June 30, 2022, considering the nature and extent of our current operations and any risks or errors in financial reporting under current operations:\n\u00b7 Lack of Management oversight and review of the financial reporting process, including presentation of the financial statements and related disclosures;\n\u00b7 Lack of procedures related to recognition of revenues;\n\u00b7 Lack of procedures related to the calculation and allocation of the purchase price, including acquired intangibles, in connection with business acquisitions.\n\u00b7 Identification and recording of right of use assets and liabilities\n\u00b7 Lack of effective travel and entertainment policy\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding our internal controls over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only managements report in this Annual Report.\nNo Attestation Report by Independent Registered Accountant\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, has not been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm by virtue of our exemption from such requirement as a smaller reporting company.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting except as noted above.

The Company currently does not meet either of these requirements.\nThe NASDAQ rules have both objective tests and a subjective test for determining who is an independent director. The objective tests state, for example, that a director is not considered independent if he or she is an employee of the Company or is a partner, executive officer or controlling stockholder of an entity to which the Company made, or from which the Company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed the greater of $200,000 or 5% of the recipients consolidated gross revenue for that year or a family member serves in the current fiscal year or has served at any time during the last three fiscal years as an executive officer of the Company.
