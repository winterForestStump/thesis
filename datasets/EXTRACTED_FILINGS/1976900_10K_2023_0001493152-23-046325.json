As of September 30, 2023, 213,855,500 shares of our Common Stock were issued.\nOn September 8, 2023, we received a notice of effectiveness from SEC. Since the effectiveness, we have not received a ticker symbol and our shares of Common Stock have not been quoted on any exchange.\nISSUANCE OF SHARES AND HOLDERS\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company did not issue any shares of Common Stock.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had 213,855,500 shares of our Common Stock, par value $0.0001 issued and outstanding. There were 150 beneficial owners of our Common Stock.\nOur Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and sole director, Mr. Hsu Shou Hung (Mr. Hsu), collectively with his exclusively owned company, Terra Wave Holdings Limited (TERRA), holds 96,260,000 shares or 45.01% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, comprised of his individual ownership of Common Stock of 86,260,000 shares, as well as 10,000,000 shares held by TERRA.\nBetween November 1, 2023, and December 13, 2023, the Company sold 1,357,400 shares of restricted Common Stock to thirty-one (31) individuals in a private placement at a price of $0.50 per share, for total proceeds of $678,700.\nAfter the issuance of 1,357,400 shares of Common Stock from November 1, 2023, to December 13, 2023, Mr. Hsus beneficial shareholding ownership changed from 45.01% to 44.73% accordingly.\nAs of the date of this filing, we have 215,212,900 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and no shares of Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding.\nTRANSFER AGENT AND REGISTRAR\nAs of the date of this filing, we do not have a transfer agent.\nPENNY STOCK REGULATIONS\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share. Our Common Stock, when and if a trading market develops, may fall within the definition of penny stock and be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets more than $1,000,000, or annual incomes exceeding $200,000 individually, or $300,000, together with their spouse).\nFor transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and have received the purchasers prior written consent to the transaction. Additionally, for any transaction, other than exempt transactions, involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealers presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Consequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common Stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their Common Stock in the secondary market.\nIn addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our Common Stock, which may limit the investors ability to buy and sell our stock.\nDIVIDEND POLICY\nAny future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends on shares of our Common Stock will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors out of funds legally available for such purpose. We are under no contractual obligations or restrictions to declare or pay dividends on our shares of Common Stock. In addition, we currently have no plans to pay such dividends. Our Board of Directors currently intends to retain all earnings for use in the business for the foreseeable future.\nSECURITIES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS\nWe have not established any compensation plans under which equity securities are authorized for issuance.\nRECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES\nBetween November 1, 2023, and December 13, 2023, the Company sold 1,357,400 shares of restricted Common Stock to thirty-one (31) individuals in a private placement at a price of $0.50 per share, for total proceeds of $678,700.\nSet forth below is a listing of the November and December 2023 sale of shares of restricted Common Stock:\nName Number of Shares\nLin Yueh Feng 60,000\nHsu Tsui Lien 60,000\nChou Yu Ju 40,000\nChen Pei Ru 60,000\nLu Po Wei 40,000\nLim Yee Ching 6,000\nLiu Chia Ling 60,000\nLee Shih Pin 60,000\nChen Yu Ching 40,000\nChang Che Chih 40,000\nLai Tung Ning 60,000\nChen Jie Yu 60,000\nLee Huai Ku 40,000\nChang Po Hsuan 20,000\nYang Ke Yu 80,000\nLin Yi Ying 60,000\nChen Yung Sheng 40,000\nLiu Jui Hsin 40,000\nChan Chih Chieh 80,000\nDigital Content Culture Sdn.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nDFP Holdings Limited (the Company or we) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 8, 2021, and has a fiscal year end of September 30.\nGOING CONCERN\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $714,332 and used cash in operations of $215,101. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that its financial statements are issued. In addition, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on the Companys September 30, 2023, audited financial statements, raised substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The Companys financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nManagement estimates that the current funds on hand will be sufficient to continue operations through the next six months. The Companys ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to continue to implement its business plan to increase its customer base and realize increased revenues. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the case of equity financing.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nUSE OF ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include estimates for assumptions used in impairment testing of long-term assets and the accrual of potential liabilities.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Boards (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, following the five-step model prescribed by ASC 606, which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers to its clients.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2023:\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, we generated revenue of $1,216,130.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, operating expenses were $1,910,632, including cost of revenue of $188,658, general and administrative expenses of $909,960, general and administrative expenses to related party of $362,014 and impairment of prepaid application development fee to related party of $450,000, respectively.\n2022:\nFor the period from December 8, 2021 (Inception) to September 30, 2022, we generated revenue of $111,201.\nFor the period from December 8, 2021 (Inception) to September 30, 2022, operating expenses were $844,242, including cost of revenue of $41,540, general and administrative expenses of $37,366, general and administrative expenses to related party of $315,336 and impairment of prepaid application development fee to related party of $450,000, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $714,332 and used cash in operations of $215,101. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that its financial statements are issued. In addition, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on the Companys September 30, 2023, audited financial statements, raised substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The Companys financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Companys ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to continue to implement its business plan to increase its customer base and realize increased revenues. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the case of equity financing.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of September 30, 2023, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe financial statements required by this item are in PART IV of this Annual Report. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive and financial officer, we are responsible for conducting an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures means that the material information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms relating to our company, including any consolidating subsidiaries, and was made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period when this report was being prepared. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive and financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2023 due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described below.\nMANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Management conducted an assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on the framework and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) (COSO). Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, the Companys internal controls over financial reporting was not effective.\nWe identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe material weaknesses identified include (i) the Company did not maintain a functioning independent audit committee and did not maintain an independent board; (ii) the Company had inadequate segregation of duties; and (iii) the Company had an insufficient number of personnel with an appropriate level of U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience and ongoing training in the application of U.S. GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements commensurate with the Companys financial reporting requirements.\nNotwithstanding the identified material weaknesses, management has concluded that the Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods disclosed in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\nPlanned remediation of material weaknesses\nManagement is actively engaged in developing and implementing remediation plans to address the material weaknesses described above. These remediation efforts are ongoing and include or are expected to include preparation of written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures, and to increase personnel and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function.\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThere was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Report, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the Companys registered independent public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by the Companys registered independent public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only managements report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nNone.\nPART III ITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nBiographical information regarding the sole officer and director of the Company is provided below:\nNAME\nAGE\nPOSITION\nHsu Shou Hung\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chairman of Board of Directors\nThe sole officer and director named above will serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders or until his respective resignation or removal from office. Thereafter, directors are anticipated to be elected for one-year terms at the annual stockholders meeting. Officers will hold their positions at the pleasure of the Board of Directors, absent any employment agreement, of which none currently exists or is contemplated.\nSet forth below is a brief description of the background and business experience of our sole officer and director.\nMr. Hsu has been our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Director since the Companys incorporation. Mr. Hsu has over 20 years of management experience. From 1999 to 2009, he was the general manager of Lead International Financial Advisory Co., Ltd., a company focusing on international financial products sales. From 2003 to 2005, he was a Distinguished Lecturer at Fuxin Enterprise Management Consulting CO., Ltd. From 2005 to 2007, he was a Distinguished Lecturer at Guangzhou Benchmark Enterprise Management Co., Ltd. From 2008 to 2009 he was a Distinguished Lecturer at Beijing Wenhe Fanglue Information Co., Ltd. From 2012 to 2016, Mr. Hsu was the General Management at Oriental Ivy International Co., Ltd., a company that offers retail and wholesale cosmetics. From 2012 to 2017, Mr. Hsu was a General Manager at Suzhou Shuiyue Ivy Trading Co., Ltd., a cosmetic retailer. From 2017 to present, Mr. Hsu has served as a general manager of Shanghai Haoguan Enterprise Management Consulting Co., Ltd., a corporation that provides business management consulting, corporate education, and training. Mr. Hsu holds a bachelors degree in Statistics at Tamkang University, Taiwan.\nMr. Hsu brings to the Board of Directors his business leadership and extensive experience in consultancy, education services and training.\nTERM OF OFFICE\nAll directors hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified. The Companys Bylaws provide that the Board of Directors will consist of no less than three members. Officers are elected by and serve at the discretion of the Board of Directors.\nDIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE\nOur Board of Directors is currently composed of one member who does not qualify as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market (though the Company may have a plan to list on the NASDAQ Global Market later). The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least three years, one of our employees and that neither the director, nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition, our Board of Directors has not made a subjective determination as to our director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of our Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our Board of Directors made these determinations, our Board of Directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by our director and us regarding to our directors business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management.\nCERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nNo director, nominee for director, or executive officer of the Company has appeared as a party in any legal proceeding material to an evaluation of his ability or integrity during the past five years.\nSIGNIFICANT EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS\nOther than our sole officer and director, we currently have no other significant employees.\nAUDIT COMMITTEE AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\nSince we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our directors. The Board of Directors has not established an audit committee and does not have an audit committee financial expert, nor has the Board of Directors established a nominating committee. The Board is of the opinion that such committees are not necessary since the Company is an early exploration stage company and has only two directors, and to date, such directors have been performing the functions of such committees. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation, nominations, and audit issues that may affect management decisions.\nThere are no family relationships among our directors or officers. Other than as described above, we are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executive officers or directors.\nSECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE\nSection 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities, file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers, directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with all Section 16(a) forms they file. Specific due dates for these reports have been established and the Company is required to report in this report any failure to file by these dates.\nAll filing requirements were satisfied by the Companys officers, directors, and ten-percent holders.\nIn making these statements, we have relied on the written representation of our officers and directors or copies of the reports that they have filed with the Commission.\nCODE OF ETHICS\nWe have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board of Directors evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and determined that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal, business conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or Directors expand in the future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics.\nSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS\nOur Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors. The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations for election or appointment.\nA shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President, at the address appearing on the first page of this Information Statement.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2023, and for the period from December 8, 2021 (Inception) to September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, during the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss and had negative cash flows from operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in relation to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2022.\n/s/Weinberg & Company, P.A.\nLos Angeles, California\nDecember 28, 2023\nDFP HOLDINGS LIMITED\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2023, AND 2022\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars)\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 763,591 $ 1,461,506\nAccounts receivable -

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDescription of business\nDFP Holdings Limited, a Nevada corporation (the Company), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 8, 2021. The Company provides online and offline educational services in Taiwan. The Company has a September 30 fiscal year end.\nOn March 8, 2022, the Companys wholly owned subsidiary, DFP Holdings Limited, was formed in Seychelles (the Seychelles Company). The Seychelles Company is an intermediate holding company, and operates business through its wholly owned subsidiary, DFP Holdings Limited, a company incorporated in Taiwan (the Taiwan Company).\nOn May 24, 2022, the Company acquired 100% of Tide Holdings Limited, a company incorporated in Seychelles (TIDE) from Mr. Hsu Shou Hung, the CEO of the Company, for $1.\nGoing concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $714,332 and used cash in operations of $215,101. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that these financial statements are issued. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nManagement estimates that the current funds on hand will be sufficient to continue operations through the next six months. The Companys ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to continue to implement its business plan to increase its customer base and realize increased revenues. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the case of equity financing.\nRisks & uncertainties resulting from inflation, COVID-19, and geopolitical instability\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to slow its spread, the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and other geopolitical and macroeconomic factors beyond our control, the global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability.\nIf equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may affect our ability to raise equity capital, borrow on our existing facilities, access our existing cash, or make any additional necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain, more costly and/or more dilutive.\nBasis of presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP).\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Tide Holdings Limited (TIDE), DFP Holdings Limited (Seychelles) (the Seychelles Company), and DFP Holdings Limited (Taiwan) (the Taiwan Company). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include estimates for assumptions used in impairment testing of long-term assets, and the accrual of potential liabilities.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Boards (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, following the five-step model prescribed by ASC 606, which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers to its clients.\nThe Companys revenue consists of revenue from providing online and offline educational services (service revenue). Revenue is recognized in the period in which the services are delivered, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. The Company offers no discounts, rebates, rights of return, or other allowances to clients which would result in the establishment of reserves against service revenue. Additionally, to date, the Company has not incurred incremental costs in obtaining a client contract. The Company recognizes revenue from subscription services ratably over the subscription period. The Company recognizes deferred revenue at each period end for contracts that have been paid but which the related service has not been performed or delivered.\nCost of revenue\nCost of service revenue primarily consists of advertising and promotion fee, and facility rentals directly attributable to the services rendered.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash equivalents includes demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with original maturities at purchase of three months or less, including money market funds.\nSCHEDULE OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nAs of\nSeptember 30,\nCash and cash equivalents\nDenominated in United States Dollars $ 480,406 $ 1,378,501\nDenominated in New Taiwan Dollars 283,185 83,005\nCash and cash equivalents $ 763,591 $ 1,461,506\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash. As of September 30, 2023, substantially all the Companys cash was held by two major financial institutions located in Taiwan, which management believes is of high credit quality. At September 30, 2023, none of the Companys cash accounts are insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC).\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable is recorded at the invoiced amounts net of an allowance for expected losses. The Company evaluates the collectability of our accounts receivable based on several factors. In circumstances where it becomes aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount that management believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on our historical losses and an overall assessment of past due accounts receivable outstanding. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no reserve recorded for uncollectible accounts receivable.\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Additions, improvements, and major renewals or replacements that substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets of four years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term.\nManagement assesses the carrying value of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment, management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value at that time. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, management determined there were no impairments of the Companys property and equipment.\nSoftware costs\nCosts related to developing or obtaining internal-use software incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages of an internal use software project will be expensed as incurred and certain costs incurred in the projects application development stage will be capitalized. On an annual basis, or more frequently as conditions indicate, the Company will assess the recovery of the unamortized software development costs by estimating the net undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the unamortized software cost, such assets will be considered to be impaired. The impairment to be recognized will be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. During the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized an impairment of prepaid application development fees of $450,000, and during the period from December 8, 2021 to September 30, 2022, the Company recognized another impairment of prepaid application development fees of $450,000.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment by comparison of the carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset over the assets fair value generally determined by estimates of future discounted cash flows.\nLeases\nThe Company currently lease an office space under a short-term lease from an external party. A short-term lease is defined as a lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. For all short-term leases, the Company does not recognize a lease liability or right-of-use asset on the balance sheet. Instead, the Company recognizes short-term lease payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For the year ended September 30, 2023, total rent expense was $24,492. During the period December 8, 2021 (Inception) to September 30, 0222, the Company had no rent expense.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach which allows for the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their benefits, or that future deductibility is uncertain.\nThe Company conducts its business in Taiwan and is subject to tax in Taiwan jurisdictions. As a result of its business activities, the Company will file tax returns that are subject to examination by the Taiwan tax authority. The Companys deferred tax assets relate to the Companys net operating losses in the U.S. and net operating losses and temporary differences between accounting basis and tax basis for its Taiwan-based subsidiaries which are subject to corporate income tax in Taiwan.\nFair value measurements\nThe Company follows the guidance of ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\nLevel 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe Company believes the carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, deferred revenue and due to officer, approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.\nForeign currency translation\nThe reporting currency of the Company is the United States Dollars (US$) and the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been expressed in US$. In addition, the Companys operating subsidiary maintains its books and records in its functional currency, New Taiwan Dollars (NT$).\nIn general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of the Companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the US$, are translated into US$ using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of a foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within stockholders equity.\nTranslation of amounts from the local currencies of the Company into US$ has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective periods:\nSCHEDULE OF TRANSLATION OF AMOUNTS BETWEEN USD AND TWD\nAs of and for the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 As of\nSeptember 30, 2022 and from\nDecember 8, 2021 (Inception) to\nSeptember 30, 2022\nPeriod-end NT$ : US$1 exchange rate 32.28 31.79\nPeriod-average NT$ : US$1 exchange rate 31.11 29.23\nNet income (loss) per share\nThe Company calculates net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is computed similar to basic income (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.\nAt September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company has no potentially dilutive securities, such as options or warrants, outstanding.\nSegment information\nOperating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and are evaluated regularly by the Companys chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. The Companys chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer. The Companys Chief Executive Officer views the Companys operations and manages its business in one operating segment, which is conducting business as an educational service company.\nConcentrations\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from December 8, 2021 (Inception) to September 30, 2022, no customer accounted for 10% or of the Companys revenue.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from December 8, 2021(Inception) to September 30, 2022, one service provider, a related party, accounted for 42% and 91% of the Companys operating costs and expenses, respectively.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). This ASU reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock and amends the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entitys own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. In addition, this ASU improves and amends the related earnings per share guidance. This standard becomes effective for the Company beginning on October 1, 2024. Adoption is either a modified retrospective method or a fully retrospective method of transition. The Company adopted this guidance effective October 1, 2023, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nOther recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Companys present or future financial statements.\nNOTE 2 - STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company did not issue any shares of Common Stock.\nFor the period from December 8, 2021 (Inception) to September 30, 2022, the Company issued 213,855,500 shares of restricted Common Stock to 150 shareholders at prices ranging from $0.0001 to $0.25 per share, for total proceeds of $2,170,100.\nShares issued to founders\nOn February 25, 2022, the Company issued 86,260,000 shares of founders restricted Common Stock to Mr. Hsu Shou Hung, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, sole director and a founder of the Company, and issued and 10,000,000 shares of restricted stock to Mr. Hsus wholly owned company, Terra Wave Holdings Limited at $0.0001 per share, for total proceeds of $9,626.\nBetween February 22, 2022, and February 25, 2022, the Company issued 103,740,000 shares of restricted Common Stock to an additional 31 founders at $0.0001 per share, for total additional proceeds of $10,374.\nShares issued for cash in private placements\nBetween March 1, 2022, and September 26, 2022, the Company sold 13,855,500 shares of restricted Common Stock to another 117 shareholders at prices ranging from $0.10 to $0.25 per share, for total proceeds of $2,150,100.\nThe Company sold 7,200,000 shares of restricted Common Stock to 45 shareholders at $0.10 per share for $720,000, 4,675,500 shares of restricted Common Stock to 42 shareholders at $0.20 per share for $935,100, and 1,980,000 shares of restricted Common Stock to 30 shareholders at $0.25 per share for $495,000.\nNOTE 3 - INCOME TAXES\nThe Company recorded and paid income tax expense of $27,990 for the year ended September 30, 2023, while no provision for income taxes was made for the period from December 8, 2021 (Inception) to September 30, 2022.\nProvision for income taxes consisted of the following:\nSCHEDULE OF PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\nYear ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 For the\nperiod from\nDecember 8, 2021\n(Inception) to\nSeptember 30, 2022\nCurrent:\nU.S. $ - $ -\nTaiwan 27,990 -\nSubtotal 27,990\nCurrent: 27,990\nDeferred: - -\nProvision for Income tax $ 27,990 $ -\nA reconciliation of the income tax expense determined at the statutory income tax rate to the Companys income taxes is as follows:\nSCHEDULE OF COMPONENTS OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE BENEFIT\nYear ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 For the period from\nDecember 8, 2021 (Inception) to\nSeptember 30, 2022\nLoss before income taxes $ (686,342 ) $ (732,677 )\nUnited States of America statutory income tax rate 21 % 21 %\nIncome tax (benefit) expense computed at statutory corporate income tax rate (144,132 ) (153,862 )\nEffect of different tax jurisdictions 6,864 7,327\nChange in valuation allowance 165,258 146,535\nProvision for income taxes $ 27,990 $ -\nThe Companys wholly owned subsidiary in Taiwan, DFP Holdings Limited (Taiwan) (the Taiwan Company), is governed by the income tax law of Taiwan and is subject to a tax rate of 20%.\nSignificant components of the aggregate deferred tax assets consisted of the following:\nSCHEDULE OF OMPONENTS OF AGGREGATE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS\nAs of\nSeptember 30,\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss carry forwards $ 297,994 $ 153,862\nGross deferred tax assets 297,994 153,862\nLess: valuation allowance (297,994 ) (153,862 )\nNet deferred tax assets $ - $ -\nThe provisions of ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, based on all available objective evidence, including the existence of cumulative losses, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets were not fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. The Company intends to maintain a full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance.\nThe Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740, which requires companies to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any tax benefit can be recorded in the financial statements. ASC 740 also provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, classification and interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be recorded or disclosed.\nNOTE 4 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nOn December 8, 2021, Mr. Hsu Shou Hung (Mr. Hsu), a founder of the Company, was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, and sole director of the Company.
