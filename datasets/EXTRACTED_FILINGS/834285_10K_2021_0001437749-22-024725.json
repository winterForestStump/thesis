Except as required by applicable law or regulation, we do not undertake, and specifically disclaim any obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect any changed assumptions, any unanticipated events or any changes in the future. Significant factors which could have an adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the Company are detailed in the Risk Factors section included under Item 1A: Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information included elsewhere in this report and in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition, the following factors could significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or future prospects. Any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or future prospects. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual results may be materially adversely affected. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know or that we currently believe are immaterial which could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or future prospects.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including when the coronavirus can be controlled and abated. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, we could be subject to any of the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\nDemand for our products and services may decline;\nIf the economy worsens, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase;\nCollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value;\nOur allowance for credit losses may have to be increased if economic conditions worsen or if borrowers experience financial difficulties;\nThe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;\nOur cyber security risks are increased as a result of an increase in the number of employees working remotely; and\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums may increase if the agency experiences additional resolution costs.\nMoreover, our future success and profitability substantially depends on the management skills of our executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to the outbreak could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy. We may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability.\nAny one or a combination of the factors identified above, or other factors, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to our Lending Activities\nWe are subject to credit risk in connection with our lending activities, and our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted by economic conditions and other factors that adversely affect our borrowers.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are affected by the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, and in a timely manner. Lending money is a significant part of our banking business. Borrowers, however, do not always repay their loans. The risk of non-payment is assessed through our underwriting and loan review procedures based on several factors including credit risks of a particular borrower, changes in economic conditions, the duration of the loan, and in the case of a collateralized loan, uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral and other factors. Despite our efforts, we do and will experience loan losses, and our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. Our non-performing assets were approximately $12.5 million at December 31, 2021. Our allowance for loan losses was approximately $19.0 million at December 31, 2021. Our loans between 30-89 days delinquent totaled $9.6 million at December 31, 2021.\nOur concentration of commercial real estate loans could result in increased loan losses and costs of compliance.\nAt December 31, 2021, commercial real estate loans totaled $780.3 million, or 31.0% of our loan portfolio. Given their larger balances and the complexity of the underlying collateral, commercial real estate loans generally have more risk than the single-family residential loans that we originate. Because the repayment of commercial real estate loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrowers properties or related businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local real estate market or economy. If we foreclose on these loans, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for a single-family residential property because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. In addition, commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to single-family residential loans. Accordingly, charge-offs on commercial real estate loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred by our single-family residential real estate or consumer loan portfolios.\nThe commercial real estate market is cyclical and poses risks of loss to us because of the concentration of commercial real estate loans in our loan portfolio, and the lack of diversity in risk associated with such a concentration. Banking regulators have been giving and continue to give commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny, and banks with larger commercial real estate loan portfolios are expected by their regulators to implement improved underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress-testing practices to manage risks associated with commercial real estate lending. In addition, commercial real estate lenders are making greater provisions for credit losses and accumulating higher capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending exposures. Additional losses or regulatory requirements related to our commercial real estate loan concentration could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to absorb actual loan losses, and we may be required to make further provisions for credit losses and charge off additional loans in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses, established through a provision for credit losses accounted for as an expense, which is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio. If our allowance for credit losses is inadequate, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe determination of the allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require us to increase our allowance for credit losses. Increases in nonperforming loans have a significant impact on our allowance for credit losses. Our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to absorb actual loan losses. If trends in the real estate markets were to deteriorate, we could experience increased delinquencies and credit losses, particularly with respect to real estate construction and land acquisition and development loans and one-to four-family residential mortgage loans. As a result, we may have to make provisions for credit losses and charge off loans in the future, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to our internal processes for determining loss allowances, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase the provision for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments that differ from those of our management. Any increases in our allowance for credit losses will result in a decrease in net income and capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur mortgage banking revenue and the value of our mortgage servicing rights can be volatile.\nIn 2021, we originated $579.8 million residential mortgage loans and sold $398.7 million of those loans to investors in the secondary market. The residential mortgage business is highly competitive, and highly susceptible to changes in market interest rates, consumer confidence levels, employment statistics, the capacity and willingness of secondary market purchasers to acquire and hold or securitize loans, and other factors beyond our control.\nBecause we sell a substantial number of the mortgage loans we originate, the profitability of our mortgage banking business also depends in large part on our ability to originate a high volume of loans and sell them in the secondary market at a gain. In fact, as rates rise, we expect (1) the demand for mortgage loans to fall thereby reducing loan origination volume and (2) increasing industry-wide competitive pressures reducing our pricing margins, both of which would reduce our mortgage revenues. Thus, in addition to our dependence on the interest rate environment, we are dependent upon (1) the existence of an active secondary market and (2) our ability to profitably sell loans or securities into that market. If our level of mortgage production declines, the profitability will depend upon our ability to reduce our costs commensurate with the reduction of revenue from our mortgage operations.\nOur ability to originate and sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon the availability of an active secondary market for single-family mortgage loans, which in turn depends in part upon the continuation of programs currently offered by government-sponsored entities (GSEs) and other institutional and non-institutional investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. We are highly dependent on these purchasers continuing their mortgage purchasing programs. Additionally, because the largest participants in the secondary market are Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, GSEs whose activities are governed by federal law, any future changes in laws that significantly affect the activity of these GSEs could, in turn, adversely affect our operations. In September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into conservatorship by the U.S. government. The federal government has for many years considered proposals to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but the results of any such reform, and their impact on us, are difficult to predict. To date, no reform proposal has been enacted.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify buyers against losses in some circumstances, which could harm liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe sell a large portion of the mortgage loans that we originate. When mortgage loans are sold, whether as whole loans or pursuant to a securitization, we are required to make customary representations and warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers, including the GSEs, about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. Whole loan sale agreements require that we repurchase or substitute mortgage loans or indemnify buyers against losses in the event we breach these representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan, resulting in these mortgage loans being placed on our books and subjecting us to the risk of a potential default. A subsequent sale of a repurchased mortgage loan could be at a significant discount to the unpaid principal balance. The Company maintains a reserve for repurchased loans. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims and are in excess of our provision for potential losses, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe may be exposed to environmental liabilities with respect to real estate that we have or had title to in the past.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. In the course of our business, we may foreclose, accept deeds in lieu of foreclosure, or otherwise acquire real estate in connection with our lending activities. We also acquire real estate in connection with our store expansion plans and growth strategy. As a result, we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may become responsible to a governmental agency or third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean-up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with environmental investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before acquiring title to any real property, these may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. If we were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities, it could materially and adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to Accounting and Disclosure Matters\nWe are required to make significant estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements, including our allowance for loan losses, and our estimates and assumptions may not be accurate.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, require our management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods. These estimates and assumptions are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. The critical estimates are made by management in determining, among other things, the allowance for loan losses and the realization of deferred income taxes. If our underlying estimates and assumptions prove to be incorrect, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur assets as of December 31, 2021 included a deferred tax asset and we may not be able to realize the full amount of such asset.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2021, the net deferred tax asset was $14.2 million, compared to a balance of $12.0 million at December 31, 2020.\nWe regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e. likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within its life cycle, based on the weight of available evidence. If management makes a determination based on the available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods, a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and judgments concerning managements evaluation of both positive and negative evidence.\nBased on the analysis of the available positive and negative evidence, we determined that a valuation allowance should not be recorded as of December 31, 2021. We used projections of future taxable income, exclusive of reversing temporary timing differences and carryforwards, as a factor to project recoverability of the deferred tax asset balance. There can be no assurance as to when or whether we will be in a position to fully recapture the benefits of our deferred tax asset. Further discussion on the analysis of our deferred tax asset can be found in the Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes section of Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOur failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures related to the structure and operations of our corporate governance may result in current and potential shareholders losing confidence in our financial reporting and disclosures and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, referred to as Section 404, we are required to include in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our managements report on internal control over financial reporting.\nAs part of our ongoing monitoring of internal and disclosure controls for the year ended December 31, 2021, we discovered material weaknesses in our internal and disclosure controls that required remediation. See Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Effective internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and disclosures to shareholders, to prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports and disclosures or prevent fraud, our business may be adversely affected, our reputation and operating results could be harmed could and our current and potential shareholders and customers could lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosure required under the Exchange Act, which could adversely affect our business.\nControl processes that involve human diligence and compliance, such as our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, are subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Controls can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there are risks that material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected and that information may not be reported on a timely basis. If our controls are not effective, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and market for our common stock, and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nManagement concluded there were deficiencies in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that represented material weaknesses in the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, including from a failure to maintain an effective control environment, which resulted in deficiencies in the communication of certain relevant information to the Board of Directors of the Company, including information related to branch expenditures. While the material weaknesses did not result in a misstatement of the Companys financial statements, effective internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and disclosures to shareholders, to prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports and disclosures or prevent fraud, our business may be adversely affected, our reputation and operating results could be harmed and our current and potential shareholders and customers could lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosure required under the Exchange Act, which could adversely affect our business. For more information, see Item 9A: Disclosure Controls and Procedures.\nContinued delays in the filing of our periodic reports with the SEC could impact our listing on Nasdaq, which would materially and adversely affect our stock price, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nAs a result of an independent review concerning related party transactions, the Companys internal controls, and the associated financial statement and disclosure implications, and the evaluation of such independent review by the Companys Audit Committee and management and by the Companys independent registered public accounting firm in connection with the audit of the Companys financial statements as of an for the year ended December 31, 2021, we were unable to file this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC on a timely basis. We have not filed our Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, which were due in May 2022 and August 2022, respectively. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. If we are not able to file our delinquent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our common stock may be subject to delisting by Nasdaq.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by other-than-temporary impairment charges relating to our investment portfolio.\nIn prior years we recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges for certain bank pooled trust preferred securities, and we may be required to record future impairment charges on our investment securities if they suffer declines in value that we determine are other-than-temporary. Numerous factors, including the lack of liquidity for re-sales of certain investment securities, the absence of reliable pricing information for investment securities, adverse changes in the business climate, adverse regulatory actions or unanticipated changes in the competitive environment, could have a negative effect on our investment portfolio in future periods. If an impairment charge is significant enough, it could affect the Banks ability to pay dividends, which could materially adversely affect us. Significant impairment charges could also negatively impact our regulatory capital ratios and result in us not being classified as well-capitalized for regulatory purposes.\nA significant percentage of our assets is invested in securities, which typically have a lower yield than our loan portfolio.\nOur results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income. At December 31, 2021, 50.7% of our assets were invested in investment securities and cash and cash equivalents. These investments yield substantially less than the loans we hold in our portfolio. While we intend to invest a greater proportion of our assets in loans with the goal of increasing our net interest income, we may not be able to increase originations of loans that are acceptable to us. Further, at December 31, 2021, $1.7 billion, or 60.7%, of our securities portfolio was designated as held to maturity. As a result, we are unable to sell these securities to respond to changes in interest rates that may occur in the future.\nUnfavorable economic and financial market conditions may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nEconomic pressure on consumers and businesses, the impact of inflation, any resulting lack of confidence in the financial markets, the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and the responses thereto, risks related to the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, including, but not limited to, the impact from, and compliance with, economic sanctions, and concerns surrounding the long term fiscal position of the United States may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. A worsening of current economic conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of market conditions on us and others in the industry. In particular, we may face the following risks in connection with these events:\n\u25cf\nincreased regulation of our industry and increased compliance costs;\n\u25cf\nhampering our ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and to estimate the losses inherent in our credit exposure, as such assessments are made more complex by these difficult market and economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nincreasing our credit risk, by increasing the likelihood that our customers are unable to satisfy their obligations to us;\n\u25cf\nimpairing our ability to originate loans, by making our customers and prospective customers less willing to borrow, and making loans that meet our underwriting criteria difficult to find; and\n\u25cf\nlimiting our interest income, by depressing the yields we are able to earn on our investment portfolio.\nOur business is concentrated in and dependent upon the continued growth and welfare of our primary market area.\nOur primary service area consists of Greater Philadelphia, Southern New Jersey, and New York City. Our success depends upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in this area. Although our customers businesses and financial interests may extend well beyond this area, adverse economic conditions that affect our primary service area could reduce our growth rate, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us, and generally adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Because of our geographic concentration, we are less able than other regional or national financial institutions to diversify our credit risks across multiple markets.\nA transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") as a reference rate for financial instruments could negatively affect our income and expenses and the value of various financial instruments.\nLIBOR is used extensively in the United States and globally as a benchmark for various commercial and financial contracts, including adjustable rate mortgages, corporate debt, interest rate swaps and other derivatives. LIBOR is set based on interest rate information reported by certain banks, which may stop reporting such information after 2021. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. On November 30, 2020, to facilitate an orderly LIBOR transition, the OCC, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve Board jointly announced that entering into new contracts using LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021 would create a safety and soundness risk. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of 1-week and 2-month LIBOR, and immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining LIBOR settings. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates are ongoing, and the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (\"ARRC\") has recommended the use of a Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\"SOFR\"). SOFR is different from LIBOR in that it is a backward-looking secured rate rather than a forward-looking unsecured rate.\nThere are operational issues, which may create a delay in the transition to SOFR or other substitute indices, leading to uncertainty across the industry. These consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives over loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit.\nRisks Related to Market Interest Rates\nOur net interest income, net income and results of operations are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates.\nOur net income depends on the net income of Republic, and Republic is dependent primarily upon its net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on its interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the interest paid on its interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nOur results of operations will be affected by changes in market interest rates and other economic factors beyond our control. If our interest-earning assets have longer effective maturities than our interest-bearing liabilities, the yield on our interest-earning assets generally will adjust more slowly than the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, and, as a result, our net interest income generally will be adversely affected by material and prolonged increases in interest rates, and positively affected by comparable declines in interest rates. Conversely, if liabilities re-price more slowly than assets, net interest income would be adversely affected by declining interest rates, and positively affected by increasing interest rates. At any time, our assets and liabilities will reflect interest rate risk of some degree.\nIn addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. A decline in interest rates generally results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities as borrowers refinance their debt to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities. Furthermore, an inverted interest rate yield curve, where short-term interest rates (which are usually the rates at which financial institutions borrow funds) are higher than long-term interest rates (which are usually the rates at which financial institutions lend funds for fixed-rate loans) can reduce a financial institutions net interest margin and create financial risk for financial institutions that originate longer-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans.\nIn addition to affecting interest income and expense, changes in interest rates also can affect the value of our interest-earning assets, comprising fixed and adjustable-rate instruments, as well as the ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets. Generally, the value of fixed-rate instruments fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates, and changes in interest rates may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Business Strategy\nPotential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value.\nWe regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire and invest in banks and in other complementary businesses. As a result, we may engage in negotiations or discussions that, if they were to result in a transaction, could involve a number of additional risks, including the risks of:\n\u25cf\nincurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions;\n\u25cf\nusing inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management, and market risks with respect to the target institution or its assets;\n\u25cf\ndiluting our tangible book value and earnings per share in the short- and long-term by payment of a premium over book and market values;\n\u25cf\nincurring potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company;\n\u25cf\nexposing ourselves to potential asset quality problems of the target company;\n\u25cf\ndiluting current shareholders ownership interest by issuing additional shares of common stock;\n\u25cf\nrecording goodwill, which if impaired would be required to recognize a charge against our earnings;\n\u25cf\nfailing to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits of the acquisition;\n\u25cf\npotential disrupting our business;\n\u25cf\nthe time and expense required to integrate the operations and personnel of the combined businesses;\n\u25cf\ncreating an adverse short-term effect on our results of operations; and\n\u25cf\nlosing key employees and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly conceived.\nWe may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with potential acquisitions. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business strategy and maintain our market value.\nWe may not be able to manage our growth, which may adversely impact our financial results.\nAs part of our retail growth strategy, we may expand into additional communities or attempt to strengthen our position in our current markets by opening new stores and acquiring existing branches of other financial institutions. To the extent that we undertake additional stores openings and acquisitions, we are likely to experience the effects of higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations, which may have an adverse effect on our levels of reported net income, return on average equity and return on average assets. Other effects of engaging in such growth strategies may include potential diversion of our managements time and attention and general disruption to our business.\nAs part of our retail strategy, we plan to open new stores in our primary service area, including Southern New Jersey, the Greater Philadelphia area, and New York City. We may not, however, be able to identify attractive locations on terms favorable to us, obtain regulatory approvals, or hire qualified management to operate new stores. In addition, the organizational and overhead costs may be greater than we anticipate. New stores may take longer than expected to reach profitability, or may not become profitable. The additional costs of starting new stores may adversely impact our financial results.\nOur ability to manage growth successfully will depend on whether we can continue to fund our growth while maintaining cost controls, as well as on factors beyond our control, such as national and regional economic conditions and interest rate trends. If we are not able to control costs, such growth could adversely impact our earnings and financial condition.\nOur retail strategy relies heavily on our management team, and the unexpected loss of key managers may adversely affect our operations.\nIn recent years, we have been successful in attracting new and talented employees to our management team. We believe that our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy will require us to retain and attract additional management experienced in banking and financial services, and familiar with the communities in our market. Our ability to retain executive officers, the current management team, branch managers and loan officers of Republic will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategy. It is also critical, as we grow, to be able to attract and retain additional members of the management team and qualified loan officers with the appropriate level of experience and knowledge about our market areas to implement the community-based operating strategy. The unexpected loss of services of any key management personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we want to, or are compelled to, raise additional capital in the future, that capital may not be available to us when it is needed or on terms that are favorable to us or current shareholders.\nFederal banking regulators require us, and Republic, to maintain capital to support our operations. Regulatory capital ratios are defined and required ratios are established by laws and regulations promulgated by banking regulatory agencies. At December 31, 2021, our regulatory capital ratios were above well capitalized levels under current bank regulatory guidelines. To be well capitalized, banking companies generally must maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%, a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%. Regulators, however, may require us, or Republic, to maintain higher regulatory capital ratios.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources to meet our commitments and business needs. We may also at some point need to raise additional capital to support our continued growth. Our ability to raise additional capital in the future will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, on our financial performance and on other factors. Accordingly, we may not be able to raise additional capital on terms and time frames acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital in sufficient amounts when needed, our ability to comply with regulatory capital requirements could be materially impaired. Additionally, the inability to raise capital in sufficient amounts may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to raise capital could also be impaired by factors that are nonspecific to us, such as disruption of the financial markets or negative news and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. If we raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other securities, we would dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders, and could dilute the per share book value and earnings per share of our common stock. Furthermore, a capital raise through issuance of additional shares may have an adverse impact on our stock price.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nWe are subject to numerous governmental regulations and to comprehensive examination and supervision by regulators, which could have an adverse impact on our operations and could restrict the scope of our operations.\nBoth the Company and Republic operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to supervision and regulation by several governmental regulatory agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (PDB). We are subject to federal and state regulations governing virtually all aspects of our activities, including lines of business, capital, liquidity, investments, payment of dividends, and others. Regulations that apply to us are generally intended to provide protection for depositors and customers rather than investors.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations. See Item 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation. The requirements and limitations imposed by such laws and regulations limit the manner in which we conduct our business, undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing. Financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation in recent years and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future, none of which is within our control. Compliance with these rules could impose additional costs on banking entities and their holding companies. Management has reviewed the new standards and will continue to evaluate all options and strategies to ensure ongoing compliance with the new standards, notwithstanding Republics current status as well-capitalized.\nNew programs and proposals may subject us and other financial institutions to additional restrictions, oversight and costs that may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our common stock. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied or enforced. We cannot predict the substance or impact of future legislation, regulation or the application thereof. Compliance with such current and potential regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner.\nAny change in regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent accounting firm. These changes could materially impact, potentially even retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Competition\nWe face significant competition in our market from other banks and financial institutions.\nThe banking and financial services industry in our market area is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and higher lending limits than we have and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. We may not be able to compete effectively in our markets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The increasingly competitive environment is a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, and consolidation among financial service providers. Larger institutions have greater access to capital markets, with higher lending limits and a broader array of services. Competition may require increases in deposit rates and decreases in loan rates, and adversely impact our net interest margin. Competition also makes it increasingly difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area.\nThe financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of new legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks, such as financial technology companies, securities companies and specialty finance companies to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can.\nRisks Related to Operational Matters\nWe may not have the resources to effectively implement new technologies, which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations.\nThe financial services industry is constantly undergoing technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow and expand in our market. Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior products to those that we will be able to offer, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our customers. If we are unable to do so, our competitive position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\nEmployee or customer errors and misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee or customer errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors, and customer or employee fraud. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSystem failure or breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Computer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to us and may cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us. Although we, with the help of third-party service providers, intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage, these security measures may not be successful. In addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. A failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThere may be future sales of our common stock, which may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common or preferred stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock. Our issuance of shares of common stock, preferred stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock in the future will dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders.\nAdditionally, the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock, whether directly by us or by existing common shareholders in the secondary market, the perception that such sales could occur or the availability for future sale of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock could, in turn, materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Governance Matters\nOur governing documents, Pennsylvania law, and current policies of our Board of Directors contain provisions, which may reduce the likelihood of a change in control transaction, which may otherwise be available and attractive to shareholders.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive or may discourage a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by our Board of Directors. In particular, the articles of incorporation and bylaws: classify our Board of Directors into three groups, so that shareholders elect only approximately one-third of the Board each year; permit shareholders to remove directors only for cause and only upon the vote of the holders of at least 75% of the voting shares; require our shareholders to give us advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the Board of Directors or to make shareholder proposals at a shareholders meeting; require the vote of the holders of at least 75% of our voting shares for shareholder amendments to our bylaws; require the vote of the holders of at least 75% of our voting shares to approve certain business combinations; and restrict the holdings and voting rights of shareholders who would acquire more than 10% of our outstanding common stock without the approval of two-thirds of our Board of Directors. These provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, even though a majority of our shareholders may consider such proposals desirable. Such provisions could also make it more difficult for third parties to remove and replace the members of our Board of Directors. Moreover, these provisions could diminish the opportunities for shareholders to participate in certain tender offers, including tender offers at prices above the then-current market value of our common stock, and may also prevent increases in the trading price of our common stock that could result from takeover attempts or speculation.\nIn addition, anti-takeover provisions in Pennsylvania and federal law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. These provisions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could reduce the amount that shareholders might receive if we are sold. For example, Pennsylvania and federal law may restrict a third partys ability to obtain control of us and may prevent shareholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock.\nOur business could be impacted by a potential proxy contest for the election of directors at our 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\nIn December 2021, Driver Management Company LLC (together with its affiliates, the \"Activist Investor\"), announced the nomination of three candidates for election to our Board of Directors at our 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. A proxy contest with the Activist Investor for the election of directors could result in us incurring substantial costs, including proxy solicitation, public relations, and legal fees. Further, such a proxy contest could divert the attention of our Board of Directors, management, and employees, and may disrupt the momentum in our business and operations, as well as our ability to execute our strategic plan. The actions of the Activist Investor may also create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy, which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, and may impact our relationship with investors, vendors, and other third parties. A proxy contest could also impact the market price and the volatility of our common stock. Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone. Item 2: Description of Properties\nWe currently have thirty-nine locations that we utilize to conduct business. Seven of these locations are utilized for loan production offices, storage facilities, operations and back office support, and our corporate headquarters. Thirty-two properties are store locations that are open and operating as of December 31, 2021. We have another four locations under our control for future store locations. Of the forty-three total locations, seventeen are owned by Republic. The remaining twenty-six locations are subject to land and building leases. The spaces covered by these leases range in size from 1,700 to 10,590 square feet with the exception of our corporate headquarters which consists of approximately 53,000 square feet. Please see Note 25 Leases in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the leases. Management believes these properties and facilities are adequate to meet our present and immediately foreseeable needs from a real estate perspective. Item 3: Legal Proceedings\nThe Company and Republic are from time to time parties (plaintiff or defendant) to lawsuits in the normal course of business. While any litigation involves an element of uncertainty, management is of the opinion that the liability of the Company and Republic, if any, resulting from such actions will not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company and Republic.\nOn March 8, 2022, George E. Norcross, III, Gregory B. Braca, and Philip Norcross filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Commerce Program) against the Company and Company directors Vernon W. Hill II, Theodore J. Flocco, Jr., Brian Tierney, and Barry Spevak. The complaint seeks, among other things, declaratory and injunctive relief enjoining the Company and the individual defendants from implementing any amendments to the Companys executive employment agreements until after the Companys 2022 annual meeting of shareholders or taking any other actions outside the ordinary course of business, including executing or extending any related party agreements or any agreements obligating the incurrence of expenses related to the opening of new branches and the renovation of existing branches, without the affirmative vote of a majority of independent directors.\nOn March 29, 2022, George E. Norcross, III filed suit in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas to compel the Company to make available for inspection the books and records as is required under Pennsylvania law.\nAs of the date of this filing, Mr. Norcross has filed papers with the Court dismissing the actions without prejudice.\nOn September 19, 2022, a complaint was filed in the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania against the Company and its current Interim Chief Executive Officer and director and two other current directors. The plaintiffs, the former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and a former director of the Company, allege defamation, defamation per se and false light against the three individual defendants and a breach of the plaintiffs employment agreement by the Company. The complaint seeks certain reimbursement payments and compensatory and punitive damages. The matter is in its early stages and, accordingly, the Company is still assessing the potential outcomes and materiality of the matter. The Company plans to defend itself vigorously in this matter. Item 4: Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5: Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information\nShares of the Companys class of common stock are listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol FRBK. As of October 18, 2022, there were approximately 100 registered shareholders of Republic First Bancorp, Inc. common stock. Most shares are held in nominee or street name and accordingly, the number of beneficial owners of those shares is not known or included in the previous number.\nDividend Policy\nThe Company has not paid any cash dividends on its common stock and has no plans to pay cash dividends on its common stock during 2022. The Company paid $3.5 million during 2021 and $923,000 in non-cumulative preferred stock dividends during 2020. The Companys ability to pay dividends depends primarily on receipt of dividends from the Companys subsidiary, Republic. Dividend payments from Republic are subject to legal and regulatory limitations. The ability of Republic to pay dividends is also subject to profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements.

We grew assets, loans, and deposits resulting in dramatic improvement in profitability during the year. Earnings improved by nearly 400% year over year as a result of our ongoing effort to drive revenue growth at a greater rate than expense growth.\nFinancial Highlights\n\u25cf\nNet income increased by 398% to $25.2 million, or $0.33 per share for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $5.1 million, or $0.07 per share for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u25cf\nEarnings before tax increased to $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. This represents an increase of $27.3 million, or 426%, year over year.\n\u25cf\nThe improvement in earnings was driven by strong growth in revenue while our focus on cost control initiatives continues to limit expense growth. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021, total revenue increased 26% and non-interest expense increased by 4% compared to the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020.\n\u25cf\nTotal deposits increased by $1.2 billion, or 29%, to $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared to $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. New stores opened since the beginning of the Power of Red is Back expansion campaign are currently growing deposits at an average rate of $41 million per year, while the average deposit growth for all stores over the last twelve months was approximately $37 million per store.\n\u25cf\nWe achieved this significant growth in deposits while driving down the overall cost of funds. The cost of funds decreased to 0.40% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to 0.64% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\n\u25cf\nTotal assets increased by $561 million, or 11%, to $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 compared to $5.1 billion as of December 31, 2020. Excluding PPP loans, which were $636.6 million and $119.0 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, total assets increased by $1.1 billion, or 24%, year over year.\n\u25cf\nExcluding PPP loans, total loans grew $371 million, or 18%, to $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2020.\n\u25cf\nAsset quality remains strong as the ratio of non-performing assets to total assets declined to 0.24% as of December 31, 2021 compared to 0.28% as of December 31, 2020. There were no customers deferring loan payments at the end of the year. All customers that were granted deferrals during the height of the COVID pandemic have resumed contractual payments.\n\u25cf\nThe net interest margin increased by 18 basis points to 2.69% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2.51% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by a decline in the cost of funds during 2021.\n\u25cf\nWe had 32 convenient store locations open at year end. We opened a new store in Ocean City in January 2022 and Wayne in April 2022. Construction is ongoing at an additional site in Broomall, Pennsylvania, which is expected to opening in late 2022.\n\u25cf\nOur residential mortgage division, Oak Mortgage, is serving the home financing needs of customers throughout our footprint. The Oak Mortgage team originated more than $579 million in mortgage loans during 2021.\n\u25cf\nBook value per common share increased to $4.68 as of December 31, 2021 compared to $4.41 as of December 31, 2020.\nPPP Loan Program\nThe Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) included in the CARES Act authorized financial institutions to make loans to companies impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We responded by quickly developing a process to accept applications for the program not only from our valued small business customers, but from non-customers throughout our community as well.\n\u25cf\nDuring 2020, we originated more than $680 million in the first round of the PPP loan program for more than 5,000 businesses. Republic was one of the top PPP lenders in the country as of March 31, 2020, as the percentage of PPP loans originated compared to our existing loan portfolio balances reached 36%.\n\u25cf\nWe originated more than 2,500 PPP loans totaling $272 million during the second round of the PPP loan program.\n\u25cf\nMore than 50% of the PPP loan applications received were from businesses that were not existing customers of Republic Bank, many of which have switched their primary banking relationship with Republic.\n\u25cf\nNet origination fees received by Republic for both rounds of the PPP loan program totaled $32 million. As of December 31, 2021 $4 million in fees remain deferred and will be recognized as income in future periods.\n\u25cf\nWe continue to assist our PPP loan customers with the application process for loan forgiveness with fewer than 800 loan forgiveness applications remaining to be processed.\nNon-GAAP Based Financial Measures\nOur selected financial data contains a non-GAAP financial measure calculated using non-GAAP amounts. This measure is tangible book value per common share. Tangible book value per share adjusts the numerator by the amount of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (as a reduction of Shareholders Equity). Management uses non-GAAP measures to present historical periods comparable to the current period presentation. Management believes the use of non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity when assessing our financial results and use of equity. Disclosures of this type should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other entities.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of tangible book value per common share as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n(dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, 2021\nDecember 31, 2020\nTotal shareholders equity\n$ 324,242\n$ 308,113\nReconciling items:\nPreferred stock\n(48,325 )\n(48,325 )\nGoodwill\n-\n-\nTangible common equity\n$ 275,917\n$ 259,788\nCommon shares outstanding\n58,943,153\n58,859,778\nBook value per common share\n$ 4.68\n$ 4.41\nTangible book value per common share\n$ 4.68\n$ 4.41\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates\nIn reviewing and understanding our financial information, you are encouraged to read the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. These policies are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting and financial reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis including those related to the allowance for loan losses and deferred income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These form the basis for making judgments on the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe have identified the policies related to the allowance for loan losses and deferred income taxes as being critical.\nAllowance for Loan Losses - The allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents managements estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments would represent managements estimate of losses inherent in its unfunded loan commitments and would be recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, if necessary. The allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to operations. Loans are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectability of the loan principal is unlikely. Recoveries on loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance.\nThe allowance for credit losses is an amount that represents managements estimate of known and inherent losses related to the loan portfolio and unfunded loan commitments. Because the allowance for credit losses is dependent, to a great extent, on the general economy and other conditions that may be beyond Republics control, the estimate of the allowance for credit losses could differ materially in the near term.\nThe allowance consists of specific, general and unallocated components. The specific component relates to loans that are categorized as impaired. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers non-classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for several qualitative factors. An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect managements estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio. All identified losses are immediately charged off and therefore no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any individual loan or group of loans, and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan losses.\nIn estimating the allowance for credit losses, management considers current economic conditions, past loss experience, composition of the loan portfolio, delinquency statistics, results of internal loan reviews and regulatory examinations, borrowers perceived financial and managerial strengths, the adequacy of underlying collateral, if collateral dependent, or present value of future cash flows, and other relevant and qualitative risk factors. These qualitative risk factors include:\n1)\nLending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices.\n2)\nNational, regional and local economic and business conditions as well as the condition of various segments.\n3)\nSize and composition of the portfolio and terms of loans.\n4)\nExperience, ability and depth of lending management and staff.\n5)\nVolume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans as well as other loan modifications.\n6)\nQuality of the Companys loan review system, and the degree of oversight by the Companys Board of Directors.\n7)\nExistence and effect of any concentration of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations.\n8)\nEffect of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements.\nEach factor is assigned a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on managements best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. Adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions in a narrative accompanying the allowance for loan loss calculation.\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, and the borrowers prior payment record. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial and construction loans by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, the loans obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.\nAn allowance for loan losses is established for an impaired loan if its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The estimated fair values of substantially all of the Companys impaired loans are measured based on the estimated fair value of the loans collateral.\nFor commercial, consumer, and residential loans secured by real estate, estimated fair values are determined primarily through third-party appraisals. When a real estate secured loan becomes impaired, a decision is made regarding whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary. This decision is based on various considerations, including the age of the most recent appraisal, the loan-to-value ratio based on the original appraisal and the condition of the property. Appraised values are discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral, which is considered to be the estimated fair value. The discounts also include estimated costs to sell the property.\nFor commercial and industrial loans secured by non-real estate collateral, such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, estimated fair values are determined based on the borrowers financial statements, inventory reports, accounts receivable agings or equipment appraisals or invoices. Indications of value from these sources are generally discounted based on the age of the financial information or the quality of the assets.\nAs a result of the changes in economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we increased the qualitative factors for certain components of the allowance for loan loss calculation. We have also taken into consideration the probable impact that the various stimulus initiatives provided through the CARES Act, along with other government programs, may have to assist borrowers during this period of economic stress. We believe the combination of ongoing communication with our customers, relatively low loan-to-value ratios on underlying collateral, loan payment deferrals, increased focus on risk management practices, and access to government programs such as the PPP should help mitigate potential future period losses. We will continue to closely monitor all key economic indicators and our internal asset quality metrics as the effects of the coronavirus pandemic continues to unfold.\nLoans whose terms are modified are classified as troubled debt restructurings if the Company grants such borrowers concessions and it is deemed that those borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty. Concessions granted under a troubled debt restructuring generally involve a temporary reduction in interest rate or an extension of a loans stated maturity date. Non-accrual troubled debt restructurings are restored to accrual status if principal and interest payments, under the modified terms, are current for six consecutive months after modification. Loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are designated as impaired.\nPursuant to the CARES Act, loan modifications made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of (i) December 30, 2020 or (ii) 60 days after the President declared a termination of the COVID-19 national emergency are not classified as TDRs if the related loans were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. In December 2020, the Economic Aid Act was signed into law which amended certain sections of the CARES Act. This amendment extended the period to suspend the requirements under TDR accounting guidance to the earlier of (i) January 1, 2022 or (ii) 60 days after the President declared a termination of the national emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2021, there were no loan customers deferring loan payments, and all customers that were granted deferrals to assist during the COVID pandemic have resumed contractual payments. At December 31, 2020, twenty-one customers with outstanding balance of $16 million, were deferring loan payments. At December 31, 2020, deferrals were comprised of the following categories: 90 day deferrals amounted to eight customers with outstanding balances of $3 million and second deferrals amounted to thirteen customers with outstanding balances of $13 million.\nThe general component of the allowance calculation includes further segregation of loan classes into risk rating categories. The borrowers overall financial condition, repayment sources, guarantors and value of collateral, if appropriate, are evaluated annually for commercial loans or when credit deficiencies arise, such as delinquent loan payments, for commercial and consumer loans. Credit quality risk ratings include regulatory classifications of special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss. Loans classified special mention have potential weaknesses that deserve managements close attention. If uncorrected, the potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects. Loans classified substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They include loans that are inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified substandard with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current conditions and facts, is highly improbable. Loans classified as a loss are considered uncollectible and are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Loans not classified as special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss are rated pass.\nIn addition, federal and state regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Companys allowance for loan losses and may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Management believes the level of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2021 was adequate.\nThe Company adopted CECL effective January 1, 2022. Our implementation process included, among other things, assessment and documentation of governance and reporting processes and related internal controls; model development, documentation and validation; and the incorporation of qualitative adjustments for model limitations. ASU 2016-13 lists several credit loss methods that are acceptable such as a discounted cash flow method, loss-rate method and probability of default/loss given default (PD/LGD). We contracted with a third-party vendor to assist us in the application of ASU 2016-13 and utilize various methodologies such as Vintage, Cohort, and Weighted Average Remaining Maturity to estimate the allowance for credit losses. CECL and the resulting impact are discussed in more detail throughout the document.\nIncome Taxes - Management makes estimates and judgments to calculate various tax liabilities and determine the recoverability of various deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses. Management also estimates a reserve for deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. These estimates and judgments are inherently subjective. Historically, managements estimates and judgments to calculate the deferred tax accounts have not required significant revision.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets, management considers available positive and negative evidence, including the past operating results and forecasts of future taxable income. In determining future taxable income, management makes assumptions for the amount of taxable income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require management to make judgments about the future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the business. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require management to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on future earnings.\nResults of Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020\nWe reported net income of $25.2 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to net income of $5.1 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Earnings in 2021 were positively impacted by the Companys focus on driving revenue growth and limiting expense growth through cost control initiatives.\nNet interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 increased $37.4 million to $129.2 million as compared to $91.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Growth in net interest income was a result of an increase in interest income of $32.9 million and a reduction in interest expense of $4.5 million. The increase in interest income of $32.9 million, or 29%, was driven by an increase in average interest-earning assets, primarily investment securities and loans receivable. Interest expense decreased $4.5 million, or 20%, primarily due to a decrease in the rate on average interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest margin increased by 18 basis points to 2.69% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2.51% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nWe recorded a loan loss provision of $5.8 million, an increase of $1.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to a provision of $4.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase was largely associated with assumptions and estimates related to the uncertainty surrounding the economic environment, the nature of and concentration in certain credit types within the loan portfolio and loan growth for the period.\nNon-interest income decreased $3.5 million to $32.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $36.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in mortgage banking income and gains on the sale of investment securities partially offset by an increase in service fees on deposit accounts and gains on the sale of SBA loans during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.\nNon-interest expenses increased $5.1 million to $122.5 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $117.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher salaries, employee benefits, occupancy, and equipment expenses associated with our expansion strategy, offset by a goodwill impairment charge of $5.0 million in 2020.\nReturn on average assets and average equity were 0.50% and 7.92%, respectively, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to 0.13% and 1.86%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nAverage Balances and Net Interest Income\nHistorically, our earnings have depended primarily upon Republics net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by changes in the mix of the volume and rates of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The following table provides an analysis of net interest income on an annualized basis, setting forth for the periods average assets, liabilities, and shareholders equity, interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, average yields earned on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities, and Republics net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets). Averages are computed based on daily balances. Non-accrual loans are included in average loans receivable. Yields are adjusted for tax equivalency, a non-GAAP measure, using a rate of 21% in 2021, 21% in 2020, and 21% in 2019.\nAverage Balances and Net Interest Income\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2021\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2020\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2019\n(dollars in thousands)\nAverage Balance\nInterest Income/\nExpense\nYield/\nRate(1)\nAverage Balance\nInterest Income/\nExpense\nYield/\nRate(1)\nAverage Balance\nInterest Income/\nExpense\nYield/\nRate(1)\nInterest-earning assets:\nFederal funds sold and other interest earning assets\n$ 352,417\n$\n0.13 %\n$ 242,132\n$\n0.21 %\n$ 129,528\n$ 2,571\n1.98 %\nInvestment securities and restricted stock\n1,890,629\n32,542\n1.72 %\n1,086,386\n21,166\n1.95 %\n1,074,706\n27,886\n2.59 %\nLoans receivable\n2,577,498\n115,340\n4.47 %\n2,359,169\n93,854\n3.98 %\n1,544,904\n74,946\n4.85 %\nTotal interest-earning assets\n4,820,544\n148,335\n3.08 %\n3,687,687\n115,534\n3.13 %\n2,749,138\n105,403\n3.83 %\nOther assets\n255,721\n265,893\n229,767\nTotal assets\n$ 5,076,265\n$ 3,953,580\n$ 2,978,905\nInterest bearing liabilities:\nDemand - non-interest bearing\n$ 1,256,043\n$ 926,692\n$ 555,385\nDemand - interest bearing\n2,025,420\n13,107\n0.65 %\n1,509,826\n12,645\n0.84 %\n1,184,530\n15,621\n1.32 %\nMoney market & savings\n1,162,032\n3,720\n0.32 %\n916,607\n6,247\n0.68 %\n705,445\n6,796\n0.96 %\nTime deposits\n190,960\n1,511\n0.79 %\n211,636\n3,859\n1.82 %\n190,567\n3,850\n2.02 %\nTotal deposits\n4,634,455\n18,338\n0.40 %\n3,564,761\n22,751\n0.64 %\n2,635,927\n26,267\n1.00 %\nTotal interest bearing deposits\n3,378,412\n18,338\n0.54 %\n2,638,069\n22,751\n0.86 %\n2,080,542\n26,267\n1.26 %\nOther borrowings\n22,303\n1.11 %\n30,413\n1.21 %\n22,911\n3.45 %\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities\n3,400,715\n18,591\n0.55 %\n2,668,482\n23,118\n0.87 %\n2,103,453\n27,057\n1.29 %\nTotal deposits and other borrowings\n4,656,758\n18,591\n0.40 %\n3,595,174\n23,118\n0.64 %\n2,658,838\n27,057\n1.02 %\nNon-interest bearing other liabilities\n101,473\n87,200\n71,131\nShareholders equity\n318,034\n271,206\n248,936\nTotal liabilities and shareholders equity\n$ 5,076,265\n$ 3,953,580\n$ 2,978,905\nNet interest income(2)\n$ 129,744\n$ 92,416\n$ 78,346\nNet interest spread\n2.52 %\n2.26 %\n2.54 %\nNet interest margin(2)\n2.69 %\n2.51 %\n2.85 %\n(1) Yields on investments are calculated based on amortized cost.\n(2) Net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a tax-equivalent basis, a Non-GAAP measure. Net interest income has been increased over the financial statement amount by $532, $585, and $539 in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, to adjust for tax equivalency. The tax equivalent net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by average total interest earning assets.\nRate/Volume Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income\nNet interest income may also be analyzed by segregating the volume and rate components of interest income and interest expense. The following table sets forth an analysis of volume and rate changes in net interest income for the periods indicated. For purposes of this table, changes in interest income and expense are allocated to volume and rate categories based upon the respective changes in average balances and average rates. Net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a tax equivalent basis.\nYear ended\nDecember 31, 2021 vs. 2020\nYear ended\nDecember 31, 2020 vs. 2019\nChanges due to:\nChanges due to:\n(dollars in thousands)\nAverage\nVolume\nAverage\nRate\nTotal\nChange\nAverage\nVolume\nAverage\nRate\nTotal\nChange\nInterest earned:\nFederal funds sold and other interest-earning assets\n$\n$ (203 )\n$ (61 )\n$\n$ (2,296 )\n$ (2,057 )\nSecurities\n13,843\n(2,467 )\n11,376\n(6,947 )\n(6,720 )\nLoans\n8,244\n13,242\n21,486\n32,296\n(13,388 )\n18,908\nTotal interest-earning assets\n22,229\n10,572\n32,801\n32,762\n(22,631 )\n10,131\nInterest expense:\nDeposits\nInterest-bearing demand deposits\n$\n$ (275 )\n$\n$ 2,725\n$ (5,701 )\n$ (2,976 )\nMoney market and savings\n3,337\n(5,864 )\n(2,527 )\n1,462\n(2,011 )\n(549 )\nTime deposits\n(164 )\n(2,184 )\n(2,348 )\n(375 )\nTotal deposit interest expense\n3,910\n(8,323 )\n(4,413 )\n4,571\n(8,087 )\n(3,516 )\nOther borrowings\n(28 )\n(86 )\n(114 )\n(450 )\n(423 )\nTotal interest expense\n3,882\n(8,409 )\n(4,527 )\n4,598\n(8,537 )\n(3,939 )\nNet interest income\n$ 18,347\n$ 18,981\n$ 37,328\n$ 28,164\n$ (14,094 )\n$ 14,070\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 increased by $14.1 million, or 18%, over twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Interest income on interest-earning assets totaled $115.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $10.1 million, compared to $105.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in interest income was the result of an increase in average interest-earning balances, primarily loans receivable during 2020, offset by a decrease in the average yield on interest-earning assets. Loan growth was driven by continued success with our expansion strategy driving new customer relationships, in addition to our participation in the PPP loan program. Origination fees paid by the SBA on PPP loans are also recognized as interest income over the life of the loans. We recognized approximately $6.8 million of origination fees related to PPP loans during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020. Growth in loan balances and corresponding interest income helped offset the decline in interest income driven by a lower rate environment, including interest income associated with the investment securities portfolio. A decline in mortgage interest rates resulted in a sharp increase in prepayment speeds on mortgage-backed securities held in our portfolio which caused acceleration in the amortization of premiums related to those investments.\nTotal interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 decreased $4.5 million, or 20%, to $18.6 million from $23.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Interest expense on deposits decreased by $4.4 million, or 19%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 due to lower interest rates, which was partially offset by an increase in deposit balances during 2021. Interest expense on other borrowings decreased by $114,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 due to a 10 basis point decrease in the average rate on other borrowings and an $8.1 million decrease in the average balance.\nChanges in net interest income are frequently measured by two statistics: net interest rate spread and net interest margin. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest rate spread on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 2.52% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 versus 2.26% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Net interest margin represents the difference between interest income, including net loan fees earned, and interest expense, reflected as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fully tax-equivalent net interest margin was 2.69% and 2.51%, respectively. The improvement in the net interest margin was primarily the result of the increase in interest income and a decline in the cost of funds.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nWe recorded a provision for loan losses of $5.8 million, an increase of $1.6 million, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to a $4.2 million provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The provision recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was largely associated with assumptions and estimates related to the uncertainty surrounding the economic environment, the nature of and concentration in certain credit types within the loan portfolio and loan growth for the period.\nNon-performing assets as a percentage of total assets declined to 0.24% as of December 31, 2021 compared to 0.28% as of December 31, 2020. This is the seventh consecutive year that this ratio has declined. Net (recoveries) charge-offs as a percentage of average loans also declined during 2021.\nNon-Interest Income\nTotal non-interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 decreased by $3.5 million, or 10%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Mortgage banking income totaled $12.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $5.6 million, compared to $17.6 million for the twelve months ended 2020. A decrease in the volume of residential mortgage loans originated, which was primarily due to higher market interest rates, which led to a decline in refinancing activity, which drove the decrease in mortgage banking income. We recognized gains of $2,000 on the sale or call of securities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $2.8 million, compared to gains of $2.8 million on the sales or calls of securities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, service fees on deposit accounts totaled $14.0 million, which represents an increase of $2.9 million compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. This increase was driven by growth in customer deposit accounts and transaction volume as we continue with our growth and expansion strategy. Gains on the sale of SBA loans totaled $3.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $1.5 million, compared to $1.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Loan and servicing fees totaled $3.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, which represents an increase of $39,000 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nNon-Interest Expenses\nNon-interest expenses increased by $5.1 million, or 4%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. An explanation of changes of non-interest expenses for certain categories is presented in the following paragraphs.\nSalary expenses and employee benefits for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 increased by $3.0 million, or 5%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by annual merit increases along with increased staffing levels related to our growth strategy of adding and relocating stores. There were 32 stores open as of December 31, 2021 compared to 31 stores open at December 31, 2020.\nOccupancy expense, including depreciation and amortization expense, increased by $1.3 million, or 6%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, also as a result of our continuing growth and expansion strategy.\nOther real estate owned expenses totaled $844,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $385,000, when compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. This increase was a result of higher costs to carry foreclosed assets during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nNo goodwill impairment was booked during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. Goodwill impairment totaled $5.0 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 related to the purchase of Oak Mortgage Company in 2016. During the third quarter of 2020 a goodwill impairment analysis was completed, which concluded that a write-off was required. All goodwill on the balance sheet was written off as a result of this one-time, non-cash charge.\nAll other non-interest expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 increased $5.4 million compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Increases in expenses related to data processing, professional fees, regulatory assessments and costs, other taxes, and legal were mainly associated with our growth strategy.\nOne key measure that management utilizes to monitor progress in controlling overhead expenses is the ratio of non-interest expenses to average assets. For purposes of this calculation, net non-interest expenses equal non-interest expenses less non-interest income. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the ratio was 2.41% compared to 2.97% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively. The decrease in this ratio was mainly due to the increase in average assets and the goodwill impairment charge recognized in 2020, which did not recur in 2021.\nAnother productivity measure utilized by management is the operating efficiency ratio. This ratio expresses the relationship of non-interest expenses to net interest income plus non-interest income. The efficiency ratio was 76% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to 92% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The decrease for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was due to net interest income and non-interest income increasing at a faster rate than non-interest expenses.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $8.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to a provision for income taxes of $1.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The effective tax rates for both the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was 25% and 22%.\nThe Company evaluates the carrying amount of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently, if necessary, in accordance with the guidance provided in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (ASC 740), in particular, applying the criteria set forth therein to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within its life cycle, based on the weight of available evidence. If management makes a determination based on the available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods, a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and judgments concerning managements evaluation of both positive and negative evidence.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company carefully weighed both positive and negative evidence currently available. Judgment is required when considering the relative impact of such evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of positive and negative evidence must be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified.\nThe Company is in a four-year cumulative profit position factoring in pre-tax GAAP income and permanent book/tax differences. Growth in interest-earning assets has occurred over the last several years and is expected to continue. The Company has added fourteen store locations in the past five years and since the inception of the growth and expansion strategy in 2014, almost every new store location has met or exceeded growth expectations. The success of the expansion strategy, combined with the stabilization of interest rates and continued loan growth, are expected to continue to support improvement in profitability. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has no federal NOLs to carry forward, which would have potentially been at risk of expiring in the future.\nConversely, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic to the local and global economy may result in a significant increase in future loan loss provisions and charge-offs. Rising interest rates and a downturn in the economy could significantly decrease the volume of mortgage loan originations and have a negative impact on asset quality.\nBased on the guidance provided in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (ASC 740), the Company believed that the positive evidence considered at December 31, 2021 outweighed the negative evidence and that it was more likely than not that all of the Companys deferred tax assets would be realized within their life cycle. Therefore, a valuation allowance was not required at December 31, 2021.\nThe net deferred tax asset balance was $12.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and $12.6 million as of December 31, 2019. The deferred tax asset will continue to be analyzed on a quarterly basis for changes affecting realizability.\nPreferred Dividends\nPreferred dividends of $3.5 million and $923,000 were declared and paid on preferred stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nNet Income and Net Income per Common Share\nThe net income available to shareholders for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was $21.7 million, compared to net income of $4.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, basic net income per common share was $0.37 and $0.07, respectively, and diluted net income per common share was $0.33 and $0.07, respectively.\nReturn on Average Assets and Average Equity\nReturn on average assets (ROA) measures our net income in relation to our total average assets. The ROA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was 0.50% compared to 0.13%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Return on average equity (ROE) indicates how effectively we can generate net income on the capital invested by our stockholders. ROE is calculated by dividing net income by average stockholders equity. The ROE for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was 7.92%, compared to 1.86% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nResults of Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019\nWe reported net income of $5.1 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to a net loss of $3.5 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Earnings in 2020 were positively impacted by our participation in the PPP program and the Companys focus on cost control initiatives and revenue growth.\nNet interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 increased $14.0 million to $91.8 million as compared to $77.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Growth in net interest income of $14.0 million was a result of an increase in interest income of $10.1 million and a reduction in interest expense of $3.9 million. The increase in interest income of $10.1 million, or 10%, was driven by an increase in average interest-earning assets, primarily loans receivable, offset by a decrease in the rate of average interest-earning assets. Interest expense decreased $3.9 million, or 15%, primarily due to a decrease in the rate on average interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest margin decreased by 34 basis points to 2.51% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2.85% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nWe recorded a loan loss provision of $4.2 million, an increase of $2.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to a provision of $1.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase was largely associated with assumptions and estimates related to the uncertainty surrounding the economic environment caused by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNon-interest income increased $12.5 million to $36.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $23.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in mortgage banking income, higher loan and servicing fees, an increase in service fees on deposit accounts, and gains on sale of investment securities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nNon-interest expenses increased $12.9 million to $117.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $104.5 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by a one-time charge for goodwill impairment and higher salaries, employee benefits, occupancy, and equipment expenses associated with the addition of new stores related to our expansion strategy.\nReturn on average assets and average equity were 0.13% and 1.86%, respectively, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to (0.12%) and (3.41%), respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 increased by $14.1 million, or 18%, over twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Interest income on interest-earning assets totaled $115.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $10.1 million, compared to $105.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in interest income was the result of an increase in average interest-earning balances, primarily loans receivable during 2020, offset by a decrease in the average yield on interest-earning assets. Loan growth was driven by continued success with our expansion strategy driving new customer relationships, in addition to our participation in the PPP loan program. Origination fees paid by the SBA on PPP loans are also recognized as interest income over the life of the loans. We recognized approximately $6.8 million of origination fees related to PPP loans during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020. Growth in loan balances and corresponding interest income helped offset the decline in interest income driven by a lower rate environment, including interest income associated with the investment securities portfolio. A decline in mortgage interest rates resulted in a sharp increase in prepayment speeds on mortgage-backed securities held in our portfolio which caused acceleration in the amortization of premiums related to those investments.\nTotal interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 decreased $3.9 million, or 15%, to $23.1 million from $27.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense on deposits decreased by $3.5 million, or 13%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 due to lower rates offset by increases in average deposit balances. Lower interest rates were caused by actions taken by the Federal Reserve Bank during the first quarter of 2020 in response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interest expense on other borrowings decreased by $423,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 due primarily to a decrease in the average rate on other borrowings.\nOur net interest rate spread on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 2.26% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 versus 2.54% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fully tax-equivalent net interest margin was 2.51% and 2.85%, respectively. Compression in the net interest margin was primarily driven by a 70 basis point decrease in the yield on interest earning assets resulting from the lower interest rate environment and fixed rate 1.00% loans generated through PPP lending.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nWe recorded a provision for loan losses of $4.2 million, an increase of $2.3 million, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to a $1.9 million provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The provision recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily driven by the uncertainty surrounding the economic environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative factors in the calculation of the provision for loan losses were adjusted to account for this uncertainty. While the U.S. government has taken swift action to provide stimulus and implement programs to support the economy, the long-term impact of the effect on the economy remains uncertain.\nNon-performing assets as a percentage of total assets declined to 0.28% as of December 31, 2020 compared to 0.42% as of December 31, 2019. This is the sixth consecutive year that this ratio has declined. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans also declined during 2020.\nNon-Interest Income\nTotal non-interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 increased by $12.5 million, or 53%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Mortgage banking income totaled $17.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $7.5 million, compared to $10.1 million for the twelve months ended 2019. An increase in the volume of residential mortgage loans due to a decline in interest rates drove the increase in mortgage banking income. Loan and servicing fees totaled $2.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, which represents an increase of $1.4 million compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, service fees on deposit accounts totaled $11.1 million, which represents an increase of $3.5 million compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by growth in customer deposit accounts and transaction volume as we continue with our growth and expansion strategy. We recognized gains of $2.8 million on the sale of securities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.7 million, compared to gains of $1.1 million on the sales of securities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Gains on the sale of SBA loans totaled $1.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $1.4 million, versus $3.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Lower origination volumes related to SBA loans was caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNon-Interest Expenses\nNon-interest expenses increased by $12.9 million, or 12%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. An explanation of changes of non-interest expenses for certain categories is presented in the following paragraphs.\nSalary expenses and employee benefits for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 increased by $2.4 million, or 4%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by annual merit increases along with increased staffing levels related to our growth strategy of adding and relocating stores. There were 31 stores open as of December 31, 2020 compared to 29 stores open at December 31, 2019. The increase was also a result of higher commissions paid to residential mortgage lenders as a result of growth in the volume of mortgage loan originations.\nOccupancy expense, including depreciation and amortization expense, increased by $4.2 million, or 23%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, also as a result of our continuing growth and expansion strategy. The full year impact of the two new stores opened in New York City during 2019 was recognized in 2020.\nOther real estate owned expenses totaled $459,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $1.7 million, when compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was a result of lower costs to carry foreclosed assets during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nGoodwill impairment totaled $5.0 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. During the third quarter of 2020 a goodwill impairment analysis was completed, which concluded that a write-off was required. All goodwill on the balance sheet, which was related to the acquisition of Oak Mortgage Company in 2016, was written off as a result of this one-time, non-cash charge for goodwill impairment.\nAll other non-interest expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 increased $3.0 million compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Increases in expenses related to data processing, debit card processing, professional fees, and regulatory assessments and costs were mainly associated with our growth strategy.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the ratio was 2.97% compared to 2.71% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively. The increase in this ratio was mainly due to our growth and expansion strategy.\nThe efficiency ratio was 91.69% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to 102.90% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The decrease for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was due to net interest income and non-interest income increasing at a faster rate than non-interest expenses.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $1.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to a benefit of $1.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The effective tax rates for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 22% and (28%), respectively. The effect of permanent deductions increases the effective tax benefit percentage when in a pre-tax loss position and decreases the effective tax rate when in a pre-tax income position. The impact of these permanent differences on the effective tax rate is proportional to the level of the non-taxable income in relation to pre-tax income.\nThe Company evaluates the carrying amount of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently, if necessary, in accordance with the guidance provided in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (ASC 740), in particular, applying the criteria set forth therein to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within its life cycle, based on the weight of available evidence. If management makes a determination based on the available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods, a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and judgments concerning managements evaluation of both positive and negative evidence.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company carefully weighed both positive and negative evidence currently available. Judgment is required when considering the relative impact of such evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of positive and negative evidence must be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified.\nThe Company is in a three-year cumulative profit position factoring in pre-tax GAAP income and permanent book/tax differences. Growth in interest-earning assets is expected to continue, supported by the capital raise completed during 2020. The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets along with other credit quality metrics continue to improve. A number of cost control measures have been implemented to offset the challenges faced in growing revenue as a result of compression in the net interest margin. The Company has added thirteen store locations in the past four years and since the inception of the growth and expansion strategy in 2014, almost every new store location has met or exceeded expectations. The success of the expansion strategy, combined with the stabilization of interest rates and continued loan growth, are expected to continue to support improvement in profitability going forward. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has no federal NOLs to carry forward which could expire in the future.\nConversely, the Companys net interest margin declined during 2020 as a result of the challenging interest rate environment. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic to the local and global economy may result in a significant increase in future loan loss provisions and charge-offs. Rising interest rates and a downturn in the economy could significantly decrease the volume of mortgage loan originations.\nBased on the guidance provided in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (ASC 740), the Company believed that the positive evidence considered at December 31, 2020 outweighed the negative evidence and that it was more likely than not that all of the Companys deferred tax assets would be realized within their life cycle. Therefore, a valuation allowance was not required at December 31, 2020.\nThe net deferred tax asset balance was $12.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and $12.6 million as of December 31, 2019. The deferred tax asset will continue to be analyzed on a quarterly basis for changes affecting realizability.\nPreferred Dividends\nPreferred dividends of $923,000 were declared and paid on preferred stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nNet Income and Net Income per Common Share\nThe net income available to shareholders for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $4.1 million, compared to a net loss of $3.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, basic and fully diluted net income per common share was $0.07, compared to basic and fully diluted net loss per common share of $0.06 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nReturn on Average Assets and Average Equity\nThe ROA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 0.13% and (0.12%), respectively. Return on average equity The ROE for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was 1.86%, compared to (1.41%) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nFinancial Condition\nDecember 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020\nTotal assets increased by $560.9 million, or 11%, to $5.6 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2020. In addition to our ongoing success with our expansion strategy, the growth in assets was also driven by our participation in the PPP loan program, which resulted in a significant increase in new business relationships and account openings in 2021. A more detailed discussion of changes in the balance sheet accounts can be found in the following paragraphs.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and due from banks and interest bearing deposits comprise this category, which consists of our most liquid assets. The aggregate amount in these three categories decreased by $656.4 million to $118.9 million at December 31, 2021, from $775.3 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease as of December 31, 2021 was caused by repayment of short-term borrowings in the amount of $633.9 million related to the PPP loan program in 2020.\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans held for sale are comprised of loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and residential mortgage loans, both of which we intend to sell in the future. Total SBA loans held for sale were $5.2 million and $3.0 million at both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Residential mortgage loans held for sale amounted to $8.5 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $41.8 million, compared to $50.4 million at December 31, 2020. A decrease in the volume of residential mortgage loans during 2021 drove the decrease in residential mortgage loans held for sale as of December 31, 2021. Loans held for sale, as a percentage of our total assets, were less than 1% at December 31, 2021.\nRestricted Stock\nRestricted stock, which represents a required investment in the capital stock of correspondent banks related to available credit facilities, is carried at cost as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. As of those dates, restricted stock consisted of investments in the capital stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLB) and Atlantic Community Bankers Bank (ACBB).\nAt December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the investment in FHLB stock totaled $3.4 million and $2.9 million, respectively. The $471,000 increase was due to a higher required investment in FHLB stock during 2021. At both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, ACBB stock totaled $143,000.\nPremises and Equipment\nThe balance of premises and equipment increased to $127.4 million at December 31, 2021 from $123.2 million at December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to premises and equipment expenditures of $12.7 million reduced by depreciation and amortization expense of $8.4 million during 2021. The expenditures made during 2021 primarily relate to the construction of new store locations in addition to normal investments in hardware, software and other operating equipment. A new store was opened in Deptford, New Jersey bringing the total store count to thirty-two at December 31, 2021.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nThe balance of other real estate owned decreased to $360,000 at December 31, 2021 from $1.2 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily the result of valuation adjustments and dispositions totaling $1.2 million offset by additions of $360,000 during 2021.\nOperating Leases - Right of Use Asset\nUnder ASC 842, the right-of-use asset is valued as the initial amount of the lease liability obligation adjusted for any initial direct costs, prepaid or accrued rent, and any lease incentives. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the balance of the operating lease right-of-use asset was $75.6 million and $72.9 million, respectively.\nGoodwill\nIn connection with the review of our financial condition in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we evaluated our assets, including goodwill and other intangibles for potential impairment on an interim basis at the end of each quarter during 2020. Goodwill was written off as a result of an interim test completed as of September 30, 2020. This was a complete write-off of all goodwill on the balance sheet. There was no goodwill on the balance sheet at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nInvestment Securities Portfolio\nRepublics investment securities portfolio is intended to provide liquidity and contribute to earnings while diversifying credit risk. We attempt to maximize earnings while minimizing our exposure to interest rate risk. Investment securities available for sale are investments that may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions, and for liquidity and other purposes. Our debt securities consist primarily of U.S. Government agency SBA bonds, U.S. Government agency collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO), agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), municipal securities, and corporate bonds. Investment securities available for sale totaled $1.1 billion at December 31, 2021 as compared to $529 million at December 31, 2020. The $547 million increase was primarily due to the purchase of securities totaling $706 million partially offset by the paydowns, maturities, and calls of securities totaling $142 million during 2021. At December 31, 2021, the portfolio had a net unrealized loss of $12 million compared to a net unrealized gain of $1 million at December 31, 2020. The $12.9 million decrease in the unrealized gain/(loss) of the investment portfolio was driven by an increase in market interest rates, which drove a decrease in value of the securities held in our portfolio during 2021.\nInvestment securities held-to-maturity are investments for which there is the intent and ability to hold the investment to maturity. These investments are carried at amortized cost. The held-to-maturity portfolio consists primarily of U.S. Government agency Small Business Investment Company bonds (SBIC) and SBA bonds, CMOs and MBSs. The fair value of securities held-to-maturity totaled $1.6 billion and $837.0 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The $810.4 million increase was primarily due to the purchase of securities held to maturity totaling $1.1 billion partially offset by the paydowns, maturities, and calls of securities held in the portfolio totaling $269.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nASC 320 Investments - Debt Securities requires an entity to determine how to classify a security at the time of acquisition. The appropriateness of the original classification should be reassessed at each reporting period. The transfer of investment securities from available-for-sale to held-to maturity category during the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was completed after an extensive analysis of the characteristics of all securities held in the portfolio, in addition to a review of our liquidity position under multiple scenarios including varying interest rate environments. Twenty-three of the twenty-five securities transferred from available-to-sale to held-to-maturity were collateralized mortgage obligations. Thirteen securities transferred were GNMA collateralized mortgage obligations which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The remaining ten collateralized mortgage obligations were issued by FNMA or FHLMC. Bonds issued by GNMA receive favorable risk rating when calculating regulatory risk-based capital ratios. In addition, GNMA, FNMA, and FHLMC securities are often pledged as collateral as required to hold certain government deposits and are accepted as collateral as a result of the high quality and low-risk nature of these bonds. The other two securities transferred from available-for sale to held-to-maturity were FNMA agency mortgage-backed securities.\nAfter completion of these analyses and consideration of the factors mentioned above, management determined that it had the intent and ability to hold specific securities until maturity and it was appropriate to transfer them to the held-to-maturity category during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nThe fair value of the securities transferred to the held-to-maturity category was $230.1 million. The book value of the securities on the date of transfer was $239.5 million. The unrealized holding gain or loss on each individual security calculated at the time of transfer was reported as a component of shareholders equity in the accumulated other comprehensive income account and will be amortized as an adjustment to yield over the remaining life of each security.\nEquity securities consist of investments in the preferred stock of domestic banks. Equity securities are held at fair value. The fair value of equity securities at December 31, 2021 totaled $9.2 million compared to $9.0 million at December 31, 2020.\nA summary of investment securities available for sale at fair value, investment securities held-to-maturity, and equity securities at December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows:\nAt December 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\nInvestment securities available for sale\nU.S. Government agencies\n$ 25,671\n$ 32,312\n$ 38,743\nCollateralized mortgage obligations\n375,570\n218,232\n329,492\nAgency mortgage-backed securities\n446,740\n149,325\n98,953\nMunicipal securities\n6,596\n8,201\n4,064\nCorporate bonds\n232,395\n119,118\n69,499\nAmortized cost of investment securities available for sale\n$ 1,086,972\n$ 527,188\n$ 540,751\nFair value of investment securities available for sale\n$ 1,075,366\n$ 528,508\n$ 539,042\nInvestment securities held to maturity\nU.S. Government agencies\n$ 66,438\n$ 82,093\n$ 94,913\nCollateralized mortgage obligations\n400,424\n363,363\n416,177\nAgency mortgage-backed securities\n1,193,430\n369,480\n133,752\nAmortized cost of investment securities held to maturity\n$ 1,660,292\n$ 814,936\n$ 644,842\nFair value of investment securities held to maturity\n$ 1,647,360\n$ 836,972\n$ 653,109\nEquity Securities\n$ 9,173\n$ 9,039\n$ -\nThe total amortized cost of the investment securities portfolio has grown to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2020, and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2019. Investment securities represented 49% of total assets at December 31, 2021 and 27% of total assets at December 31, 2020. We evaluate our investment securities portfolio in light of the interest rate environment and changing market conditions and when appropriate, take necessary actions to improve and enhance our overall positioning. We consider the portfolio to be well structured and of high quality. At December 31, 2021, 95% of the portfolio consisted of U.S. government debt securities or U.S. government agency issued mortgage-backed securities which were rated Aaa /AA+ by the major credit rating agencies.\nThe investment securities portfolio includes investment securities classified as both available for sale and held to maturity and equity securities at fair value.\nThe fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of investment securities generally decreases when interest rates rise and increases when interest rates fall. In addition, the fair value generally decreases when credit spreads widen and increases when credit spreads tighten. Net unrealized losses in the investment securities portfolio were $24.5 million at December 31, 2021 compared to net unrealized gains of $23.4 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was a result of an increase in market interest rates in 2021. The available for sale portfolio had unrealized losses of $11.6 million at December 31, 2021 and unrealized gains of $1.3 million at December 31, 2020. The held to maturity portfolio had unrealized losses of $12.9 million at December 31, 2021 and unrealized gains of $22.0 million at December 31, 2020.\nWe held four U.S. Government agency securities, 27 collateralized mortgage obligations and sixty-one agency mortgage-backed securities that were in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2021. Principal and interest payments of the underlying collateral for each of these securities carry minimal credit risk. Management found no evidence of other than temporary impairment (OTTI) on any of these securities and believes the unrealized losses are due to fluctuations in fair values resulting from changes in market interest rates and are considered temporary as of December 31, 2021.\nAt December 31, 2021, the investment portfolio included eight municipal securities with a total market value of $6.9 million. These securities are reviewed quarterly for impairment. Each bond carries an investment grade rating by either Moodys or Standard & Poors. In addition, we periodically conduct our own independent review on each issuer to ensure the financial stability of the municipal entity. The largest geographic concentration was in New Jersey where six municipal securities had a market value of $6.2 million. As of December 31, 2021, management found no evidence of OTTI on any of the municipal securities held in the investment securities portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2021, the investment portfolio included fifteen corporate bonds that were in an unrealized loss position. Management believes the unrealized losses on these securities were also driven by changes in market interest rates and not a result of credit deterioration. Seven of the fifteen corporate bonds are issued by four of the largest U.S. financial institutions. Each financial institution is well capitalized.\nThere were no proceeds from the sale of securities during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021. A gain of $2,000 was realized on the call of securities. The tax provision applicable to the gain of $2,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to $1,000.\nProceeds associated with the sale of securities available for sale in 2020 were $125.2 million. Gross gains of $3.0 million and gross losses of $230,000 were realized on these sales. The tax provision applicable to the net gains of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to $700,000.\nProceeds associated with the sale of securities available for sale in 2019 were $54.7 million. Gross gains of $1.2 million and gross losses of $67,000 were realized on these sales. The tax provision applicable to the net gains of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to $280,000.\nThe following table presents the maturity distribution and weighted average yield by holding type and year of maturity of our investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2021. Collateralized mortgage obligations and agency mortgage-backed securities have expected maturities that differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to call or prepay and, therefore, these securities are classified separately with no specific maturity date. Equity securities are at fair value.\nDecember 31, 2021\nWithin\nOne Year\nOne to\nFive Years\nFive to Ten\nYears\nPast Ten\nYears\nNo Specific\nMaturity\nTotal\n(dollars in thousands)\nAmount\nYield\nAmount\nYield\nAmount\nYield\nAmount\nYield\nAmount\nYield\nFair\nvalue\nAmortized\nCost\nYield\nAvailable for Sale\nU.S. Government Agencies\n$ -\n-\n$ 24,928\n0.93 %\n$ -\n-\n$ -\n-\n$ -\n-\n$ 24,928\n$ 25,671\n0.93 %\nCollateralized mortgage obligations\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n371,549\n1.66 %\n371,549\n375,570\n1.66 %\nAgency mortgage-backed securities\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n441,483\n1.68 %\n441,483\n446,740\n1.68 %\nMunicipal securities\n4.14 %\n4.10 %\n5,857\n2.97 %\n-\n-\n-\n-\n6,940\n6,596\n3.16 %\nCorporate bonds\n33,420\n2.59 %\n76,733\n2.89 %\n26,242\n2.22 %\n94,071\n2.08 %\n-\n-\n230,466\n232,395\n2.44 %\nTotal AFS securities\n$ 34,157\n2.63 %\n$ 102,007\n2.42 %\n$ 32,099\n2.36 %\n$ 94,071\n2.08 %\n$ 813,032\n1.67 %\n$ 1,075,366\n$ 1,086,972\n1.73 %\nHeld to Maturity\nU.S. Government Agencies\n$\n2.58 %\n$ 67,983\n2.47 %\n$ -\n-\n$ -\n-\n$ -\n-\n$ 67,987\n$ 66,438\n2.47 %\nCollateralized mortgage obligations\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n396,228\n1.77 %\n396,228\n400,424\n1.77 %\nAgency mortgage-backed securities\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n1,183,145\n1.78 %\n1,183,145\n1,193,430\n1.78 %\nTotal HTM securities\n$\n2.58 %\n$ 67,983\n2.47 %\n$ -\n-\n$ -\n-\n$ 1,579,373\n1.78 %\n$ 1,647,360\n$ 1,660,292\n1.81 %\nEquity Securities\n$ -\n-\n$ -\n-\n$ -\n-\n$ -\n-\n$ 9,173\n-\n$ 9,173\n$ -\n-\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nManagement uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of our financial instruments; however, there are inherent weaknesses in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we could have realized in a sale transaction on the dates indicated. The estimated fair value amounts have been measured as of their respective year-ends and have not been re-evaluated or updated for purposes of these financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each year-end.\nWe follow the guidance issued under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and identifies required disclosures on fair value measurements.\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methods used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are as follows:\nLevel 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported with little or no market activity).\nAn assets or liabilitys level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe fair value of securities available for sale (carried at fair value) and held to maturity (carried at amortized cost) are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1), or matrix pricing (Level 2), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted prices. For certain securities, which are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, and such adjustments, are generally based on available market evidence (Level 3). In the absence of such evidence, managements best estimate is used. Managements best estimate consists of both internal and external support on certain Level 3 investments. Internal cash flow models using a present value formula that includes assumptions market participants would use along with indicative exit pricing obtained from broker/dealers (where available) were used to support fair values of certain Level 3 investments.\nThe types of instruments valued based on matrix pricing in active markets include all of our U.S. government and agency securities, corporate bonds, and municipal obligations. Such instruments are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. As required by ASC 820-10, we do not adjust the matrix pricing for such instruments.\nLevel 3 is for positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, and may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, with such adjustment generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, managements best estimate is used. Subsequent to inception, management only changes Level 3 inputs and assumptions when corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar instruments, completed or pending third-party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities, subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure, offerings in the equity or debt markets, and changes in financial ratios or cash flows. There was one Level 3 investment security classified as available-for-sale at December 31, 2021. This security is a corporate bond.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the securities available for sale measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n(dollars in thousands)\nLevel 3 Investments Only\nCorporate\nBonds\nCorporate\nBonds\nCorporate\nBonds\nBalance, January 1st\n$ 2,631\n$ 2,820\n$ 3,069\nUnrealized gains (losses)\n(6 )\n(189 )\n(249 )\nProceeds from sales\n-\n-\n-\nRealized losses\n-\n-\n-\nBalance, December 31st\n$ 2,625\n$ 2,631\n$ 2,820\nThe Level 3 investment security classified as available for sale is a corporate bond that is not actively traded. Impairment would depend on the repayment ability of the underlying issuer, which is assessed through a detailed quarterly review of the issuers financial statements. The issuer is a well capitalized financial institution as defined by federal banking regulations and has demonstrated the ability to raise additional capital, when necessary, through the public capital markets. The fair value of this corporate bond is estimated by obtaining a price of a comparable floating rate debt instrument through Bloomberg.\nLoan Portfolio\nLoans Receivable\nThe loan portfolio represents our largest asset category and is our most significant source of interest income. Our lending strategy is focused on small- and medium-sized businesses and professionals that seek highly personalized banking services. The loan portfolio consists of secured and unsecured commercial loans including commercial real estate, construction loans, residential mortgages, home improvement loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, overdraft lines of credit, PPP loans and others. Commercial loans are primarily secured term loans made to small to medium-sized businesses and professionals for working capital, asset acquisition and other purposes. Commercial loans typically range between $250,000 and $5 million, but customers may borrow significantly larger amounts up to our legal lending limit to a customer, which was approximately $51.2 million at December 31, 2021. Loans made to one individual customer, even if secured by different collateral, are aggregated for purposes of the lending limit. There were no loans in excess of the legal lending limit at December 31, 2021. A $34 million threshold, which amounts to approximately 10% of total regulatory capital, reflects an additional internal monitoring guideline. We had one loan relationship in excess of $34 million at December 31, 2021. The internal monitoring guideline in place as of December 31, 2020 was $30 million. We had no loan relationships in excess of that guideline at December 31, 2020.\nThe majority of loans outstanding are with borrowers in our marketplace, Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs, Southern New Jersey, and New York City. Repayment of our loans is in part dependent upon general economic conditions affecting our market place and specific industries in which our customers operate. We evaluate each customers credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained is based on managements credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral varies but primarily includes residential, commercial and income-producing properties.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had loan concentrations exceeding 10% of total loans for credits extended to lessors of nonresidential real estate in the aggregate amount of $509.2 million, which represented 20% of gross loans receivable. Loan concentrations are considered to exist when amounts are loaned to multiple numbers of borrowers engaged in similar activities that management believes would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At December 31, 2021, we had no foreign loans outstanding.\nLoans decreased $143.9 million, or 5%, to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2021, versus $2.6 billion at December 31, 2020. Loans originated through the PPP loan program continue to be repaid or forgiven by the SBA, which offsets the growth experienced in other categories in the portfolio. Excluding the impact of the PPP loans, which decreased by $517.6 million in 2021, gross loans increased by $374 million, or 18%, to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2020. We continue to see results from the continued success with our relationship banking model which has driven a steady flow in quality loan demand. We experienced strongest growth in the commercial and industrial, construction and land development, owner-occupied real estate, commercial real estate and residential mortgage categories during 2021.\nThe following table sets forth gross loans by major categories for the periods indicated:\nAt December 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\nCommercial real estate\n$ 780,311\n$ 705,748\n$ 613,631\n$ 515,738\n$ 433,304\nConstruction and land development\n216,008\n142,821\n121,395\n121,042\n104,617\nCommercial and industrial\n252,376\n200,188\n223,906\n200,423\n173,343\nOwner occupied real estate\n526,570\n475,206\n424,400\n367,895\n309,838\nConsumer and other\n83,487\n102,368\n101,320\n91,152\n76,183\nResidential mortgage\n536,332\n395,174\n263,444\n140,364\n64,764\nPaycheck protection program\n119,039\n636,637\n-\n-\n-\nTotal loans\n$ 2,514,123\n$ 2,658,142\n$ 1,748,096\n$ 1,436,614\n$ 1,162,049\nDeferred loan costs (fees)\n(6,758 )\n(12,800 )\n(16 )\nTotal loans, net of deferred loan fees\n$ 2,507,365\n$ 2,645,342\n$ 1,748,195\n$ 1,436,598\n$ 1,162,278\nTotal loans, net of deferred loan costs, decreased $138 million, or 5%, to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2021, versus $2.6 billion at December 31, 2020. This decrease was due to a $517.6 million reduction in PPP loans. Excluding the impact of the PPP loan program, loans grew $374 million, or 18%, year over year.\nLoan Maturity and Interest Rate Sensitivity\nThe amount of loans outstanding by category as of the dates indicated, which are due in: (i) one year or less, (ii) more than one year through five years, and (iii) over five years, is shown in the following table.

At December 31, 2021, 85% of total loans were fixed rate compared to 89% at December 31, 2020.\nLoss Mitigation and Loan Portfolio Analysis\nWe took a proactive approach to analyze and prepare for the potential challenges to be faced as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic began to impact our customers. A detailed analysis of loan concentrations and segments that present the areas of highest risk was prepared and was closely monitored. Our commercial lending team initiated contact with a majority of our loan customers to discuss the impact that the pandemic crisis had on their businesses and the expected ramifications that could be felt in the future. We executed loan modifications and initiated payment deferrals for all customers that had an immediate need for assistance.\nPursuant to the CARES Act, loan modifications made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of (i) December 30, 2020 or (ii) 60 days after the President declared a termination of the COVID-19 national emergency were not classified as TDRs if the related loans were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. In December 2020, the Economic Aid Act was signed into law which amended certain sections of the CARES Act. This amendment extended the period to suspend the requirements under TDR accounting guidance to the earlier of i) January 1, 2022 or ii) 60 days after the President declares a termination of the national emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2021, there were no loan customers deferring loan payments, and all customers that were granted deferrals to assist during the height of the COVID pandemic have resumed contractual payments. At December 31, 2020, 21 customers with outstanding balances of $16 million, were deferring loan payments. At December 31, 2020, deferrals were comprised of the following categories: 90 day deferrals amounted to eight customers with outstanding balances of $3 million and second deferrals amounted to thirteen customers with outstanding balances of $13 million.\nAs a result of the changes in economic conditions driven by the COVID pandemic, we increased the qualitative factors for certain components of our allowance for loan loss calculation. We also took into consideration the probable impact that the various stimulus initiatives provided through the CARES Act, along with other government programs, could have to assist borrowers during this period of economic stress. We believe the combination of ongoing communication with our customers, relatively loan-to-value ratios on underlying collateral, loan payment deferrals, increased focus on risk management practices, and access to government programs such as the PPP, successfully mitigated potential losses. While economic conditions have improved, we will continue to closely monitor key economic indicators and our internal asset quality metrics as the effects of the coronavirus pandemic may still impact our customer base if new variants of the virus arise. The provision for loan losses and charge-offs may be impacted in future periods.\nCredit Quality\nRepublics written lending policies require specific underwriting, loan documentation and credit analysis standards to be met prior to funding, with independent credit department approval for the majority of new loan balances. A committee consisting of senior management and certain members of the Board of Directors oversees the loan approval process to monitor that proper standards are maintained, while approving the majority of commercial loans.\nLoans, including impaired loans, are generally classified as non-accrual if they are past due as to maturity or payment of interest or principal for a period of more than 90 days, unless such loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than 90 days may also be classified as non-accrual if repayment of principal and/or interest in full is in doubt. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time, and there is a sustained period of repayment performance by the borrower, in accordance with the contractual terms.\nWhile a loan is classified as non-accrual, any collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to principal outstanding. When the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is expected, interest income may be recognized on a cash basis. For non-accrual loans, which have been partially charged off, recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate. Cash interest receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge-offs have been fully recovered.\nThe following summary shows information concerning loan delinquency and non-performing assets at the dates indicated:\nAt December 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\nLoans accruing, but past due 90 days or more\n$\n$\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nNon-accrual loans:\nCommercial real estate\n4,493\n4,421\n4,159\n4,631\n8,963\nConstruction and land development\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nCommercial and industrial\n2,558\n2,963\n3,087\n3,661\n2,895\nOwner occupied real estate\n3,714\n2,859\n3,337\n1,188\n2,136\nConsumer and other\n1,075\n1,302\n1,062\nResidential mortgage\n-\n-\nPaycheck Protection Program\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal non-accrual loans\n12,541\n12,246\n12,413\n10,341\n14,845\nTotal non-performing loans\n12,864\n12,858\n12,413\n10,341\n14,845\nOther real estate owned\n1,188\n1,730\n6,223\n6,966\nTotal non-performing assets\n$ 13,224\n$ 14,046\n$ 14,143\n$ 16,564\n$ 21,811\nNon-performing loans as a percentage of total loans, net of unearned income\n0.51 %\n0.49 %\n0.71 %\n0.72 %\n1.28 %\nNon-performing assets as a percentage of total assets\n0.24 %\n0.28 %\n0.42 %\n0.60 %\n0.94 %\nProblem loans can consist of loans that are performing, but for which potential credit problems of the borrowers have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to continue to comply with present repayment terms. At December 31, 2021, all identified problem loans included in the preceding table are internally classified and have been evaluated for a specific reserve allocation in the allowance for loan losses (see discussion on Allowance for Loan Losses).\nNon-performing assets decreased by $822 thousand, or 6%, to $13.2 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $14.0 million at December 31, 2020. Non-performing loans of $12.9 million at December 31,2021 were equivalent to non-performing loans at December 31, 2020. The reduction in other real estate owned was the result of the disposition of four OREO properties for a total of $1.2 million offset by the addition of two properties for a total of $360,000.\nThe following summary shows the impact on interest income of non-accrual loans, subsequent to being placed on non-accrual for the periods indicated:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\nInterest income that would have been recorded had the loans been in accordance with their original terms\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nInterest income included in net income\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish an allowance against loan losses on a quarterly basis. When an increase in this allowance is necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings. The allowance for loan losses consists of three components. The first component is allocated to individually evaluated loans found to be impaired and is calculated in accordance with ASC 310 Receivables. The second component is allocated to all other loans that are not individually identified as impaired pursuant to ASC 310-10 (non-impaired loans). This component is calculated for all non-impaired loans on a collective basis in accordance with ASC 450 Contingencies. The third component is an unallocated allowance to account for a level of imprecision in managements estimation process.\nWe evaluate loans for impairment and potential charge-off on a quarterly basis. Management regularly monitors the condition of borrowers and assesses both internal and external factors in determining whether any loan relationships have deteriorated. Any loan rated as substandard or lower will have an individual collateral evaluation analysis prepared to determine if a deficiency exists. We first evaluate the primary repayment source. If the primary repayment source is determined to be insufficient and unlikely to repay the debt, we then look to the secondary repayment sources. Secondary sources are conservatively reviewed for liquidation values. Updated appraisals and financial data are obtained to substantiate current values. If the reviewed sources are deemed to be inadequate to cover the outstanding principal and any costs associated with the resolution of a troubled loan, an estimate of the deficient amount will be calculated and a specific allocation of loan loss reserve is recorded.\nFactors considered in the calculation of the allowance for non-impaired loans include several qualitative and quantitative factors such as historical loss experience, trends in delinquency and nonperforming loan balances, changes in risk composition and underwriting standards, experience and ability of management, and general economic conditions along with other external factors. Historical loss experience is analyzed by reviewing charge-offs over a three-year period to determine loss rates consistent with the loan categories depicted in the allowance for loan loss table below.\nThe entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses in the loan portfolio and related commitment portfolio. Our principal focus, therefore, is on the adequacy of the total allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is subject to review by banking regulators on a regular basis. Our primary bank regulators regularly conduct examinations of the allowance for loan losses and may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.\nA detailed analysis of our allowance for loan losses for the years indicated is as follows:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\nBalance at beginning of period\n$ 12,975\n$ 9,266\n$ 8,615\n$ 8,599\n$ 9,155\nCharge-offs:\nCommercial real estate\n-\n-\n1,603\n-\nConstruction and land development\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nCommercial and industrial\n1,356\n1,366\nOwner occupied real estate\n-\n-\nConsumer and other\nResidential mortgage\n-\n-\n-\n-\nPaycheck Protection Program\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal charge-offs\n1,482\n2,438\n1,576\nRecoveries:\nCommercial real estate\n-\n-\nConstruction and land development\n-\n-\n-\n-\nCommercial and industrial\nOwner occupied real estate\n-\nConsumer and other\nResidential mortgage\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nPaycheck Protection Program\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal recoveries\nNet (recoveries) charge-offs\n(239 )\n1,254\n2,284\n1,456\nProvision for loan losses\n5,750\n4,200\n1,905\n2,300\nBalance at end of period\n$ 18,964\n$ 12,975\n$ 9,266\n$ 8,615\n$ 8,599\nAverage loans outstanding(1)\n$ 2,577,498\n$ 2,359,169\n$ 1,544,904\n$ 1,340,117\n$ 1,090,851\nAs a percent of average loans:(1)\nNet charge-offs\n(0.01% )\n0.02 %\n0.08 %\n0.17 %\n0.13 %\nProvision for loan losses\n0.22 %\n0.18 %\n0.12 %\n0.17 %\n0.08 %\nAllowance for loan losses\n0.74 %\n0.55 %\n0.60 %\n0.64 %\n0.79 %\nAllowance for loan losses to:\nTotal loans, net of unearned income\n0.79 %\n0.49 %\n0.53 %\n0.60 %\n0.74 %\nTotal non-performing loans\n147.42 %\n100.91 %\n74.65 %\n83.31 %\n57.93 %\n(1) Includes non-accruing loans.\nThe provision for loan losses is charged to operations in an amount necessary to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that management believes is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio. We recorded a loan loss provision of $5.8 million in 2021 compared to a $4.2 million provision in 2020. The increase was primarily caused by the uncertainty surrounding the economic environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative factors in the calculation of the provision for loan losses were adjusted to account for this uncertainty.\nThe ratio of non-performing assets to total assets declined to 0.24% as of December 31, 2021 compared to 0.28% as of December 31, 2020. Net (recoveries) charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding declined to (0.01%) for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 0.02% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-performing loans (coverage ratio) was 147% at December 31, 2021 as compared to 101% at December 31, 2020 and 75% at December 31, 2019. All loans individually evaluated for impairment are adequately secured with collateral and/or specific reserves. Coverage is considered adequate by management as of December 31, 2021.\nManagement makes at least a quarterly determination as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The Board of Directors periodically reviews the status of all non-accrual and impaired loans and loans classified by the management team. The Board of Directors also considers specific loans, pools of similar loans, historical charge-off activity, economic conditions and other relevant factors in reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Any additions deemed necessary to the allowance for loan losses are charged to operating expenses.\nWe evaluate loans for impairment and potential charge-offs on a quarterly basis. Any loan rated as substandard or lower will have a collateral evaluation analysis completed in accordance with the guidance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) on impaired loans to determine if a deficiency exists. Our credit monitoring process assesses the ultimate collectability of an outstanding loan balance from all potential sources. When a loan is determined to be uncollectible it is charged-off against the allowance for loan losses. Unsecured commercial loans and all consumer loans are charged-off immediately upon reaching the 90-day delinquency mark unless they are well secured and in the process of collection. The timing on charge-offs of all other loan types is subjective and will be recognized when management determines that full repayment, either from the cash flow of the borrower, collateral sources, and/or guarantors, will not be sufficient and that repayment is unlikely. A full or partial charge-off is recognized equal to the amount of the estimated deficiency calculation.\nSerious delinquency is often the first indicator of a potential charge-off. Reductions in appraised collateral values and deteriorating financial condition of borrowers and guarantors are factors considered when evaluating potential charge-offs. The likelihood of possible recoveries or improvements in a borrowers financial condition is also assessed when considering a charge-off.\nPartial charge-offs of non-performing and impaired loans can significantly reduce the coverage ratio and other credit loss statistics due to the fact that the balance of the allowance for loan losses will be reduced while still carrying the remainder of a non-performing loan balance in the impaired loan category. The amount of non-performing loans for which partial charge-offs have been recorded during the year amounted to $403,000 at December 31, 2021 compared to $1.1 million at December 31, 2020. Our charge-off policy is reviewed on an annual basis and updated as necessary. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, there have been no changes made to this policy.\nWe have an existing loan review program, which monitors the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis. A loan review officer who reviews both the loan portfolio and overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses conducts this loan review on a quarterly basis and reports directly to the Board of Directors.\nEstimating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses at any given date is difficult, particularly in a continually changing economy. In managements opinion, the allowance for loan losses was appropriate at December 31, 2021. However, there can be no assurance that, if asset quality deteriorates in future periods, additions to the allowance for loan losses will not be required.\nThe following schedule sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories. The allocation is based on managements evaluation of historical charge-off experience and adjusted for several qualitative factors. The entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb loan losses in any loan category.\nThe allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the past five years is as follows:\nAt December 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\nAmount\n% of Loans\nAmount\n% of Loans\nAmount\n% of Loans\nAmount\n% of Loans\nAmount\n% of Loans\nCommercial real estate\n$ 5,802\n31.0 %\n$ 4,394\n26.6 %\n$ 3,043\n35.1 %\n$ 2,462\n35.9 %\n$ 3,774\n37.3 %\nConstruction and land development\n1,544\n8.6 %\n5.4 %\n6.9 %\n8.4 %\n9.0 %\nCommercial and industrial\n2,856\n10.1 %\n1,367\n7.5 %\n12.8 %\n1,754\n14.0 %\n1,317\n14.9 %\nOwner occupied real estate\n3,158\n21.0 %\n2,374\n17.9 %\n2,292\n24.3 %\n2,033\n25.6 %\n1,737\n26.7 %\nConsumer and other\n3.3 %\n3.9 %\n5.8 %\n6.3 %\n6.5 %\nResidential mortgage\n4,922\n21.3 %\n3,025\n14.9 %\n1,705\n15.1 %\n9.8 %\n5.6 %\nPaycheck Protection Program\n-\n4.7 %\n-\n24.0 %\n-\n- %\n-\n- %\n-\n- %\nUnallocated\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal allowance for loan losses\n$ 18,964\n%\n$ 12,975\n%\n$ 9,266\n%\n$ 8,615\n%\n$ 8,599\n%\nWe provide specific reserves for impaired loans to the extent the estimated realizable value of the underlying collateral is less than the loan balance, when the collateral is the only source of repayment. Also, we estimate and recognize reserve allocations on loans identified as internally classified accruing loans based upon any factor that might impact loss estimates. Those factors include but are not limited to the impact of economic conditions on the borrower and managements potential alternative strategies for loan or collateral disposition. An unallocated allowance is established for losses that have not been identified through the formulaic and other specific components of the allowance as described above. Management has identified several factors that impact credit losses that are not considered in either the formula or the specific allowance segments. These factors consist of macro and micro economic conditions, industry and geographic loan concentrations, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, changes in underwriting processes and trends in problem loan and loss recovery rates. The impact of the above is considered in light of managements conclusions as to the overall adequacy of underlying collateral and other factors.\nThe majority of our loan portfolio represents loans made for commercial purposes, while significant amounts of residential property may serve as collateral for such loans. We attempt to evaluate larger loans individually, on the basis of our loan review process, which scrutinizes loans on a selective basis and other available information. Our portfolio of loans made for purposes of financing residential mortgages and consumer loans are evaluated in groups. For PPP loans, the SBA guarantees 100% of the principal and interest owed by the borrower.\nA loan is considered impaired, in accordance with ASC 310, when based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. Impaired loans include nonperforming loans, but also include internally classified accruing loans. As of December 31, 2021, management identified no troubled debt restructurings in the loan portfolio. One troubled debt restructuring in the amount of $4.5 million was identified as of December 31, 2020.\nThe following table presents our impaired loans at December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n(dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31,\nImpaired loans without a valuation allowance\n$ 4,415\n$ 12,842\n$ 12,862\nImpaired loans with a valuation allowance\n14,005\n5,127\n6,020\nTotal impaired loans\n$ 18,420\n$ 17,969\n$ 18,882\nValuation allowance related to impaired loans\n$ 2,743\n$\n$\nTotal nonaccrual loans\n12,541\n12,246\n12,413\nTotal nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans\n0.49 %\n0.46 %\n0.71 %\nAllowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans\n151.22 %\n105.95 %\n74.65 %\nTotal loans past-due ninety days or more and still accruing\n-\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately $15.1 million, $19.6 million, and $18.1 million, respectively. Republic earned $113,000, $478,000, and $386,000 of interest income on impaired loans (internally classified accruing loans) in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. There were no commitments to extend credit to any borrowers with impaired loans as of the end of the periods presented herein.\nTotal impaired loans increased by $451,000, or 3%, during the year ended December 31, 2021. The valuation allowance related to impaired loans increased to $2.7 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $591,000 at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, internally classified accruing loans totaled approximately $6.1 million and $1.8 million, respectively.\nThe following table presents our 30 to 89 days past due loans at December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n(dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31,\n30 to 59 days past due\n$ 4,851\n$ 2,321\n$\n60 to 89 days past due\n4,706\n1,823\nTotal loans 30 to 89 days past due\n$ 9,557\n$ 3,259\n$ 1,935\nManagement has engaged in active discussions with all delinquent relationships to address delinquencies and is confident that acceptable resolutions will be achieved in the near term. Total loans 30 to 89 days past due increased to $9.6 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $3.3 million at December 31, 2020 due primarily to the addition of one loan in the fourth quarter of 2021 totaling $4.1 million. PPP loans 30 to 89 days past due totaled $2.1 million at December 31, 2021.\nDeposits\nDeposits, which include non-interest and interest-bearing demand deposits, money market, savings and time deposits, are Republics major source of funding. Deposits are generally solicited from our market area through the offering of a variety of products to attract and retain customers, with a primary focus on multi-product relationships.\nTotal deposits increased by $1.2 billion to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2021, from $4.0 billion at December 31, 2020. This increase can be attributed to our strategy to expand the reach of our banking model which focuses on enhancing the total customer experience including in-store, on-line and mobile banking options. High levels of customer service and convenience across all delivery channels drives the gathering of low-cost, core deposits. We recognized strong growth in demand deposit balances, including an increase in non-interest bearing demand deposits of 39%, year over year as a result of the successful execution of our strategy. The increase in demand deposits over the last twelve months is also a result of our participation in the PPP loan program. Many of the PPP loans originated were for small businesses that were previously not customers of Republic Bank. Many of these small businesses have chosen to move their primary banking relationship to Republic as a result of the outstanding level of service and cooperation they experienced during the PPP loan process. Commercial deposits were 44% of total deposits as of December 31, 2021.\nTotal deposits by account type at December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 are as follows:\n(dollars in thousands)\nAt December 31,\nDemand deposits, non-interest bearing\n$ 1,404,360\n$ 1,006,876\n$ 661,431\nDemand deposits, interest bearing\n2,283,779\n1,776,995\n1,352,360\nMoney market & savings deposits\n1,305,096\n1,043,519\n761,793\nTime deposits\n197,945\n186,361\n223,579\nTotal deposits\n$ 5,191,180\n$ 4,013,751\n$ 2,999,163\nThe average balances and weighted average rates of Republics interest-bearing deposits for the last three years are as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\nAverage\nBalance\nRate\nAverage\nBalance\nRate\nAverage\nBalance\nRate\nInterest bearing demand deposits\n$ 2,025,420\n0.65 %\n$ 1,509,826\n0.84 %\n$ 1,184,530\n1.32 %\nMoney market & savings deposits\n1,162,032\n0.32 %\n916,607\n0.68 %\n705,445\n0.98 %\nTime deposits\n190,960\n0.79 %\n211,636\n1.82 %\n190,567\n2.02 %\nTotal interest bearing deposits\n$ 3,378,412\n0.54 %\n$ 2,638,069\n0.86 %\n$ 2,080,542\n1.26 %\nTime deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limit, by maturity, as of December 31, 2021 are as follows:\n(dollars in thousands)\nMaturity:\n3 months or less\n$ 9,758\n3 to 6 months\n27,828\n6 to 12 months\n10,342\nOver 12 months\n7,229\nTotal\n$ 55,157\nOther Borrowings\nAs part of the CARES Act, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia offered secured discounted borrowings to banks that originated PPP loans through the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility or PPPLF program. The Company did not pledge any PPP loans or borrow any funds as part of the PPPLF program at December 31, 2021 since the PPPLF program was discontinued on July 30, 2021. At December 31, 2020, we borrowed $633.9 million through the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility provided by the Federal Reserve Bank at a rate of 35 basis points. This borrowing was repaid in full during the first week of January 2021.\nOperating Lease Liability Obligation\nUnder ASC 842, the operating lease liability obligation is calculated as the present value of the lease payments, using the discount rate specified in the lease, or if that is not available, our incremental borrowing rate. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the balance of the operating lease liability obligation was $81.8 million and $77.6 million, respectively.\nShareholders Equity\nTotal shareholders equity increased $16.1 million to $324.2 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $308.1 million at December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to earnings of $21.7 million partially offset by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of $7.8 million associated with a decrease in the market value of the investment securities portfolio. The shift in market value of the securities portfolio was primarily driven by a increase in market interest rates, which decreased the market value of the securities held in our portfolio.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the financial statements.\nCredit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss due to the failure of the other parties to a financial instrument to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. The maximum exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the same underwriting standards and policies in making credit commitments as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments.\nFinancial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk are commitments to extend credit of approximately $549.8 million and $428.9 million and standby letters of credit of approximately $18.0 million and $16.6 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Commitments often expire without being drawn upon. Of the $549.8 million of commitments to extend credit at December 31, 2021, substantially all were variable rate commitments.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and many require the payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customers creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on managements credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include real estate, marketable securities, pledged deposits, equipment and accounts receivable.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued that guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk and collateral policy involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments. The amount of collateral obtained is based on managements credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include real estate, marketable securities, pledged deposits, equipment and accounts receivable.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of December 31, 2021:\n(dollars in thousands)\nTotal\nLess than\nOne Year\nOne to\nThree Years\nThree to\nFive Years\nAfter Five\nYears\nMinimum annual rentals or non-cancellable operating leases\n$ 115,883\n$ 8,134\n$ 15,062\n$ 13,820\n$ 78,867\nBranch construction commitments\n7,606\n7,606\n-\n-\n-\nRemaining contractual maturities of time deposits\n197,945\n166,031\n27,273\n4,641\n-\nSubordinated debt\n11,341\n-\n-\n11,324\nDirector and Officer retirement plan obligations\n1,072\nLoan commitments\n549,765\n228,262\n95,111\n99,330\n127,062\nStandby letters of credit\n17,975\n16,374\n1,545\n-\nTotal\n$ 901,587\n$ 427,171\n$ 139,118\n$ 117,963\n$ 217,335\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had entered into non-cancelable lease agreements for our main office and operations center, twenty current and pending retail branch facilities, five loan offices, one storage facility, and seventeen equipment leases expiring on various dates through August 31, 2059. The leases are accounted for as operating leases. The minimum rental payments required under these leases are $115.9 million through the year 2059.\nWe have retirement plan agreements with certain directors and officers. At December 31, 2021, the accrued benefits under the plan were approximately $1.1 million, with a minimum age of 65 established to qualify for the payments.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nWe attempt to manage our assets and liabilities in a manner that optimizes net interest income in a range of interest rate environments. Management uses an interest sensitivity gap (GAP) analysis and simulation models to monitor behavior of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities. A GAP analysis is the difference between interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities. Adjustments to the mix of assets and liabilities are made periodically in an effort to provide steady growth in net interest income.\nManagement presently believes that the effect of any future reduction in interest rates, reflected in lower yielding assets, could be detrimental since we may not have the immediate ability to commensurately decrease rates on interest bearing liabilities, primarily time deposits, other borrowings and certain transaction accounts. An increase in interest rates could have a negative effect due to a possible lag in the re-pricing of core deposits not taken into account in the static GAP analysis. Interest rate risk management involves managing the extent to which interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities are matched. We attempt to optimize net interest income while managing period-to-period fluctuations therein. We typically define interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities as those that re-price within one year or less. Generally, we limit long-term fixed rate assets and liabilities in our efforts to manage interest rate risk.\nA positive GAP occurs when interest-sensitive assets exceed interest-sensitive liabilities re-pricing in the same time periods, and a negative GAP occurs when interest-sensitive liabilities exceed interest-sensitive assets re-pricing in the same time periods. A negative GAP ratio suggests that a financial institution may be better positioned to take advantage of declining interest rates rather than increasing interest rates, and a positive GAP ratio suggests the converse. Static GAP analysis describes interest rate sensitivity at a point in time. However, it alone does not accurately measure the magnitude of changes in net interest income as changes in interest rates do not impact all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously. Interest rate sensitivity analysis also requires assumptions about re-pricing certain categories of assets and liabilities. For purposes of interest rate sensitivity analysis, assets and liabilities are stated at their contractual maturity, estimated likely call date, or earliest re-pricing opportunity. Mortgage-backed securities and amortizing loans are scheduled based on their anticipated cash flow, including prepayments based on historical data and current market trends. Savings, money market and interest-bearing demand accounts do not have a stated maturity or re-pricing term and can be withdrawn or re-priced at any time. Management estimates the re-pricing characteristics of these accounts based upon decay rates and run off projections obtained in a deposit study performed by an independent third party, along with managements estimates of when rates would have to be increased to retain balances in response to competition. Such estimates are necessarily arbitrary and wholly judgmental. As a result of the run off projections, these deposits are not considered to re-price simultaneously and, accordingly, a portion of the deposits are moved into time brackets exceeding one year. However, management may choose not to re-price liabilities proportionally to changes in market interest rates, for competitive or other reasons.\nShortcomings, inherent in a simplified and static GAP analysis, may result in an institution with a negative GAP having interest rate behavior associated with an asset-sensitive balance sheet. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re-pricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Furthermore, re-pricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities may vary substantially within a given time period. In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayments and other cash flows could also deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating GAP in the manner presented in the table below.\nThe following tables present a summary of our GAP analysis at December 31, 2021. Amounts shown in the table include both estimated maturities and instruments scheduled to re-price, including prime-based loans. For purposes of these tables, we have used assumptions based on industry data and historical experience to calculate the expected maturity of loans because, statistically, certain categories of loans are prepaid before their maturity date, even without regard to interest rate fluctuations. Additionally, certain prepayment assumptions were made with regard to investment securities based upon the expected prepayment of the underlying collateral of the mortgage-backed securities.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity Gap\nAs of December 31, 2021\n(dollars in thousands)\n0 - 90\nDays\n91-180\nDays\n181-365\nDays\n1-2\nYears\n2-3\nYears\n3-5\nYears\nMore\nthan 5\nYears\nFinancial\nStatement\nTotal\nFair\nValue\nInterest sensitive assets:\nInvestment securities and other interest-bearing balances\n$ 276,925\n$ 116,927\n$ 169,875\n$ 294,886\n$ 293,449\n$ 461,205\n$ 1,242,319\n$ 2,855,586\n$ 2,831,048\nLoans receivable\n490,543\n109,678\n198,110\n363,088\n327,698\n517,135\n482,149\n2,488,401\n2,475,944\nTotal\n$ 767,468\n$ 226,605\n$ 367,985\n$ 657,974\n$ 621,147\n$ 978,340\n$ 1,724,468\n$ 5,343,987\n$ 5,306,992\nCumulative totals\n$ 767,468\n$ 994,073\n$ 1,362,058\n$ 2,020,032\n$ 2,641,179\n$ 3,619,519\n$ 5,343,987\nInterest sensitive liabilities:\nDemand interest bearing(1)\n$ 2,283,779\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n-\n$ 2,283,779\n$ 2,283,779\nSavings accounts(1)\n529,155\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n529,155\n529,155\nMoney market accounts(1)\n775,941\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n775,941\n775,941\nTime deposits\n31,987\n66,461\n67,582\n24,591\n2,682\n4,642\n-\n197,945\n197,764\nSubordinated debt\n11,278\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n11,278\n8,644\nTotal\n$ 3,632,140\n$ 66,461\n$ 67,582\n$ 24,591\n$ 2,682\n$ 4,642\n-\n$ 3,798,098\n$ 3,795,283\nCumulative totals\n$ 3,632,140\n$ 3,698,601\n$ 3,766,183\n$ 3,790,774\n$ 3,793,456\n$ 3,798,098\n3,798,098\nInterest rate sensitivity GAP\n$ (2,864,672 )\n$ 160,144\n$ 300,403\n$ 633,383\n$ 618,465\n$ 973,698\n1,724,468\nCumulative GAP\n$ (2,864,672 )\n$ (2,704,528 )\n$ (2,404,125 )\n$ (1,770,742 )\n$ (1,152,277 )\n$ (178,579 )\n1,585,889\nInterest sensitive assets/Interest sensitive liabilities\n21.13 %\n26.88 %\n36.17 %\n53.29 %\n69.62 %\n95.30 %\n140,70 %\nCumulative GAP/ Total earning assets\n(53.61 )%\n(50.61 )%\n(44.99 )%\n(33.14 )%\n(21.56 )%\n(3.34% )\n28.93 %\n(1)\nDemand, savings and money market accounts are scheduled to reprice based upon decay rate and run off percentage estimates obtained through a deposit study performed by an independent third party, along with managements estimates of when rates would have to be increased to retain balances in response to competition. Such estimates are necessarily subjective and could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based.\nIn addition to the GAP analysis, we utilize income simulation modeling in measuring our interest rate risk and managing our interest rate sensitivity. Income simulation considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates on forecasted net interest income, but also other factors such as yield curve relationships, the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and general market conditions.\nNet Portfolio Value and Net Interest Income Analysis\nThe income simulation models management used to measure interest rate risk and manage interest rate sensitivity generates estimates of the change in net portfolio value (NPV) and net interest income (NII) over a range of interest rate scenarios. NPV is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The NPV ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the NPV in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The following table sets forth our NPV as of December 31, 2021 and reflects the changes to NPV as a result of immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as indicated (dollars in thousands):\nChange in\nNPV as a % of Portfolio\nInterest Rates\nNet Portfolio Value\nValue of Assets\nin Basis Points\n$\n%\nNPV\nChange\n(Rate Shock)\nAmount\nChange\nChange\nRatio\n(in Basis Points)\n+400\n$ 613,466\n$ (247,864 )\n(28.78 )%\n13.24 %\n(171 )\n+300\n729,994\n(131,336 )\n(15.25 )%\n14.95 %\n(105 )\n+200\n821,199\n(40,131 )\n(4.66 )%\n16.00 %\n(25 )\n+100\n873,457\n12,127\n1.41 %\n16.25 %\nStatic\n861,330\n-\n0.00 %\n15.40 %\n-\n726,337\n(134,993 )\n(15.67 )%\n12.63 %\n(277 )\nIn addition to modeling changes in NPV, we also analyze potential changes to NII for a forecasted twelve-month period under rising and falling interest rate scenarios.

Modeling changes in NPV and NII require the making of certain assumptions, which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the models presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or re-pricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the NPV measurements and net interest income models provide an indication of interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results.\nManagement believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating our estimated net interest income are reasonable. However, the interest rate sensitivity of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based. Periodically, we may and do make significant changes to underlying assumptions, which are subjective. Prepayments on residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities have increased over historical levels in recent years due to the lower interest rate environment, and may result in reductions in margins.\nCapital Resources\nWe have two outstanding issues of trust preferred securities. The subsidiary trusts are not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The purpose of the issuances of these securities was to increase capital. The trust preferred securities qualify as Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes in amounts up to 25% of total Tier 1 capital.\nIn December 2006, Republic Capital Trust II (Trust II) issued $6.0 million of trust preferred securities to investors and $0.2 million of common securities to the Company. Trust II purchased $6.2 million of junior subordinated debentures of the Company due 2037, and the Company used the proceeds to call the securities of Republic Capital Trust I (Trust I). The debentures supporting Trust II have a variable interest rate, adjustable quarterly, at 1.73% over the 3-month LIBOR rate. The Company may call the securities on any interest payment date after five years without a prepayment penalty.\nOn June 28, 2007, Republic Capital Trust III (Trust III) issued $5.0 million of trust preferred securities to investors and $0.2 million common securities to the Company. Trust III purchased $5.2 million of junior subordinated debentures of the Company due 2037, which have a variable interest rate, adjustable quarterly, at 1.55% over the 3-month LIBOR rate. The Company has the ability to call the securities on any interest payment date without a prepayment penalty.\nDeferred issuance costs included in subordinated debt were $63,000 and $70,000 at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Amortization of deferred issuance costs was $7,000, $6,000, and $6,000 in each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nShareholders equity as of December 31, 2021 was $324.2 million compared to $308.1 million as of December 31, 2020. The book value per share of our common stock increased to $4.68 as of December 31, 2021, based upon 58,943,153 shares outstanding, from $4.41 as of December 31, 2020, based upon 58,859,778 shares outstanding at December 31, 2020.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nWe are required to comply with certain risk-based capital adequacy guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. The risk-based capital guidelines assign varying risk weights to the individual assets held by a bank. The guidelines also assign weights to the credit-equivalent amounts of certain off-balance sheet items, such as letters of credit and interest rate and currency swap contracts.\nUnder the capital rules, risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing common equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and total risk-based capital, respectively, by risk-weighted assets. Assets and off-balance sheet credit equivalents are assigned to one of several categories of risk-weights, based primarily on relative risk. Under applicable capital rules, Republic is required to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 6%, a minimum total capital requirement of 8% and a minimum leverage ratio requirement of 4%. Under the rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in an amount greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets.\nThe risk-based capital ratios measure the adequacy of a banks capital against the riskiness of its assets and off-balance sheet activities. Failure to maintain adequate capital is a basis for prompt corrective action or other regulatory enforcement action. In assessing a banks capital adequacy, regulators also consider other factors such as interest rate risk exposure; liquidity, funding and market risks; quality and level or earnings; concentrations of credit, quality of loans and investments; risks of any nontraditional activities; effectiveness of bank policies; and managements overall ability to monitor and control risks.\nManagement believes that the Company and Republic met, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis. In the current year, the FDIC categorized Republic as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. There are no calculations or events since that notification which management believes would have changed Republics category.\nThe Company and Republics ability to maintain the required levels of capital is substantially dependent upon the success of their capital and business plans, the impact of future economic events on Republics loan customers and Republics ability to manage its interest rate risk, growth and other operating expenses.\nThe following table presents the Companys and Republics capital regulatory ratios calculated based on Basel III guidelines at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n(dollars in thousands)\nActual\nMinimum Capital\nAdequacy\nMinimum Capital\nAdequacy with\nCapital Buffer\nTo Be Well\nCapitalized Under\nPrompt Corrective\nAction Provisions\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\nAt December 31, 2021:\nTotal risk based capital\nRepublic\n$ 347,030\n11.43 %\n$ 242,787\n8.00 %\n$ 318,658\n10.50 %\n$ 303,484\n10.00 %\nCompany\n360,175\n11.83 %\n243,591\n8.00 %\n319,713\n10.50 %\n-\n- %\nTier one risk based capital\nRepublic\n328,066\n10.81 %\n182,091\n6.00 %\n257,962\n8.50 %\n242,787\n8.00 %\nCompany\n341,211\n11.21 %\n182,693\n6.00 %\n258,816\n8.50 %\n-\n- %\nCET 1 risk based capital\nRepublic\n328,066\n10.81 %\n136,568\n4.50 %\n212,439\n7.00 %\n197,265\n6.50 %\nCompany\n281,886\n9.26 %\n137,020\n4.50 %\n213,142\n7.00 %\n-\n- %\nTier one leveraged capital\nRepublic\n322,097\n5.85 %\n224,247\n4.00 %\n224,247\n4.00 %\n280,309\n5.00 %\nCompany\n324,242\n6.08 %\n224,656\n4.00 %\n224,656\n4.00 %\n-\n- %\nAt December 31, 2020:\nTotal risk based capital\nRepublic\n$ 298,291\n12.36 %\n$ 193,062\n8.00 %\n$ 253,394\n10.50 %\n$ 241,327\n10.00 %\nCompany\n326,554\n13.50 %\n193,498\n8.00 %\n253,967\n10.50 %\n-\n- %\nTier one risk based capital\nRepublic\n285,316\n11.82 %\n144,796\n6.00 %\n205,128\n8.50 %\n193,062\n8.00 %\nCompany\n313,579\n12.96 %\n145,124\n6.00 %\n205,592\n8.50 %\n-\n- %\nCET 1 risk based capital\nRepublic\n285,316\n11.82 %\n108,597\n4.50 %\n168,929\n7.00 %\n156,863\n6.50 %\nCompany\n254,254\n10.51 %\n108,843\n4.50 %\n169,311\n7.00 %\n-\n- %\nTier one leveraged capital\nRepublic\n287,114\n7.44 %\n153,414\n4.00 %\n153,414\n4.00 %\n191,767\n5.00 %\nCompany\n308,113\n8.17 %\n153,621\n4.00 %\n153,621\n4.00 %\n-\n- %\nLiquidity\nA financial institution must maintain and manage liquidity to ensure it has the ability to meet its financial obligations. These obligations include the payment of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity; the repayment of borrowings as they mature; the payment of lease obligations as they become due; the ability to fund new and existing loans and other funding commitments; and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities. Liquidity needs can be met by either reducing assets or increasing liabilities. Our most liquid assets consist of cash, amounts due from banks and federal funds sold and securities available for sale.\nRegulatory authorities require us to maintain certain liquidity ratios in order for funds to be available to satisfy commitments to borrowers and the demands of depositors. In response to these requirements, we have formed an asset/liability committee (ALCO), comprised of certain members of Republics Board of Directors and senior management to monitor our liquidity position and interest sensitivity. That committees primary objective is to maximize net interest income while configuring Republics interest-sensitive assets and liabilities to manage interest rate risk and provide adequate liquidity for projected needs. The ALCO committee meets quarterly or more frequently if deemed necessary.\nOur target and actual liquidity levels are determined by comparisons of the estimated repayment and marketability of interest-earning assets with projected future outflows of deposits and other liabilities. Our most liquid assets, comprised of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, totaled $118.9 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $775.3 million at December 31, 2020. Loan maturities and repayments are another source of asset liquidity. At December 31, 2021, Republic estimated that more than $115 million of loans would mature or repay in the six-month period ending June 30, 2022. Additionally, a significant portion of our investment securities are available to satisfy liquidity requirements through sales on the open market or by pledging as collateral to access credit facilities. At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding commitments (including unused lines of credit and letters of credit) of $567.8 million. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year totaled $166.0 million at December 31, 2021. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet all current commitments.\nDaily funding requirements have historically been satisfied by generating core deposits and certificates of deposit with competitive rates, buying federal funds or utilizing the credit facilities of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Pittsburgh. We maintain a line of credit with the FHLB of Pittsburgh. Our maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding overnight borrowings. At December 31, 2021, FHLB had issued a letter on Republics behalf, totaling $100.0 million against our available credit. Our maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding overnight borrowings. At December 31, 2020, FHLB had issued a letter on Republics behalf, totaling $150.0 million against our available credit. We also maintain a contingency line of credit of $10.0 million with Atlantic Community Bankers Bank (ACBB) and a Fed Funds line of credit with Zions Bank in the amount of $15.0 million to assist in managing our liquidity position. We had no amounts outstanding against the ACBB line of credit or the Zions Fed Funds line at both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. As part of the CARES Act, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia offered secured discounted borrowing capacity to banks that originated PPP loans through the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility or PPPLF program. The Company did not pledge any PPP loans or borrow any funds as part of the PPPLF program at December 31, 2021 since the PPPLF program was discontinued on July 30, 2021. At December 31, 2020, the Company pledged $633.9 million of PPP loans to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia to borrow $633.9 million of funds at a rate of 0.35%.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe follow the guidance under ASC 810, Consolidation, with regard to variable interest entities. ASC 810 clarifies the application of consolidation principles for certain legal entities in which voting rights are not effective in identifying the investor with the controlling financial interest. An entity is subject to consolidation under ASC 810 if the investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, are unable to direct the entitys activities, or are not exposed to the entitys losses or entitled to its residual returns (variable interest entities). Variable interest entities within the scope of ASC 810 will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of its expected returns, or both.\nWe do not consolidate our subsidiary trusts. ASC 810 precludes consideration of the call option embedded in the preferred securities when determining if we have the right to a majority of the trusts expected residual returns. The non-consolidation results in the investment in the common securities of the trusts to be included in other assets with a corresponding increase in outstanding debt of $341,000. In addition, the income received on our investment in the common securities of the trusts is included in other income.\nEffects of Inflation\nThe majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. Therefore, a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. Management believes that the most significant impact of inflation on financial results is our need and ability to react to changes in interest rates. As discussed previously, management attempts to maintain an essentially balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities over a one-year time horizon in order to protect net interest income from being affected by wide interest rate fluctuations. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk\nSee Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition - Interest Rate Risk Management. Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm begins on page 72:\nCrowe LLP (Firm ID 173) Livingston, NJ\nBDO USA, LLP (Firm ID 243) Philadelphia, PA\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company begin on page 77.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nShareholders and the Board of Directors of Republic First Bancorp, Inc.\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Republic First Bancorp, Inc. (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated October 25, 2022, expressed an adverse opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAllowance for Loan Losses -Qualitative risk factors\nAs more fully described in Note 2 and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates and records an allowance for loan losses, which represents managements estimate of known and inherent losses related to the loan portfolio. The general component of the allowance covers the non-classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for several qualitative risk factors. The qualitative risk factors include current economic conditions, past loss experience, diversification of the loan portfolio, delinquency statistics, results of internal loan reviews and regulatory examinations, borrowers perceived financial and managerial strengths. Each qualitative risk factor is assigned a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on managements best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. The application of the qualitative risk factors to the historical loss rate calculation is subjective.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that auditing the qualitative risk factors is a critical audit matter is the high degree of subjectivity and judgment involved in the assessment of the risk of loss associated with each risk factor. The primary audit procedures to address the critical audit matter included both control and substantive testing related to the qualitative risk factors. Procedures included, among others:\n\u25cf\nTesting the operating effectiveness of the following controls:\no\nManagements review of the appropriateness and adequacy of the qualitative risk factors\no\nManagements approval of the allowance for loan losses for loans collectively evaluated for impairment, including qualitative risk factors\no\nManagements review of the completeness and accuracy of data inputs used to develop the qualitative risk factors\n\u25cf\nSubstantive tests included:\no\nAgreeing the data inputs used to develop the qualitative risk factors to internal or external source documentation, including evaluating the relevance and reliability of source documents\no\nEvaluating the reasonableness of assumptions and judgments used in developing the qualitative risk factors\no\nEvaluating the reasonableness and appropriateness of qualitative risk factors and resulting allowance, including directional consistency\no\nPerforming analytical procedures for the allowance for loan losses for loans collectively evaluated\nTransactions with Affiliates and Related Parties\nAs more fully described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company routinely enters into transactions with affiliates and related parties in the normal course of business for marketing, graphic design, architectural and project management services, as well as public relations services.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that auditing transactions with affiliates and related parties is a critical audit matter is the nature and extent of audit procedures related to the identification of affiliates and related parties, the approval and monitoring of transactions by the audit committee and board of directors and the completeness and accuracy of disclosures of transactions with affiliates and related parties due to the material weakness in internal controls over related party transactions. The primary procedures performed to address the critical audit matter included substantive testing of transactions with affiliates and related parties. Procedures included, among others:\n\u25cf\nSubstantive tests included:\no\nReading the minutes of meetings of the audit committee and board of directors for evidence of monitoring and approval of transactions with affiliates and related parties\no\nObtaining an understanding of the terms and the business purpose of transactions with affiliates and related parties\no\nEvaluating the results from the third-party independent investigation\no\nEvaluating the completeness of the identification of affiliates and related parties\no\nEvaluating the completeness of transactions with affiliates and related parties\no\nTesting the completeness and accuracy of data inputs used in approving, monitoring and reporting such transactions\no\nTesting the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures of transactions with affiliates and related parties\nDisclosure of the expected transition effect from the adoption of ASC Topic 326 on the allowance for credit losses\nAs described in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company disclosed the expected increase to the allowance for loan losses resulting from the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, Financial instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2022. Upon adoption, the impact the Company incurred a $2.2 million after-tax reduction to stockholders equity balance. The standard replaces the existing Allowance for Loan Loss (incurred loss) guidance with a Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model which is based on expected credit losses.\nThe principal considerations for our determination the disclosure of the expected transition effect from the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 on the allowance for credit losses is a critical audit matter is the high degree of subjectivity and judgment involved in auditing the expected transition effect for loans receivable due to the subjective nature of estimating the losses under ASU No. 2016-13 for purposes of the disclosure and the material weakness in internal controls related to the implementation of ASU No. 2016-13. Our audit procedures related to the disclosure requirements over the expected transition effect included the following:\n\u25cf\nSubstantive tests of the disclosure of the expected transition effect included:\no\nEvaluating the reasonableness of the Companys methodology and certain assumptions and inputs, involved in the adoption of the CECL model\no\nTesting the mathematical accuracy of select calculations\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2021.\n/s/ Crowe LLP\nLivingston, New Jersey\nOctober 25, 2022\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nShareholders and the Board of Directors of Republic First Bancorp, Inc.\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Republic First Bancorp, Inc. (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, because of the effects of the material weaknesses discussed in the following paragraph, the Company has not maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management's report:\n\u25cf\nMaterial weakness in the control environment, which resulted in deficiencies in the communication of certain relevant information to the Board of Directors of the Company, including information related to branch expenditures.\n\u25cf\nMaterial weakness in controls over the review, analysis and approval of related party transactions.\n\u25cf\nMaterial weakness in controls over the implementation of FASBs accounting standard, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operation, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flow for the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\") and our report dated October, 25, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion. We considered the material weaknesses identified above in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures applied in our audit of the 2021 financial statements, and this report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting does not affect such report on the financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Crowe LLP\nLivingston, New Jersey\nOctober 25, 2022\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nRepublic First Bancorp, Inc.\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Republic First Bancorp, Inc.

(the Company) is a one-bank holding company organized and incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It is comprised of one wholly-owned subsidiary, Republic First Bank, which does business under the name of Republic Bank (Republic). Republic is a Pennsylvania state-chartered bank that offers a variety of banking services to individuals and businesses throughout the Greater Philadelphia, Southern New Jersey, and New York City markets through its offices and store locations in Philadelphia, Montgomery, Delaware and Bucks Counties in Pennsylvania, Camden, Burlington, Atlantic and Gloucester Counties in New Jersey, and New York County. In 2016, Republic acquired all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of Oak Mortgage Company, LLC (Oak Mortgage) and, as a result, Oak Mortgage became a wholly owned subsidiary of Republic on that date. Oak Mortgage is headquartered in Marlton, New Jersey. In 2018, Oak Mortgage was merged into Republic and restructured as a division of Republic. The Oak Mortgage name is still utilized for marketing and branding purposes. The Company also has two unconsolidated subsidiaries, which are statutory trusts established by the Company in connection with its two separate issuances of trust preferred securities.\nThe Company and Republic encounter vigorous competition for market share in the geographic areas they serve from bank holding companies, national, regional and other community banks, thrift institutions, credit unions and other non-bank financial organizations, such as mutual fund companies, insurance companies and brokerage companies.\nThe Company and Republic are subject to federal and state regulations governing virtually all aspects of their activities, including but not limited to, lines of business, liquidity, investments, the payment of dividends and others. Such regulations and the cost of adherence to such regulations can have a significant impact on earnings and financial condition.\n2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Republic. The Company follows accounting standards set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The FASB sets accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP) that are followed to ensure consistent reporting of financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. All material inter-company transactions have been eliminated. Events occurring subsequent to the date of the balance sheet have been evaluated for potential recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.\nRisks and Uncertainties and Certain Significant Estimates\nThe earnings of the Company depend primarily on the earnings of Republic. The earnings of Republic are heavily dependent upon the level of net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on its interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the interest paid on its interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Accordingly, the Companys results of operations are subject to risks and uncertainties surrounding Republics exposure to changes in the interest rate environment. Prepayments on residential real estate mortgage and other fixed rate loans and mortgage-backed securities vary significantly and may cause significant fluctuations in interest margins.\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and the public health response to contain it resulted in unprecedented economic and financial market conditions. In response to these conditions, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) reduced the federal funds target range by 150 basis points to 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020. The Federal Reserve has taken additional steps to bolster the economy by promoting liquidity in certain securities markets and providing funding sources for small and mid-sized businesses, as well as, state and local governments as they work through the cash flow stresses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe economic downturn that began in the U.S. as a result of the government-mandated business closures and stay-at-home orders significantly impacted the labor market, consumer spending, business investment and profitability. As a result, the President signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) in March 2020 to lessen the impact of COVID-19 on consumers and businesses. Among other measures, the CARES Act authorized funding for the Small Business Administrations (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to provide loans to small businesses to keep employees on their payroll and to make other eligible payments to sustain their operation in the near term. In December 2020, the Economic Aid Act was signed into law, which extended certain provisions of the CARES Act and provides additional support and financial assistance for small businesses, non-profit organizations, and other entities. These actions, along with other stimulus programs, enacted by federal, state and local government agencies provided stability as vaccines continued to become more widely available and governmental restrictions were slowly lifted.\nIn a period of economic contraction, elevated levels of loan losses and lost interest income may occur. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic has a further impact the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as the Company's regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSignificant estimates are made by management in determining the allowance for loan losses and the realization of deferred income tax assets. Consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing these estimates.\nSignificant Group Concentrations of Credit Risk\nMost of the Companys activities are with customers located within the Greater Philadelphia region. Note 3 - Investment Securities discusses the types of investment securities the Company invests in. Note 4 - Loans Receivable discusses the types of lending the Company engages in, as well as loan concentrations. The Company does not have a significant concentration of credit risk with any one customer.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nFor purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with an original maturity of ninety days or less and federal funds sold, maturing in 90 days or less, to be cash and cash equivalents.\nRestrictions on Cash and Due from Banks\nRepublic is required to maintain certain average reserve balances as established by the Federal Reserve Board. Effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced they were reducing the reserve requirement ratio to zero percent across all deposit tiers. This comes as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact much of the way financial institutions both operate and serve their customers. As a result of this rule, there were no reserve balance requirements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nInvestment Securities\nHeld to Maturity - Certain debt securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at their remaining unpaid principal balances, net of unamortized premiums or unaccreted discounts. Premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted using the interest method over the estimated remaining term of the underlying security.\nAvailable for Sale - Debt securities that will be held for indefinite periods of time, including securities that may be sold in response to changes in market interest or prepayment rates, needs for liquidity, and changes in the availability of and in the yield of alternative investments, are classified as available for sale. These assets are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from operations and are reported net of tax as a separate component of other comprehensive income until realized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investment securities are reported in the consolidated statements of operations and determined using the adjusted cost of the specific security sold on the trade date.\nEquity Securities - Equity securities are carried at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of equity securities are reported in other non-interest income.\nInvestment securities are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when market conditions warrant such an evaluation, to determine whether a decline in their value is other-than-temporary. To determine whether a loss in value is other-than-temporary, management utilizes criteria such as the reasons underlying the decline, the magnitude and duration of the decline, the intent to hold the security until maturity and the likelihood of the Company not being required to sell the security prior to an anticipated recovery in the fair value. The term other-than-temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospects for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment. Once a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary, the portion of the decline related to credit impairment is charged to earnings.\nRestricted Stock\nRestricted stock, which represents a required investment in the capital stock of correspondent banks related to available credit facilities, was carried at cost as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. As of those dates, restricted stock consisted of investments in the capital stock of the FHLB of Pittsburgh and Atlantic Community Bankers Bank (ACBB). The required investment in the capital stock of the FHLB is calculated based on outstanding loan balances and open credit facilities with the FHLB. Excess investments are returned to Republic on a quarterly basis.\nAt December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the investment in FHLB stock totaled $3.4 million and $2.9 million, respectively. The increase was due primarily to a higher membership stock requirement by FHLB at December 31, 2021 which resulted in a higher required investment as of that date. At both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, ACBB stock totaled $143,000.\nMortgage Banking Activities and Mortgage Loans Held for Sale\nMortgage loans held for sale are originated and held until sold to permanent investors. Management elected to adopt the fair value option in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, and record loans held for sale at fair value.\nMortgage loans held for sale originated on or subsequent to the election of the fair value option, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The fair value is determined on a recurring basis by utilizing quoted prices from dealers in such securities. Changes in fair value are reflected in mortgage banking income in the statements of operations. Direct loan origination costs are recognized when incurred and are included in non-interest expense in the statements of operations.\nInterest Rate Lock Commitments\nMortgage loan commitments known as interest rate locks that relate to the origination of a mortgage that will be held for sale upon funding are considered derivative instruments under the derivatives and hedging accounting guidance in FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Loan commitments that are classified as derivatives are recognized at fair value on the balance sheet as other assets and other liabilities with changes in their fair values recorded as mortgage banking income and included in non-interest income in the statements of operations. Outstanding interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) are subject to interest rate risk and related price risk during the period from the date of issuance through the date of loan funding, cancellation or expiration. Loan commitments generally range between 30 and 90 days; however, the borrower is not obligated to obtain the loan. Republic is subject to fallout risk related to IRLCs, which is realized if approved borrowers choose not to close on the loans within the terms of the IRLCs. Republic uses best efforts commitments to substantially eliminate these risks. The valuation of the IRLCs issued by Republic includes the value of the servicing released premium. Republic sells loans where the servicing is released, and the servicing released premium is included in the market price. See Note 23 Derivatives and Risk Management Activities for further detail of IRLCs.\nBest Efforts Forward Loan Sale Commitments\nBest efforts forward loan sale commitments are commitments to sell individual mortgage loans at a fixed price to an investor at a future date. Best efforts forward loan sale commitments are accounted for as derivatives and carried at fair value, determined as the amount that would be necessary to settle the derivative financial instrument at the balance sheet date. Gross derivative assets and liabilities are recorded as other assets and other liabilities with changes in fair value during the period recorded as mortgage banking income and included in non-interest income in the statements of operations.\nMandatory Forward Loan Sales Commitments\nMandatory forward loan sales commitments are based on fair values of the underlying mortgage loans and the probability of such commitments being exercised. Mandatory forward loan sale commitments are accounted for as derivatives and carried at fair value, determined as the amount that would be necessary to settle the derivative financial instrument at the balance sheet date. Gross derivative assets and liabilities are recorded as other assets and other liabilities with changes in fair value during the period recorded as mortgage banking income and included in non-interest income in the statements of operations. There were no mandatory forward loan sales in 2021.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the identifiable net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is recognized as an asset and is to be reviewed for impairment annually and between annual tests when events and circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Impairment is a condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.\nThe Company has one reportable segment: Community Banking. The community banking segment primarily encompasses the commercial loan and deposit activities of the Bank, as well as, residential mortgage and consumer loan products in the area surrounding its stores. Oak Mortgage was acquired by the Bank in 2016 and organized as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank. Oak Mortgage was maintained as a separate legal entity through December 31, 2017 in order to preserve certain secondary market contracts and regulatory licensing requirements.\nOn January 1, 2018, Oak Mortgage operations were restructured as a division of Republic and all assets, liabilities, contracts, employees and activity were merged into the Republic. As a result of this restructuring, the Company re-evaluated its reporting unit structure and determined that as of July 31, 2018 there were no longer two reporting units but rather a sole reporting unit in Republic Bank. As of July 31, 2019, the Company elected to perform a Step One Test for goodwill impairment. The fair value of the reporting unit was higher than the book value and, therefore, no Step Two analysis was required. Goodwill totaled $5.0 million as of December 31, 2019.\nAt March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, and September 30, 2020, the Company performed a quantitative analysis to determine if goodwill had been impaired due to the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and the sustained decline in the Companys stock price. At both March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, the quantitative analysis determined goodwill was not impaired. At September 30, 2020, the quantitative analysis determined goodwill was impaired. The Company concluded that all of its goodwill was impaired and recorded a $5.0 million non-cash charge for the amount of the impairment against earnings based on the quantitative analysis. The charge had no impact on tangible capital and a minimal impact on regulatory capital.\nLoans Receivable\nThe loans receivable portfolio is segmented into commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, owner occupied real estate loans, construction and land development loans, consumer and other loans, residential mortgages, and PPP loans. Consumer loans consist of home equity loans and other consumer loans.\nCommercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating historical and projected profitability and cash flows to determine the borrowers ability to repay their obligation as agreed. Commercial and industrial loans are made primarily based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral supporting the loan facility. Accordingly, the repayment of a commercial and industrial loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness of the borrower (and any guarantors), while liquidation of collateral is a secondary and often insufficient source of repayment.\nCommercial real estate and owner occupied real estate loans are subject to the underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans, in addition to those underwriting standards for real estate loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow dependent and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Repayment of these loans is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the principal business conducted on the property securing the loan. In addition, the underwriting considers the amount of the principal advanced relative to the property value. Commercial real estate and owner occupied real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or the economy in general. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate and owner occupied real estate loans based on cash flow estimates, collateral and risk-rating criteria. The Company also utilizes third-party experts to provide environmental and market valuations. Substantial effort is required to underwrite, monitor and evaluate commercial real estate and owner occupied real estate loans.\nConstruction and land development loans are underwritten based upon a financial analysis of the developers and property owners and construction cost estimates, in addition to independent appraisal valuations. These loans will rely on the value associated with the project upon completion. These cost and valuation amounts used are estimates and may be inaccurate. Construction loans generally involve the disbursement of substantial funds over a short period of time with repayment substantially dependent upon the success of the completed project. Sources of repayment of these loans would be permanent financing upon completion or sales of developed property. These loans are closely monitored by onsite inspections and are considered to be of a higher risk than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to general economic conditions, availability of long-term financing, interest rate sensitivity, and governmental regulation of real property.\nConsumer and other loans consist of home equity loans and lines of credit and other loans to individuals originated through the Companys retail network, which are typically secured by personal property or unsecured. Home equity loans and lines of credit often carry additional risk as a result of typically being in a second position or lower in the event collateral is liquidated. Consumer loans have may also have greater credit risk because of the difference in the underlying collateral, if any. The application of various federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans.\nResidential mortgage loans are secured by one to four family dwelling units. This group consists of first mortgages and are originated primarily at loan to value ratios of 80% or less.\nPaycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, created through the Small Business Administration (SBA) and Treasury Department from a provision in the CARES Act, are SBA-guaranteed loans to small business to pay their employees, rent, mortgage interest, and utilities. PPP loans will be forgiven subject to clients providing documentation evidencing their compliant use of funds and otherwise complying with the terms of the program.\nLoans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, reduced by unearned income and an allowance for loan losses. Interest on loans is calculated based upon the principal amounts outstanding. The Company defers and amortizes certain origination and commitment fees, and certain direct loan origination costs over the contractual life of the related loan. This results in an adjustment of the related loans yield.\nThe Company accounts for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts related to loans purchased based upon the effective interest method. If a loan prepays in full before the contractual maturity date, any unamortized premiums, discounts or fees are recognized immediately as an adjustment to interest income.\nLoans are generally classified as non-accrual if they are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest for a period of more than 90 days, unless such loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than 90 days may also be classified as non-accrual if repayment in full of principal and/or interest is in doubt. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time, and there is a sustained period of repayment performance of interest and principal by the borrower, in accordance with the contractual terms. Generally, in the case of non-accrual loans, cash received is applied to reduce the principal outstanding.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents managements estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments would represent managements estimate of losses inherent in its unfunded loan commitments and would be recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, if necessary. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to operations. Loans are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectability of the loan principal is unlikely. Recoveries on loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance.\nThe allowance for loan losses is an amount that represents managements estimate of known and inherent losses related to the loan portfolio and unfunded loan commitments. Because the allowance for loan losses is dependent, to a great extent, on the general economy and other conditions that may be beyond Republics control, the estimate of the allowance for loan losses could differ materially in the near term.\nThe allowance consists of specific, general and unallocated components. The specific component relates to loans that are categorized as impaired. For such loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers non-classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for several qualitative factors. An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect managements estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio. All identified losses are immediately charged off and therefore no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any individual loan or group of loans, and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan losses.\nIn estimating the allowance for loan losses, management considers current economic conditions, past loss experience, diversification of the loan portfolio, delinquency statistics, results of internal loan reviews and regulatory examinations, borrowers perceived financial and managerial strengths, the adequacy of underlying collateral, if collateral dependent, or present value of future cash flows, and other relevant and qualitative risk factors. These qualitative risk factors include:\n1)\nLending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices.\n2)\nNational, regional and local economic and business conditions as well as the condition of various segments.\n3)\nNature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans.\n4)\nExperience, ability and depth of lending management and staff.\n5)\nVolume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans as well as other loan modifications.\n6)\nQuality of the Companys loan review system, and the degree of oversight by the Companys Board of Directors.\n7)\nExistence and effect of any concentration of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations.\n8)\nEffect of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements.\nEach factor is assigned a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on managements best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. Adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions in a narrative accompanying the allowance for loan loss calculation.\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment, include payment status and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, and the borrowers prior payment record. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial and construction loans by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, the loans obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.\nAn allowance for loan losses is established for an impaired loan if its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The estimated fair values of substantially all of the Companys impaired loans are measured based on the estimated fair value of the loans collateral.\nFor commercial, consumer, and residential loans secured by real estate, estimated fair values are determined primarily through third-party appraisals. When a real estate secured loan becomes impaired, a decision is made regarding whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary. This decision is based on various considerations, including the age of the most recent appraisal, the loan-to-value ratio based on the original appraisal and the condition of the property. Appraised values are discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral, which is considered to be the estimated fair value. The discounts also include estimated costs to sell the property.\nFor commercial and industrial loans secured by non-real estate collateral, such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, estimated fair values are determined based on the borrowers financial statements, inventory reports, accounts receivable agings or equipment appraisals or invoices. Indications of value from these sources are generally discounted based on the age of the financial information or the quality of the assets.\nPursuant to the CARES Act, loan modifications made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of i) December 30, 2020 or ii) 60 days after the President declares a termination of the COVID-19 national emergency are not classified as TDRs if the related loans were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. In December 2020, the Economic Aid Act was signed into law which amended certain sections of the CARES Act. This amendment extended the period to suspend the requirements under TDR accounting guidance to the earlier of i) January 1, 2022 or ii) 60 days after the President declares a termination of the national emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The option to defer principal payments only or both principal and interest payments was offered to loan customers that expressed a need to defer loan payments as a result of the financial impact of the COVID pandemic on their business. The ability to defer loan payments was initially limited to 90 days. An extension for an additional 90 days was granted if conditions warranted such an extension based on an evaluation performed by management. Financial institutions are required to maintain records of the volume of loans involved in modifications to which TDR relief is applicable. The Company elected to exclude modifications meeting these requirements from TDR classification.\nLoans whose terms are modified are classified as troubled debt restructurings if the Company grants such borrowers concessions and it is deemed that those borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty. Concessions granted under a troubled debt restructuring generally involve a temporary reduction in interest rate or an extension of a loans stated maturity date. Non-accrual troubled debt restructurings are restored to accrual status if principal and interest payments, under the modified terms, are current for six consecutive months after modification. Loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are designated as impaired.\nThe allowance calculation methodology includes further segregation of loan classes into risk rating categories. The borrowers overall financial condition, repayment sources, guarantors and value of collateral, if appropriate, are evaluated annually for commercial loans or when credit deficiencies arise, such as delinquent loan payments, for commercial and consumer loans. Credit quality risk ratings include regulatory classifications of special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss. Loans classified special mention have potential weaknesses that deserve managements close attention. If uncorrected, the potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects. Loans classified substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They include loans that are inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified substandard with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current conditions and facts, is highly improbable. Loans classified as a loss are considered uncollectible and are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Loans not classified as special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss are rated pass.\nIn addition, federal and state regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Companys allowance for loan losses and may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination, which may not be currently available to management. Based on managements comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio, management believes the current level of the allowance for loan losses is adequate.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nThe Company accounts for the transfers and servicing financial assets in accordance with ASC 860, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities. ASC 860 revises the standards for accounting for the securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral.\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Company, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity.\nA servicing asset related to SBA loans is initially recorded when these loans are sold and the servicing rights are retained. The servicing asset is recorded on the balance sheet and included in other assets. An updated fair value of the servicing asset is obtained from an independent third party on a quarterly basis and any necessary adjustments are included in loan and servicing fees on the statement of operations. The valuation begins with the projection of future cash flows for each asset based on their unique characteristics, our market-based assumptions for prepayment speeds and estimated losses and recoveries. The present value of the future cash flows are then calculated utilizing our market-based discount ratio assumptions. In all cases, the Company models expected payments for every loan for each quarterly period in order to create the most detailed cash flow stream possible.\nThe Company uses various assumptions and estimates in determining the impairment of the SBA servicing asset. These assumptions include prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved and comparable to assumptions used by participants to value and bid serving rights available for sale in the market.\nFor more information on the SBA servicing asset including the sensitivity of the current fair value of the SBA loan servicing rights to adverse changes in key assumptions, see Note 15 - Fair Value Measurements and Fair Values of Financial Instruments.\nOther Loans Held for Sale\nOther loans held for sale consist of the guaranteed portion of SBA loans that the Company intends to sell after origination and are reflected at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. When the sale of the loan occurs, the premium received is combined with the estimated present value of future cash flows on the related servicing asset and recorded as a Gain on the Sale of SBA loans, which is categorized as non-interest income. Subsequent fees collected for servicing of the sold portion of a loan are combined with fair value adjustments to the SBA servicing asset and recorded as a net amount in Loan and Servicing Fees, which is also categorized as non-interest income.\nGuarantees\nThe Company accounts for guarantees in accordance with ASC 815 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. ASC 815 requires a guarantor entity, at the inception of a guarantee covered by the measurement provisions of the interpretation, to record a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The Company has financial and performance letters of credit. Financial letters of credit require the Company to make payment if the customers financial condition deteriorates, as defined in the agreements. Performance letters of credit require the Company to make payments if the customer fails to perform certain non-financial contractual obligations. The maximum potential undiscounted amount of future payments of these letters of credit as of December 31, 2021 was $18.0 million and they expire as follows: $16.4 million in 2022, $1.4 million in 2023, $127,000 in 2024, and $56,000 in 2026. Amounts due under these letters of credit would be reduced by any proceeds that the Company would be able to obtain in liquidating the collateral for the loans, which varies depending on the customer. There was no liability for guarantees under standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment (including land) are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of furniture and equipment is calculated over the estimated useful life of the asset using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes, and accelerated methods for income tax purposes. The estimated useful lives are 40 years for buildings and 3 to 13 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or terms of their respective leases, which range from 1 to 30 years. Repairs and maintenance are charged to current operations as incurred, and renewals and major improvements are capitalized.\nOperating Leases\nThe Company enters into lease agreements to obtain the right to use assets (ROU) for its business operations, substantially all of which are real estate. Lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized when the Company enters into operating leases and represent its obligations and rights to use these assets over the period of the leases and may be re-measured for certain modifications, resolution of certain contingencies involving variable consideration, or its exercise of options (renewal, extension, or termination) under the lease.\nOperating lease liabilities include fixed and in-substance fixed payments for the contractual duration of the lease, adjusted for renewals or terminations which were considered probable of exercise when measured. During 2021, one lease term for real property was extended, for which the extension was considered probable at the time of measurement. The lease payments are discounted using a rate determined when the lease is recognized. As the Company typically does not know the discount rate implicit in the lease, the Company estimates a discount rate that it believes approximates a collateralized borrowing rate for the estimated duration of the lease. The discount rate is updated when re-measurement events occur. The related operating lease ROU assets may differ from operating lease liabilities due to initial direct costs, deferred or prepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\nThe amortization of operating lease ROU assets and the accretion of operating lease liabilities are reported together as fixed lease expense and are included in net occupancy expense within noninterest expense. The fixed lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.\nThe Company has elected to exclude leases with original terms of less than one year from the operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities. The Company has no agreements that qualified as a short-term lease. The related short-term lease expense would be included in net occupancy expense.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned consists of assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure. They are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less the cost to sell. Revenue and expenses from operations and changes in the valuation allowance are included in net expenses from other real estate owned.\nAdvertising Costs\nIt is the Companys policy to expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax accounting guidance results in two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period by applying the provisions of the enacted tax law to the taxable income or excess of deductions over revenues. The Company determines deferred income taxes using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nDeferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of the evidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination. The term more likely than not means a likelihood of more than 50 percent. The terms examined and upon examination also include resolution of the related appeals or litigation processes, if any. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date and is subject to managements judgment.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties on income taxes, if any, as a component of the provision for income taxes.\nStock Based Compensation\nThe Company has a Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the 2005 Plan), under which the Company granted options, restricted stock or stock appreciation rights to the Companys employees, directors, and certain consultants. The 2005 Plan became effective on November 14, 1995, and was amended and approved at the Companys 2005 annual meeting of shareholders. Under the terms of the 2005 Plan, 1.5 million shares of common stock, plus an annual increase equal to the number of shares needed to restore the maximum number of shares that could be available for grant under the 2005 Plan to 1.5 million shares, were available for such grants. As of December 31, 2021, the only grants under the 2005 Plan were option grants. The 2005 Plan provided that the exercise price of each option granted equaled the market price of the Companys stock on the date of the grant. Options granted pursuant to the 2005 Plan vest within one to four years and have a maximum term of 10 years. The 2005 Plan terminated on November 14, 2015 in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the Plan agreement.\nOn April 29, 2014, the Companys shareholders approved the 2014 Republic First Bancorp, Inc. Equity Incentive Plan (the 2014 Plan), under which the Company may grant options, restricted stock, stock units, or stock appreciation rights to the Companys employees, directors, independent contractors, and consultants. Under the terms of the 2014 Plan, 2.6 million shares of common stock, plus an annual adjustment to be no less than 10% of the outstanding shares or such lower number as the Board of Directors may determine, are available for such grants. Compensation cost for all option awards is calculated and recognized over the vesting period of the option awards. If the service conditions are not met, the Company reverses previously recorded compensation expense upon forfeiture. The Companys accounting policy election is to recognize forfeitures as they occur. At December 31, 2021, the maximum number of common shares issuable under the 2014 Plan was 6.5 million shares. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 551,179 stock units were granted under the 2014 Plan with a fair value of $1.8 million.\nOn April 27, 2021, the Companys shareholders approved the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan of Republic First Bancorp, Inc. (the 2021 Plan), under which the Company may grant options, restricted stock, stock units, or stock appreciation rights to the Companys employees, directors, independent contractors, and consultants. Under the terms of the 2021 Plan, the maximum number of shares which may be issued or awarded is 7.5 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2021, no shares have been granted under the 2021 Plan.\nEarnings Per Share\nEarnings per share (EPS) consists of two separate components: basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for each period presented. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus dilutive common stock equivalents (CSEs). CSEs consisted of dilutive stock options granted through the Companys stock option plans and convertible preferred stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and consisted of dilutive stock options granted through the Companys stock options for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The effects of stock options or payment of dividends on the Companys Preferred Stock are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in periods in which the effect would be anti-dilutive. Antidilutive options are those options with weighted average exercise prices in excess of the weighted average market value for the periods presented.\nThe calculation of EPS for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was as follows:\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nNet income (loss) attributable to basic common shareholders\n$ 21,676 $ 4,131 $ (3,500 )\nWeighted average shares outstanding\n58,891 58,853 58,833\nNet income (loss) per share - basic\n$ 0.37 $ 0.07 $ (0.06 )\nPreferred stock dividends\n$ 3,500 $ 923 $ -\nNet income (loss) attributable to diluted common shareholders\n$ 25,176 $ 4,131 $ (3,500 )\nWeighted average shares outstanding (including dilutive CSEs)\n75,952 58,904 58,833\nNet income (loss) per share - diluted\n$ 0.33 $ 0.07 $ (0.06 )\nThe following is a summary of securities that could potentially dilute basic earnings per common share in future periods that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share because to do so would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented.\n(in thousands)\nAnti-dilutive securities\nShare based compensation awards\n5,492 5,848 4,979\nConvertible preferred stock\n- 5,556 -\nTotal anti-dilutive securities\n5,492 11,404 4,979\nComprehensive Income\nThe Company presents as a component of comprehensive income the amounts from transactions and other events, which currently are excluded from the consolidated statements of operations and are recorded directly to shareholders equity. These amounts consist of unrealized holding gains (losses) on available for sale securities and amortization of unrealized holding losses on available-for-sale securities transferred to held-to-maturity.\nTrust Preferred Securities\nThe Company has sponsored two outstanding issues of trust preferred securities. The subsidiary trusts are not consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. The purpose of the issuances of these securities was to increase capital. The trust preferred securities qualify as Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes in amounts up to 25% of total Tier 1 capital. See Note 8 Borrowings for further information regarding the issuances.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company follows the guidance under ASC 810, Consolidation, with regard to variable interest entities. ASC 810 clarifies the application of consolidation principles for certain legal entities in which voting rights are not effective in identifying the investor with the controlling financial interest. An entity is subject to consolidation under ASC 810 if the investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, are unable to direct the entitys activities, or are not exposed to the entitys losses or entitled to its residual returns (\"variable interest entities\"). Variable interest entities within the scope of ASC 810 will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity's expected losses, receives a majority of its expected returns, or both.\nThe Company does not consolidate its subsidiary trusts. ASC 810 precludes consideration of the call option embedded in the preferred securities when determining if the Company has the right to a majority of the trusts expected residual returns. The non-consolidation results in the investment in the common securities of the trusts to be included in other assets with a corresponding increase in outstanding debt of $341,000. In addition, the income received on the Companys investment in the common securities of the trusts is included in other income.\nTreasury Stock\nCommon stock purchased for treasury is recorded at cost.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nASU 2016-13\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, and requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organizations portfolio. In addition, ASU 2016-13 amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The Company was initially required to adopt ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, however the Company was permitted to and elected to defer the adoption of this ASU 2016-13 until January 1, 2022. Upon adoption in the first quarter of 2022, a cumulative effect adjustment for the change in the allowance for credit losses was recognized in retained earnings. The cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings, net of taxes, was comprised of the impact to the allowance for credit losses on outstanding loans and leases and the impact to the liability for off-balance sheet commitments.\nThe Company approved an accounting policy for credit losses in compliance with CECL and established a CECL governance and approval process. The Company contracted with a third-party vendor to assist in the application of ASU 2016-13 and is utilizing various methodologies such as Vintage, Cohort, and Weighted Average Remaining Maturity to estimate the allowance for credit losses. The Company will utilize multiple economic forecasts over a four-quarter reasonable and a supportable forecast period followed by a cliff reversion to historical losses.\nThe Company incurred a $2.2 million after-tax reduction to stockholders equity balance, in connection with the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2022, inclusive of the estimate for off-balance sheet exposures. The Company also completed its final review of the most recent model run including evaluation of model back-testing and sensitivity analysis results, and finalized certain assumptions primarily related to qualitative adjustments. The Company did not incur a material adjustment to the stockholders equity balance as of January 1, 2022, for the adoption of CECL related to HTM securities. Additionally, the Company has evaluated the composition of its AFS securities and determined that the changes in ASU 2016-13 will not have a significant effect on the current portfolio. However, in connection with the Companys efforts to establish a control framework in connection with the adoption of CECL management determined that there was a material weakness related to the failure to maintain effective controls over the quantification and review of the transition adjustment from the incurred loss model to the CECL model for purposes of disclosing such transition in the audited footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. This material weakness resulted in an adjustment to the Companys disclosures related to the adoption of Topic 326. For more information, see Item 9A: Disclosure Controls and Procedures.\nASU 2020-04\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The ASU provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or derecognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. Specifically, the amendments provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. These relate only to those contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The ASU became effective March 12, 2020 and can be adopted anytime during the period of January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance. There is only one relationship that has LIBOR pricing with a maturity date beyond December 31, 2022. The loan documentation for the relationship contains language for an alternative pricing index when LIBOR is no longer available.\nASU 2021-01\nIn January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope. The ASU clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition, including derivative instruments that use an interest rate for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform. The ASU became effective as of March 12, 2020 and can be adopted anytime during the period of January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance. There is only one relationship that has LIBOR pricing with a maturity date beyond December 31, 2022. The loan documentation for the relationship contains language for an alternative pricing index when LIBOR is no longer available.\n3.\nInvestment Securities\nA summary of the amortized cost and market value of securities available for sale, securities held to maturity, and equity securities at December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\nAt December 31, 2021\n(dollars in thousands)\nAmortized\nCost\nGross\nUnrealized\nGains\nGross\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair\nValue\nAvailable for sale\nU.S. Government agencies\n$ 25,671 $ - $ (743 ) $ 24,928\nCollateralized mortgage obligations\n375,570 989 (5,010 ) 371,549\nAgency mortgage-backed securities\n446,740 254 (5,511 ) 441,483\nMunicipal securities\n6,596 344 - 6,940\nCorporate bonds\n232,395 1,480 (3,409 ) 230,466\nInvestment securities available for sale\n$ 1,086,972 $ 3,067 $ (14,673 ) $ 1,075,366\nHeld to maturity\nU.S. Government agencies\n$ 66,438 $ 1,549 $ - $ 67,987\nCollateralized mortgage obligations\n400,424 4,607 (8,803 ) 396,228\nAgency mortgage-backed securities\n1,193,430 2,295 (12,580 ) 1,183,145\nInvestment securities held to maturity\n$ 1,660,292 $ 8,451 $ (21,383 ) $ 1,647,360\nEquity securities (1)\n$ 9,173\n(1)\nEquity securities consist of investments in non-cumulative preferred stock.\nAt December 31, 2020\n(dollars in thousands)\nAmortized\nCost\nGross\nUnrealized\nGains\nGross\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair\nValue\nAvailable for sale\nU.S. Government agencies\n$ 32,312 $ - $ (426 ) $ 31,886\nCollateralized mortgage obligations\n218,232 3,584 (270 ) 221,546\nAgency mortgage-backed securities\n149,325 1,204 (1 ) 150,528\nMunicipal securities\n8,201 24 - 8,225\nCorporate bonds\n119,118 595 (3,390 ) 116,323\nInvestment securities available for sale\n$ 527,188 $ 5,407 $ (4,087 ) $ 528,508\nHeld to maturity\nU.S. Government agencies\n$ 82,093 $ 4,185 $ - $ 86,278\nCollateralized mortgage obligations\n363,363 12,687 (231 ) 375,819\nAgency mortgage-backed securities\n369,480 5,640 (245 ) 374,875\nInvestment securities held to maturity\n$ 814,936 $ 22,512 $ (476 ) $ 836,972\nEquity securities\n$ 9,039\n(1)\nEquity securities consist of investments in non-cumulative preferred stock.\nThe following table presents investment securities by stated maturity at December 31, 2021. Collateralized mortgage obligations and agency mortgage-backed securities have expected maturities that differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to call or prepay and, therefore, these securities are classified separately with no specific maturity date.\nAvailable for Sale\nHeld to Maturity\n(dollars in thousands)\nAmortized\nCost\nFair\nValue\nAmortized\nCost\nFair\nValue\nDue in 1 year or less\n$ 34,335 $ 34,157 $ 4 $ 4\nAfter 1 year to 5 years\n102,194 102,007 66,434 67,983\nAfter 5 years to 10 years\n32,017 32,099 - -\nAfter 10 years\n96,116 94,071 - -\nCollateralized mortgage obligations\n375,570 371,549 400,424 396,228\nAgency mortgage-backed securities\n446,740 441,483 1,193,430 1,183,145\nTotal investment securities\n$ 1,086,972 $ 1,075,366 $ 1,660,292 $ 1,647,360\nThe Companys investment securities portfolio consists primarily of debt securities issued by U.S. government agencies, U.S. government-sponsored agencies, state governments, local municipalities, and certain corporate entities. Equity securities consist of investments in non-cumulative preferred stock. At December 31, 2021, fair value gains on the equity securities were immaterial. There were no private label mortgage-backed securities (MBS) or collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO) held in the investment securities portfolio as of December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020. There were also no MBS or CMO securities that were rated Alt-A or sub-prime as of those dates.\nThe fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. Net unrealized gains and losses in the available for sale portfolio are included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. Securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than the amortized cost basis.\nThe Company regularly evaluates investment securities that are in an unrealized loss position in order to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. Factors considered in the evaluation include the current economic climate, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost, the current interest rate environment and the rating of each security. An OTTI loss must be recognized for a debt security in an unrealized loss position if the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. The amount of OTTI loss recognized is equal to the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost basis of the security that is attributed to credit deterioration. Accounting standards require the evaluation of the expected cash flows to be received to determine if a credit loss has occurred. In the event of a credit loss, that amount must be recognized against income in the current period. The portion of the unrealized loss related to other factors, such as liquidity conditions in the market or the current interest rate environment, is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for investment securities classified available for sale. There were no impairment charges (credit losses) recorded during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, investment securities with a fair value of approximately $1.2 billion were pledged as collateral for public deposits and certain other deposits as required by law.\nThe following tables show the fair value and gross unrealized losses associated with the investment portfolio, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nAt December 31, 2021\nLess than 12 months\n12 months or more\nTotal\n(dollars in thousands)\nFair\nValue\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair\nValue\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair\nValue\nUnrealized\nLosses\nU.S. Government agencies\n$ - $ - $ 24,928 $ 743 $ 24,928 $ 743\nCollateralized mortgage obligations\n188,416 2,982 57,708 2,028 246,124 5,010\nAgency mortgage-backed securities\n365,859 4,896 39,928 615 405,787 5,511\nMunicipal securities\n- - - - - -\nCorporate bonds\n154,436 2,281 33,351 1.128 187,787 3,409\nInvestment Securities Available for Sale\n$ 708,711 $ 10,159 $ 155,915 $ 4,514 $ 864,626 $ 14,673\nAt December 31, 2021\nLess than 12 months\n12 months or more\nTotal\n(dollars in thousands)\nFair\nValue\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair\nValue\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair\nValue\nUnrealized\nLosses\nU.S. Government agencies\n$ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ -\nCollateralized mortgage obligations\n183,376 6,719 81,994 2,084 265,370 8,803\nAgency mortgage-backed securities\n899,231 10,815 61,756 1,765 960,987 12,580\nInvestment Securities Held to Maturity\n$ 1,082,607 $ 17,534 $ 143,750 $ 3,849 $ 1,226,357 $ 21,383\nAt December 31, 2020\nLess than 12 months\n12 months or more\nTotal\n(dollars in thousands)\nFair\nValue\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair\nValue\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair\nValue\nUnrealized\nLosses\nU.S. Government agencies\n$ - $ - $ 31,886 $ 426 $ 31,886 $ 426\nCollateralized mortgage obligations\n99,497 270 - - 99,497 270\nAgency mortgage-backed securities\n20,934 1 - - 20,934 1\nMunicipal securities\n- - - - - -\nCorporate bonds\n4,559 39 54,649 3,351 59,208 3,390\nInvestment Securities Available for Sale\n$ 124,990 $ 310 $ 86,535 $ 3,777 $ 211,525 $ 4,087\nAt December 31, 2020\nLess than 12 months\n12 months or more\nTotal\n(dollars in thousands)\nFair\nValue\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair\nValue\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair\nValue\nUnrealized\nLosses\nU.S. Government agencies\n$ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ -\nCollateralized mortgage obligations\n62,603 231 - - 62,603 231\nAgency mortgage-backed securities\n54,537 245 - - 54,537 245\nInvestment Securities Held to Maturity\n$ 117,140 $ 476 $ - $ - $ 117,140 $ 476\nUnrealized losses on securities in the investment portfolio amounted to $36.1 million with a total fair value of $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 compared to unrealized losses of $4.6 million with a total fair value of $328.7 million as of December 31, 2020. The Company believes the unrealized losses presented in the tables above are temporary in nature and primarily related to market interest rates or limited trading activity in particular type of security rather than the underlying credit quality of the issuers. The Company does not believe that these losses are other than temporary and does not currently intend to sell or believe it will be required to sell securities in an unrealized loss position prior to maturity or recovery of the amortized cost bases.\nThe Company held four U.S. Government agency securities, 27 collateralized mortgage obligations and 61 agency mortgage-backed securities that were in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2021. Principal and interest payments of the underlying collateral for each of these securities carry minimal credit risk. Management found no evidence of OTTI on any of these securities and believes the unrealized losses are due to fluctuations in fair values resulting from changes in market interest rates and are considered temporary as of December 31, 2021.\nAll municipal securities held in the investment portfolio are reviewed on least a quarterly basis for impairment. Each bond carries an investment grade rating by either Moodys or Standard & Poors. In addition, the Company periodically conducts its own independent review on each issuer to ensure the financial stability of the municipal entity. The largest geographic concentration was in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and consisted of either general obligation or revenue bonds backed by the taxing power of the issuing municipality. At December 31, 2021, the investment portfolio had no municipal securities that were in an unrealized loss position.\nAt December 31, 2021, the investment portfolio included fifteen corporate bonds that were in an unrealized loss position. Management believes the unrealized losses on these securities were also driven by changes in market interest rates and not a result of credit deterioration. Seven of the fifteen corporate bonds are issued by four of the largest U.S. financial institutions. Each financial institution is well capitalized.\nThere were no proceeds from the sale of securities during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2021. A gain of $2,000 was realized on the call of securities. The tax provision applicable to the gain of $2,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to $1,000.\nProceeds associated with the sale of securities available for sale in 2020 were $125.2 million. Gross gains of $3.0 million and gross losses of $230,000 were realized on these sales. The tax provision applicable to the net gains of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to $700,000. Proceeds associated with the sale of securities available for sale in 2019 were $54.7 million. Gross gains of $1.2 million and gross losses of $67,000 were realized on these sales. The tax provision applicable to the net gains of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to $280,000.\nIn December 2018, twenty-three CMOs and two MBSs with a fair value of $230.1 million that were previously classified as available-for-sale were transferred to the held-to-maturity category. The securities were transferred at fair value. Unrealized losses of $9.4 million associated with the transferred securities will remain in other comprehensive income and be amortized as an adjustment to yield over the remaining life of the securities. At December 31, 2021, the total approximated unrealized loss of $2.7 million remaining to be amortized includes ten securities previously transferred in July 2014.\n4.\nLoans Receivable\nThe following table sets forth the Companys gross loans by major categories as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n(dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nCommercial real estate\n$ 780,311 $ 705,748\nConstruction and land development\n216,008 142,821\nCommercial and industrial\n252,376 200,188\nOwner occupied real estate\n526,570 475,206\nConsumer and other\n83,487 102,368\nResidential mortgage\n536,332 395,174\nPaycheck protection program\n119,039 636,637\nTotal loans receivable\n2,514,123 2,658,142\nDeferred costs (fees)\n(6,758 ) (12,800 )\nAllowance for loan losses\n(18,964 ) (12,975 )\nNet loans receivable\n$ 2,488,401 $ 2,632,367\nThe Company disaggregates its loan portfolio into groups of loans with similar risk characteristics for purposes of estimating the allowance for loan losses. The Companys loan groups include commercial real estate, construction and land development, commercial and industrial, owner occupied real estate, consumer, residential mortgages, and PPP loans. PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the U.S. Government and as such have no allowance associated with them. The loan groups are also considered classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics.\nIncluded in loans are loans due from directors and other related parties of $18.9 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $2.2 million, compared to $16.7 million at December 31, 2020, resulting from $4.2 million in additions and ($2.0) in repayments. The December 31, 2020 disclosure has been updated to include business affiliates of directors resulting in an increase to the previously reported $14.9 million balance of related party loans at December 31, 2020. The Board of Directors approves loans to individual directors and other related parties to conform to our underwriting policies.\n5.\nAllowances for Loan Losses\nThe following tables provide the activity in and ending balances of the allowance for loan losses by loan portfolio class at and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n(dollars in thousands)\nCommercial\nReal Estate\nConstruction\nand Land Development\nCommercial\nand\nIndustrial\nOwner\nOccupied\nReal Estate\nConsumer\nand Other\nResidential Mortgage\nPaycheck\nProtection\nProgram\nUnallocated\nTotal\nYear ended December, 2021\nAllowance for loan losses:\nBeginning balance:\n$ 4,394 $ 948 $ 1,367 $ 2,374 $ 723 $ 3,025 $ - $ 144 $ 12,975\nCharge-offs\n(311 ) - (61 ) - (117 ) - - - (489 )\nRecoveries\n33 - 462 64 169 - - - 728\nProvisions\n1,686 596 1,088 720 (146 ) 1,897 - (91 ) 5,750\nEnding balance\n$ 5,802 $ 1,544 $ 2,856 $ 3,158 $ 629 $ 4,922 $ - $ 53 $ 18,964\nYear ended December, 2020\nAllowance for loan losses:\nBeginning Balance:\n$ 3,043 $ 688 $ 931 $ 2,292 $ 590 $ 1,705 $ - $ 17 $ 9,266\nCharge-offs\n- - (333 ) (48 ) (107 ) (67 ) - - (555 )\nRecoveries\n- 3 48 1 12 - - - 64\nProvisions (credits)\n1,351 257 721 129 228 1,387 - 127 4,200\nEnding balance\n$ 4,394 $ 948 $ 1,367 $ 2,374 $ 723 $ 3,025 $ - $ 144 $ 12,975\nYear ended December, 2019\nAllowance for loan losses:\nBeginning Balance:\n$ 2,462 $ 777 $ 1,754 $ 2,033 $ 577 $ 894 $ - $ 118 $ 8,615\nCharge-offs\n- - (1,356 ) - (126 ) - - - (1,482 )\nRecoveries\n- - 217 2 9 - - - 228\nProvisions (credits)\n581 (89 ) 316 257 130 811 - (101 ) 1,905\nEnding balance\n$ 3,043 $ 688 $ 931 $ 2,292 $ 590 $ 1,705 $ - $ 17 $ 9,266\nThe following tables provide a summary of the allowance for loan losses and balance of loans receivable by loan class and by impairment method as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n(dollars in thousands)\nCommercial\nReal Estate\nConstruction\nand Land Development\nCommercial\nand Industrial\nOwner\nOccupied\nReal Estate\nConsumer\nand Other\nResidential Mortgage\nPaycheck\nProtection\nProgram\nUnallocated\nTotal\nDecember 31, 2021\nAllowance for loan losses:\nIndividually evaluated for impairment\n$ 992 $ - $ 1,169 $ 582 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 2,743\nCollectively evaluated for impairment\n4,810 1,544 1,687 2,576 629 4,922 - 53 16,221\nTotal allowance for loan losses\n$ 5,802 $ 1,544 $ 2,856 $ 3,158 $ 629 $ 4,922 $ - $ 53 $ 18,964\nLoans receivable:\nLoans evaluated individually\n$ 4,493 $ - $ 2,558 $ 9,593 $ 1,075 $ 701 $ - $ - $ 18,420\nLoans evaluated collectively\n775,818 216,008 249,818 516,977 82,412 535,631 119,039 - 2,495,703\nTotal loans receivable\n$ 780,311 $ 216,008 $ 252,376 $ 526,570 $ 83,487 $ 536,332 $ 119,039 $ - $ 2,514,123\n(dollars in thousands)\nCommercial\nReal Estate\nConstruction\nand Land Development\nCommercial\nand Industrial\nOwner\nOccupied\nReal Estate\nConsumer\nand Other\nResidential Mortgage\nPaycheck\nProtection\nProgram\nUnallocated\nTotal\nDecember 31, 2020\nAllowance for loan losses:\nIndividually evaluated for impairment\n$ 418 $ - $ 51 $ 122 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 591\nCollectively evaluated for impairment\n3,976 948 1,316 2,252 723 3,025 - 144 12,384\nTotal allowance for loan losses\n$ 4,394 $ 948 $ 1,367 $ 2,374 $ 723 $ 3,025 $ - $ 144 $ 12,975\nLoans receivable:\nLoans evaluated individually\n$ 9,048 $ 2,963 $ 3,955 $ 1,302 $ 701 $ - $ - $ 17,969\nLoans evaluated collectively\n696,700 142,821 197,225 471,251 101,066 394,473 636,637 - 2,640,173\nTotal loans receivable\n$ 705,748 $ 142,821 $ 200,188 $ 475,206 $ 102,368 $ 395,174 $ 636,637 $ - $ 2,658,142\nA loan is considered impaired, when based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan.

The concessions made in a TDR are those that would not otherwise be considered for a borrower or collateral with similar risk characteristics. A TDR is typically the result of efforts to minimize potential losses that may be incurred during loan workouts, foreclosure, or repossession of collateral at a time when collateral values are declining. Concessions include a reduction in interest rate below current market rates, a material extension of time to the loan term or amortization period, partial forgiveness of the outstanding principal balance, acceptance of interest only payments for a period of time, or a combination of any of these conditions.\nPursuant to the CARES Act, loan modifications made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of (i) December 30, 2020 or (ii) 60 days after the President declared a termination of the COVID-19 national emergency were not classified as TDRs if the related loans were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. In December 2020, the Economic Aid Act was signed into law which amended certain sections of the CARES Act. This amendment extended the period to suspend the requirements under TDR accounting guidance to the earlier of (i) January 1, 2022 or (ii) 60 days after the President declares a termination of the national emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2021, there were no loan customers deferring loan payments, and all customers that were granted deferrals to assist during the height of the COVID pandemic have resumed contractual payments. As of December 31, 2020, there were deferrals to 21 customers with outstanding balances of $16 million, or less than 1% of total loans outstanding. At December 31, 2020, approximately $4 million of the deferral requests were for deferment of principal balances only. The remaining deferrals included requests to defer both principal and interest payments. Deferrals as of December 31, 2020 were comprised of the following categories: 90 day deferrals amounted to eight customers with outstanding balances of $3 million and second deferrals amounted to 13 customers with outstanding balances of $13 million.\nThe following table summarizes information with regard to outstanding troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n(dollars in thousands)\nNumber\nof Loans\nAccrual\nStatus\nNon-\nAccrual\nStatus\nTotal TDRs\nDecember 31, 2021\nCommercial real estate\n- $ - $ - $ -\nConstruction and land development\n- - - -\nCommercial and industrial\n- - - -\nOwner occupied real estate\n- - - -\nConsumer and other\n- - - -\nResidential mortgage\n- - - -\nPaycheck protection program\n- - - -\nTotal\n- $ - $ - $ -\nDecember 31, 2020\nCommercial real estate\n1 $ 4,530 $ - $ 4,530\nConstruction and land development\n- - - -\nCommercial and industrial\n- - - -\nOwner occupied real estate\n- - - -\nConsumer and other\n- - - -\nResidential mortgage\n- - - -\nPaycheck protection program\n- - - -\nTotal\n1 $ 4,530 $ - $ 4,530\nAll TDRs are considered impaired and are therefore individually evaluated for impairment in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses. Some TDRs may not ultimately result in the full collection of principal and interest as restructured and could lead to potential incremental losses. These potential incremental losses would be factored into our estimate of the allowance for loan losses. The level of any subsequent defaults will likely be affected by future economic conditions.\nAfter a loan is determined to be a TDR, we continue to track its performance under the most recent restructured terms. There were no loan modifications made during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 that met the criteria of a TDR. There were no TDRs that subsequently defaulted during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The last remaining TDR on the Companys books was paid off in full by the customer during 2021.\nThere was one residential mortgage in the process of foreclosure as of December 31, 2021 and as of December 31, 2020. There was no other real estate owned relating to residential real estate at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n6.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned consists of properties acquired as a result of foreclosures or deeds in-lieu-of foreclosure. Costs relating to the development or improvement of assets are capitalized, and costs relating to holding the property are charged to expense. As of December 31, 2021, the balance of OREO was comprised of two properties.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of other real estate owned for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n(dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nBeginning Balance, January 1st\n$ 1,188 $ 1,730 $ 6,223\nAdditions\n360 233 1,225\nValuation adjustments\n(722 ) (31 ) (646 )\nDispositions\n(466 ) (744 ) (5,072 )\nEnding Balance\n$ 360 $ 1,188 $ 1,730\n7.\nPremises and Equipment\nA summary of premises and equipment is as follows:\n(dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nLand\n$ 19,767 $ 21,304\nBuildings\n69,973 65,936\nLeasehold improvements\n32,831 31,909\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment\n36,304 33,400\nConstruction in progress\n17,677 11,842\n176,552 164,391\nLess accumulated depreciation\n(49,112 ) (41,221 )\nNet premises and equipment\n$ 127,440 $ 123,170\nDepreciation expense on premises and equipment amounted to approximately $8.4 million, $8.2 million, and $6.5 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The construction in progress balance of $17.7 million mainly represents costs incurred for the selection and development of future store locations. Of this balance, $10.1 million represents land purchased and land deposits for four future store locations. Contractual construction commitments related to future store locations were $7.6 million as of December 31, 2021.\n8.\nBorrowings\nRepublic has a line of credit with FHLB of Pittsburgh with a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no fixed term borrowings against this line of credit. There were no overnight borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, FHLB had issued letters of credit, on Republics behalf, totaling $100.0 million and $150.0 million respectively, against its available credit line, primarily to be used as collateral for public funds deposit balances. There were no fixed term advances outstanding at any month-end during 2021 and 2020. At December 31, 2021, $1.8 billion of loans collateralized the FHLB line of credit. No overnight borrowings were outstanding at any month-end in 2021 and 2020.\nRepublic has a line of credit in the amount of $10.0 million available for the purchase of federal funds through the ACBB. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Republic had no amount outstanding against the line at ACBB. There were no overnight advances on this line at any month end in 2021 and 2020.\nRepublic also has a line of credit with Zions Bank of $15.0 million to assist in managing our liquidity position. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Republic had no amount outstanding against the line at Zions Bank. There were no overnight balances on this line at any month end in 2021 and 2020.\nAs part of the CARES Act, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia offered secured discounted borrowings to banks that originated PPP loans through the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility or PPPLF program. The Company did not pledge any PPP loans or borrow any funds as part of the PPPLF program at December 31, 2021 since the PPPLF program was discontinued on July 30, 2021. The Company pledged $633.9 million of PPP loans to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia to borrow $633.9 million of funds at a rate of 0.35% at December 31, 2020.\nTrust Preferred Securities:\nThe Company has two outstanding issues of trust preferred securities. The subsidiary trusts are not consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. The purpose of the issuances of these securities was to increase capital. The trust preferred securities qualify as Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes in an amount up to 25% of total Tier 1 capital.\nIn December 2006, Republic Capital Trust II (Trust II) issued $6.0 million of trust preferred securities to investors and $0.2 million of common securities to the Company. Trust II purchased $6.2 million of junior subordinated debentures of the Company due 2037, and the Company used the proceeds to call the securities of Republic Capital Trust I (Trust I). The debentures supporting Trust II have a variable interest rate, adjustable quarterly, at 1.73% over the 3-month LIBOR. The Company may call the securities on any interest payment date after five years without a prepayment penalty.\nOn June 28, 2007, Republic Capital Trust III (Trust III) issued $5.0 million of trust preferred securities to investors and $0.2 million of common securities to the Company. Trust III purchased $5.2 million of junior subordinated debentures of the Company due 2037, which have a variable interest rate, adjustable quarterly, at 1.55% over the 3-month LIBOR. The Company has the ability to call the securities on any interest payment date without a prepayment penalty.\nDeferred issuance costs included in subordinated debt were $63,000 and $70,000 at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Amortization of deferred issuance costs was $7,000, $6,000, and $6,000 in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n9.\nDeposits\nThe following is a breakdown, by contractual maturities of the Companys time deposits for the years 2022 through 2026.\n(dollars in thousands)\nThereafter\nTotal\nTime Deposits\n$ 166,031 $ 24,591 $ 2,682 $ 2,637 $ 2,004 $ - $ 197,945\nCertificates of deposit of $250,000 or more totaled $82.9 million and $88.4 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Deposits of related parties totaled $103.9 million and $102.8 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The December 31, 2020 disclosure has been updated to include affiliates of directors resulting in an increase to the previously reported $98 million balance of related party deposits at December 31, 2020. Brokered deposits totaled $1.0 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively. Overdrafts totaled $501,000 and $227,000 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and is included in loans receivable on the balance sheet.\n10.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 consists of the following:\n(dollars in thousands)\nCurrent\nFederal\n$ 5,968 $ 810 $ 394\nState\n2,106 1,490 -\nDeferred\nFederal\n483 417 (1,524 )\nState\n(31 ) (1,327 ) (220 )\nTotal provision (benefit) for income taxes\n$ 8,526 $ 1,390 $ (1,350 )\nThe following table reconciles the difference between the actual tax provision and the amount per the statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0% for the year ended December 31, 2021, 21.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 21.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n(dollars in thousands)\nTax provision computed at federal statutory rate\n$ 7,077 $ 1,353 $ (1,018 )\nState income tax, net of federal benefit\n1,639 360 (260 )\nTax exempt interest\n(419 ) (461 ) (425 )\nOther\n229 138 353\nTotal provision (benefit) for income taxes\n$ 8,526 $ 1,390 $ (1,350 )\nThe significant components of the Companys net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\n(dollars in thousands)\nDeferred tax assets\nAllowance for loan losses\n$ 4,811 $ 3,291\nDeferred compensation\n674 641\nUnrealized losses on securities available for sale\n3,628 960\nDeferred fees on PPP loans\n1,110 3,737\nForeclosed real estate write-downs\n1,147 985\nInterest income on non-accrual loans\n810 706\nStock option expense\n2,263 1,780\nGoodwill\n805 890\nOther\n1,396 1,033\nTotal deferred tax assets\n16,644 14,023\nDeferred tax liabilities\nDeferred loan costs\n1,303 1,818\nPremises and equipment\n1,111 191\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n2,414 2,009\nNet deferred tax asset\n$ 14,230 $ 12,014\nThe Companys net deferred tax asset increased to $14.2 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $12.0 million at December 31, 2020. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were 25 and 22%, respectively.\nThe $14.2 million net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2021 was comprised of $1.1 million attributable to deferred fees on PPP Loans, which are expected to reverse in the coming year, and $13.1 million attributable to several items associated with temporary timing differences, which will reverse at some point in the future to provide a net reduction in tax liabilities. The largest future reversal relates to unrealized losses on the loan portfolio, which totaled $4.8 million as of December 31, 2021. The next largest future reversal relates to unrealized losses on securities which were designated as available for sale, which totaled $3.6 million as of December 31, 2021.\nWe evaluate the carrying amount of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently, if necessary, in accordance with the guidance provided in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (ASC 740), in particular, applying the criteria set forth therein to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within its life cycle, based on the weight of available evidence. If management makes a determination based on the available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods, a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and judgments concerning managements evaluation of both positive and negative evidence.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we carefully weighed both positive and negative evidence currently available. Judgment is required when considering the relative impact of such evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of positive and negative evidence must be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified.\nThe Company is in a four-year cumulative profit position factoring in pre-tax GAAP income and permanent book/tax differences. Growth in interest-earning assets has occurred over the last several years and is expected to continue. The Company has added fourteen store locations in the past five years and since the inception of the growth and expansion strategy in 2014, almost every new store location has met or exceeded expectations. The success of the expansion strategy, combined with the stabilization of interest rates and continued loan growth, are expected to continue to support improvement in profitability. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has no federal NOLs to carry forward, which would have potentially been at risk of expiring in the future.\nConversely, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic to the local and global economy may result in a significant increase in future loan loss provisions and charge-offs. Rising interest rates and a downturn in the economy could significantly decrease the volume of mortgage loan originations.\nBased on the guidance provided in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (ASC 740), the Company believed that the positive evidence considered at December 31, 2021 outweighed the negative evidence and that it was more likely than not that all of the Companys deferred tax assets would be realized within their life cycle. Therefore, a valuation allowance was not required at December 31, 2021.\nThe net deferred tax asset balance was $14.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and $12.0 million as of December 31, 2020. The deferred tax asset will continue to be analyzed on a quarterly basis for changes affecting realizability.\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination. The Company has not identified any uncertain tax position as of December 31, 2021. No interest or penalties have been recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019. The Internal Revenue Service has completed its audits of the Companys federal tax returns for all tax years through December 31, 2017. The Pennsylvania Department of Revenue is not currently conducting any income tax audits. The Companys federal income tax returns filed subsequent to 2018 remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.\n11.\nFinancial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the financial statements.\nCredit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss due to the failure of the other parties to a financial instrument to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. The maximum exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. The Company uses the same underwriting standards and policies in making credit commitments as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.\nFinancial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk are commitments to extend credit of approximately $549.8 million and $428.9 million and standby letters of credit of approximately $18.0 million and $16.6 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Commitments often expire without being drawn upon. Of the $549.8 million of commitments to extend credit at December 31, 2021, substantially all were variable rate commitments.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and many require the payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customers creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on managements credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include real estate, marketable securities, pledged deposits, equipment and accounts receivable.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued that guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk and collateral policy involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments. The amount of collateral obtained is based on managements credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include real estate, marketable securities, pledged deposits, equipment and accounts receivable. Management believes that the proceeds obtained through a liquidation of such collateral would be sufficient to cover the maximum potential amount of future payments required under the corresponding guarantees. The current amount of liability as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 for guarantees under standby letters of credit issued is not material.\n12.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company and Republic are from time to time a party (plaintiff or defendant) to lawsuits that are in the normal course of business. While any litigation involves an element of uncertainty, management is of the opinion that the liability of the Company and Republic, if any, resulting from such actions will not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company and Republic, except as noted below.\nOn March 8, 2022, George E. Norcross, III, Gregory B. Braca, and Philip Norcross filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Commerce Program) against the Company and Company directors Vernon W. Hill II, Theodore J. Flocco, Jr., Brian Tierney, and Barry Spevak. The complaint seeks, among other things, declaratory and injunctive relief enjoining the Company and the individual defendants from implementing any amendments to the Companys executive employment agreements until after the Companys 2022 annual meeting of shareholders or taking any other actions outside the ordinary course of business, including executing or extending any related party agreements or any agreements obligating the incurrence of expenses related to the opening of new branches and the renovation of existing branches, without the affirmative vote of a majority of independent directors.\nOn March 29, 2022, George E. Norcross, III filed suit in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas to compel the Company to make available for inspection the books and records as is required under Pennsylvania law.\nAs of the date of this filing, Mr. Norcross has filed papers with the Court dismissing the actions without prejudice.\nOn September 19, 2022, a complaint was filed in the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania against the Company and its current Interim Chief Executive Officer and director and two other current directors. The plaintiffs, the former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and a former director of the Company, allege defamation, defamation per se and false light against the three individual defendants and a breach of the plaintiffs employment agreement by the Company. The complaint seeks certain reimbursement payments and compensatory and punitive damages. The matter is in its early stages and, accordingly, the Company is still assessing the potential outcomes and materiality of the matter. The Company plans to defend itself vigorously in this matter.\nAs a result of shareholder activism and related lawsuits, an independent investigation commissioned by the Companys audit committee and other ongoing legal matters the Company has incurred a significant amount of legal expenses, including reimbursement requests from current and former indemnified directors in accordance with the Companys Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, during 2022 which will impact earnings during this year. The amount of legal fees incurred during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 related to these matters was approximately $10.3 million.\n13.\nRegulatory Capital\nDividend payments by Republic to the Company are subject to the Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965 (the Banking Code) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the FDIA). Under the Banking Code, no dividends may be paid except from accumulated net earnings (generally, undivided profits) without regulatory approval. Under the FDIA, an insured bank may pay no dividends if the bank is in arrears in the payment of any insurance assessment due to the FDIC. Under current banking laws, Republic would be limited to $83.5 million of dividends plus an additional amount equal to its net profit for 2022, up to the date of any such dividend declaration. However, dividends would be further limited in order to maintain capital ratios.\nState and Federal regulatory authorities have adopted standards for the maintenance of adequate levels of capital by Republic. Federal banking agencies impose four minimum capital requirements on the Companys risk-based capital ratios based on total capital, Tier 1 capital, CET 1 capital, and a leverage capital ratio. The risk-based capital ratios measure the adequacy of a banks capital against the riskiness of its assets and off-balance sheet activities. Failure to maintain adequate capital is a basis for prompt corrective action or other regulatory enforcement action. In assessing a banks capital adequacy, regulators also consider other factors such as interest rate risk exposure; liquidity, funding and market risks; quality and level or earnings; concentrations of credit; quality of loans and investments; risks of any nontraditional activities; effectiveness of bank policies; and managements overall ability to monitor and control risks.\nThe following table presents the Companys and Republics capital regulatory ratios calculated based on Basel III guidelines at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n(dollars in thousands)\nActual\nMinimum Capital\nAdequacy\nMinimum Capital\nAdequacy with\nCapital Buffer\nTo Be Well\nCapitalized Under\nPrompt Corrective\nAction Provisions\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\nAt December 31, 2021:\nTotal risk based capital\nRepublic\n$ 347,030 11.43 %\n$ 242,787 8.00 %\n$ 318,658 10.50 %\n$ 303,484 10.00 %\nCompany\n360,175 11.83 %\n243,591 8.00 %\n319,713 10.50 %\n- - %\nTier one risk based capital\nRepublic\n328,066 10.81 %\n182,091 6.00 %\n257,962 8.50 %\n242,787 8.00 %\nCompany\n341,211 11.21 %\n182,693 6.00 %\n258,816 8.50 %\n- - %\nCET 1 risk based capital\nRepublic\n328,066 10.81 %\n136,568 4.50 %\n212,439 7.00 %\n197,265 6.50 %\nCompany\n281,886 9.26 %\n137,020 4.50 %\n213,142 7.00 %\n- - %\nTier one leveraged capital\nRepublic\n322,097 5.85 %\n224,247 4.00 %\n224,247 4.00 %\n280,309 5.00 %\nCompany\n324,242 6.08 %\n224,656 4.00 %\n224,656 4.00 %\n- - %\nAt December 31, 2020:\nTotal risk based capital\nRepublic\n$ 298,291 12.36 %\n$ 193,062 8.00 %\n$ 253,394 10.50 %\n$ 241,327 10.00 %\nCompany\n326,554 13.50 %\n193,498 8.00 %\n253,967 10.50 %\n- - %\nTier one risk based capital\nRepublic\n285,316 11.82 %\n144,796 6.00 %\n205,128 8.50 %\n193,062 8.00 %\nCompany\n313,579 12.96 %\n145,124 6.00 %\n205,592 8.50 %\n- - %\nCET 1 risk based capital\nRepublic\n285,316 11.82 %\n108,597 4.50 %\n168,929 7.00 %\n156,863 6.50 %\nCompany\n254,254 10.51 %\n108,843 4.50 %\n169,311 7.00 %\n- - %\nTier one leveraged capital\nRepublic\n287,114 7.44 %\n153,414 4.00 %\n153,414 4.00 %\n191,767 5.00 %\nCompany\n308,113 8.17 %\n153,621 4.00 %\n153,621 4.00 %\n- - %\nManagement believes that Republic met, as of December 31, 2021, all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the FDIC categorized Republic as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. There are no calculations or events since that notification that management believes have changed Republics category.\nUnder the capital rules, risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing common equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and total risk-based capital, respectively, by risk-weighted assets. Assets and off-balance sheet credit equivalents are assigned to one of several categories of risk-weights, based primarily on relative risk. Under applicable capital rules, Republic is required to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 6%, a minimum total capital requirement of 8% and a minimum leverage ratio requirement of 4%. Under the rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in an amount greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets.\n14.\nBenefit Plans\nDefined Contribution Plan\nThe Company has a defined contribution plan pursuant to the provision of 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan covers all full-time employees who meet age and service requirements. The plan provides for elective employee contributions with a matching contribution from the Company limited to 4% of total salary. The total expense charged to Republic, which is included in salaries and employee benefits relating to the plan, was $1.4 million in 2021, $1.5 million in 2020, and $1.2 million in 2019.\nDirectors and Officers Plans\nThe Company has agreements that provide for an annuity payment upon the retirement or death of certain directors and officers, ranging from $15,000 to $25,000 per year for ten years. The agreements were modified for most participants in 2001 to establish a minimum age of 65 to qualify for the payments. All participants are fully vested. The accrued benefits under the plan amounted to $1.1 million at both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, which is included in other liabilities. The expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 totaled $25,000, $6,000, and $16,000, respectively, which is included in salaries and employee benefits. The Company funded the plan through the purchase of certain life insurance contracts. The aggregate cash surrender value of these contracts (owned by the Company) was $1.7 million at December 31, 2021 and $2.6 million at December 31, 2020 and is included in other assets.\nThe Company maintains a deferred compensation plan for the benefit of certain officers and directors. The plan permitted certain participants to make elective contributions to their accounts, subject to applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, the Company made discretionary contributions to participant accounts. Company contributions were subject to vesting, and generally vested three years after the end of the plan year to which the contribution applied, subject to acceleration of vesting upon certain changes in control (as defined in the plan) and to forfeiture upon termination for cause (as defined in the plan). No future contributions are permitted. Participant accounts are adjusted to reflect distributions, and income, gains, losses, and expenses as if the accounts had been invested in permitted investments selected by the participants, including the Companys common stock. The plan provides for distributions upon retirement and, subject to applicable limitations under the Internal Revenue Code, limited hardship withdrawals.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $1.6 million and $1.4 million in benefits, respectively, had vested and the accrued benefits are included in other liabilities. A reduction in expense of $13,000 and $10,000 was recognized for the deferred compensation plan during 2021 and 2020. Expense recognized for the deferred compensation plan for 2019 was $2,000 and is included in salaries and employee benefits. Although the plan is an unfunded plan, and does not require the Company to segregate any assets, the Company has purchased shares of Company common stock in anticipation of its obligation to pay benefits under the plan. Such shares are classified in the financial statements as stock held by deferred compensation plan. No purchases were made in 2021, 2020, and 2019. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 25,437 shares of Company common stock were classified as stock held by deferred compensation plan.\n15.\nFair Value Measurements and Fair Values of Financial Instruments\nManagement uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of the Companys financial instruments; however, there are inherent weaknesses in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could have realized in a sales transaction on the dates indicated. The estimated fair value amounts have been measured as of their respective year-ends and have not been re-evaluated or updated for purposes of these financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each year-end.\nThe Company follows the guidance issued under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and identifies required disclosures on fair value measurements.\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methods used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are as follows:\nLevel 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e. supported with little or no market activity).\nAn asset or liabilitys level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nFor financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy used at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were as follows:\n(dollars in thousands)\nTotal\n(Level 1)\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets for\nIdentical Assets\n(Level 2)\nSignificant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\n(Level 3)\nSignificant\nUnobservable\nInputs\nDecember 31, 2021\nAssets:\nU.S. Government agencies\n$ 24,928 $ - $ 24,928 $ -\nCollateralized mortgage obligations\n371,549 - 371,549 -\nAgency mortgage-backed securities\n441,483 - 441,483 -\nMunicipal securities\n6,940 - 6,940 -\nCorporate bonds\n230,466 - 227,841 2,625\nInvestment securities available for sale\n$ 1,075,366 $ 1,072,741 $ 2,625\nEquity securities\n9,173 9,173 - -\nMortgage Loans Held for Sale\n$ 8,538 $ - $ 8,538 $ -\nSBA Servicing Assets\n4,705 - - 4,705\nInterest Rate Lock Commitments\n378 - 378 -\nBest Efforts Forward Loan Sales Commitments\n5 - 5 -\nMandatory Forward Loan Sales Commitments\n5 - 5 -\nLiabilities:\nInterest Rate Lock Commitments\n- - - -\nBest Efforts Forward Loan Sales Commitments\n96 - 96 -\nMandatory Forward Loan Sales Commitments\n44 - 44 -\nDecember 31, 2020\nAssets:\nU.S. Government agencies\n$ 31,886 $ - $ 31,886 $ -\nCollateralized mortgage obligations\n221,546 - 221,546 -\nAgency mortgage-backed securities\n150,528 - 150,528 -\nMunicipal securities\n8,225 - 8,225 -\nCorporate bonds\n116,323 - 113,692 2,631\nInvestment securities available for sale\n$ 528,508 $ 525,877 $ 2,631\nEquity Securities\n9,039 9,039 - -\nMortgage Loans Held for Sale\n$ 50,387 $ - $ 50,387 $ -\nSBA Servicing Assets\n4,626 - - 4,626\nInterest Rate Lock Commitments\n1,580 - 1,580 -\nBest Efforts Forward Loan Sales Commitments\n2 - 2 -\nMandatory Forward Loan Sales Commitments\n- - - -\nLiabilities:\nInterest Rate Lock Commitments\n- - - -\nBest Efforts Forward Loan Sales Commitments\n612 - 612 -\nMandatory Forward Loan Sales Commitments\n800 - 800 -\nThe following table presents an analysis of the activity in the SBA servicing assets for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n(dollars in thousands)\nBeginning balance, January 1st\n$ 4,626 $ 4,447 $ 4,785\nAdditions\n733 537 1,026\nFair value adjustments\n(654 ) (358 ) (1,364 )\nEnding balance, December 31st\n$ 4,705 $ 4,626 $ 4,447\nFair value adjustments are recorded as loan and servicing fees on the statement of operations.

These values are adjusted for estimated costs to sell which are incremental direct costs to transact a sale such as broker commissions, legal fees, closing costs and title transfer fees. The costs must be considered essential to the sale and would not have been incurred if the decision to sell had not been made. The costs to sell are based on costs associated with the Companys actual sales of other real estate owned which are assessed annually.\nFair Value Assumptions\nThe following information should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only provided for a limited portion of the Companys assets and liabilities. Due to a wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Companys disclosures and those of other companies may not be meaningful. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Companys financial instruments at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020:\nInvestment Securities\nThe fair value of investment securities available for sale (carried at fair value) and held to maturity (carried at amortized cost) are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1), or matrix pricing (Level 2), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value investment securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted prices. For certain securities, which are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence (Level 3). In the absence of such evidence, managements best estimate is used. Managements best estimate consists of both internal and external support on certain Level 3 investments. Internal cash flow models using a present value formula that includes assumptions market participants would use along with indicative exit pricing obtained from broker/dealers (where available) were used to support fair values of certain Level 3 investments. The fair value of equity securities (carried at fair value) is determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1).\nThe types of instruments valued based on matrix pricing in active markets include all of the Companys U.S. government and agency securities, corporate bonds, and municipal obligations held in the investment securities portfolio. Such instruments are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. As required by ASC 820-10, the Company does not adjust the matrix pricing for such instruments.\nLevel 3 is for positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, and may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, with such adjustment generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, managements best estimate is used. Subsequent to inception, management only changes Level 3 inputs and assumptions when corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar instruments, completed or pending third-party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities, subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure, offerings in the equity or debt markets, and changes in financial ratios or cash flows. Republic has one Level 3 investment classified as available for sale which is a single corporate bond.\nThe corporate bond included in Level 3 was transferred from Level 2 in 2010 and is not actively traded. Impairment would depend on the repayment ability of the underlying issuer, which is assessed through a detailed quarterly review of the issuers financial statements. The issuer is a well capitalized financial institution as defined by federal banking regulations and has demonstrated the ability to raise additional capital, when necessary, through the public capital markets. The fair value of this corporate bond is estimated by obtaining a price of a comparable floating rate debt instrument through Bloomberg.\nMortgage Loans Held for Sale (Carried at Fair Value)\nThe fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is determined by obtaining prices at which they could be sold in the principal market at the measurement date and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Republic elected to adopt the fair value option for its mortgage loans held for sale portfolio in order to more accurately reflect their economic value. Interest income on loans held for sale, totaled $735,000 and $846,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, are included in interest and fees in the statements of operations.\nThe following table reflects the difference between the carrying amount of mortgage loans held for sale, measured at fair value and the aggregate unpaid principal amount that Republic is contractually entitled to receive at maturity as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):\nCarrying\nAmount\nAggregate Unpaid\nPrincipal Balance\nExcess Carrying\nAmount Over\nAggregate Unpaid\nPrincipal Balance\nDecember 31, 2021\n$ 8,538 $ 8,241 $ 297\nDecember 31, 2020\n$ 50,387 $ 48,109 $ 2,278\nChanges in the excess carrying amount over aggregate unpaid principal balance are recorded in the statement of operations in mortgage banking income. Republic did not have any mortgage loans held for sale recorded at fair value that were 90 or more days past due and on non-accrual at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nInterest Rate Lock Commitments (IRLC)\nThe Company determines the value of IRLCs by comparing the market price to the price locked in with the customer, adding fees or points to be collected at closing, subtracting commissions to be paid at closing, and subtracting estimated remaining loan origination costs to the bank based on the processing status of the loan. The Company also considers pull-through as it determines the fair value of IRLCs. Factors that affect pull-through rates include the origination channel, current mortgage interest rates in the market versus the interest rate incorporated in the IRLC, the purpose of the mortgage (purchase versus financing), the stage of completion of the underlying application and underwriting process, and the time remaining until the IRLC expires. IRLCs are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.\nBest Efforts Forward Loan Sales Commitments\nBest efforts forward loan sales commitments are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Best efforts forward loan sales commitments fix the forward sales price that will be realized upon the sale of mortgage loans into the secondary market. Best efforts forward loan sales commitments are entered into for loans at the time the borrower commitment is made. These best efforts forward loan sales commitments are valued using the committed price to the counterparty against the current market price of the interest rate lock commitment or mortgage loan held for sale.\nMandatory Forward Loan Sales Commitments\nFair values for mandatory forward loan sales commitments are based on fair values of the underlying mortgage loans and the probability of such commitments being exercised. Due to the observable inputs used by Republic, best efforts mandatory loan sales commitments are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.\nImpaired Loans (Carried at Lower of Cost or Fair Value)\nImpaired loans are those that the Company has measured impairment based on the fair value of the loans collateral. Fair value is generally determined based upon independent third party appraisals of the properties, or discounted cash flows based upon the expected proceeds. These assets are included as Level 3 fair values, based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. The fair value consists of the loan balances less any valuation allowance. The valuation allowance amount is calculated as the difference between the recorded investment in a loan and the present value of expected future cash flows or it is calculated based on discounted collateral values if the loans are collateral dependent.\nOther Real Estate Owned (Carried at Lower of Cost or Fair Value)\nThese assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is determined through valuations periodically performed by third-party appraisers, and the real estate is carried at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Any declines in the fair value of the real estate properties below the initial cost basis are recorded through a valuation expense. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, these assets are carried at current fair value and classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nSBA Servicing Asset (Carried at Fair Value)\nThe SBA servicing asset is initially recorded when loans are sold and the servicing rights are retained and recorded on the balance sheet. An updated fair value is obtained from an independent third party on a quarterly basis and adjustments are presented as loan and servicing fees on the statement of operations. The valuation begins with the projection of future cash flows for each asset based on their unique characteristics, the Companys market-based assumptions for prepayment speeds and estimated losses and recoveries. The present value of the future cash flows are then calculated utilizing the Companys market-based discount ratio assumptions. In all cases, the Company models expected payments for every loan for each quarterly period in order to create the most detailed cash flow stream possible.\nThe Company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the impairment of the SBA servicing asset. These assumptions include prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved and comparable to assumptions used by participants to value and bid serving rights available for sale in the market. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the sensitivity of the current fair value of the SBA loan servicing rights to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in key assumptions are included in the accompanying table.\n(dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, 2021\nDecember 31, 2020\nSBA Servicing Asset\nFair Value of SBA Servicing Asset\n$ 4,705 $ 4,626\nComposition of SBA Loans Serviced for Others\nFixed-rate SBA loans\n4 % 2 %\nAdjustable-rate SBA loans\n96 % 98 %\nTotal\n100 % 100 %\nWeighted Average Remaining Term (in years)\n19.6\n20.0\nPrepayment Speed\n13.93 % 13.22 %\nEffect on fair value of a 10% increase\n$ (204 ) $ (170 )\nEffect on fair value of a 20% increase\n(393 ) (329 )\nWeighted Average Discount Rate\n10.00 % 10.00 %\nEffect on fair value of a 10% increase\n$ (148 ) $ (152 )\nEffect on fair value of a 20% increase\n(288 ) (295 )\nThe sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. As indicated, changes in value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in value may not be linear. Also in this table, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the value of the SBA servicing rights is calculated without changing any other assumption. While in reality, changes in one factor may magnify or counteract the effect of the change.\nOff-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments (Disclosed at notional amounts)\nFair values for the Companys off-balance sheet financial instruments (lending commitments and letters of credit) are based on fees currently charged in the market to enter into similar agreements, taking into account, the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties credit standing.\nThe estimated fair values of the Companys financial instruments at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2021\n(dollars in thousands) Carrying\nAmount\nFair\nValue\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets for\nIdentical\nAssets\n(Level 1)\nSignificant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3)\nBalance Sheet Data\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 118,884 $ 118,884 $ 118,884 $ - $ -\nInvestment securities available for sale\n1,075,366 1,075,366 - 1,072,741 2,625\nInvestment securities held to maturity\n1,660,292 1,647,360 - 1,647,360 -\nEquity securities\n9,173 9,173 9,173 - -\nRestricted stock\n3,510 N/A N/A N/A N/A\nLoans held for sale\n13,762 13,762 - 8,538 5,224\nLoans receivable, net\n2,488,401 2,475,944 - - 2,475,944\nSBA servicing assets\n4,705 4,705 - - 4,705\nAccrued interest receivable\n15,073 15,073 - 15,073 -\nInterest rate lock commitments\n378 378 - 378 -\nBest efforts forward loan sales commitments\n5 5 - 5 -\nMandatory forward loan sales commitments\n5 5 - 5 -\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits\nDemand, savings and money market\n$ 4,993,235 $ 4,993,235 $ - $ 4,993,235 $ -\nTime\n197,945 197,764 - 197,764 -\nSubordinated debt\n11,278 8,644 - - 8,644\nAccrued interest payable\n550 550 - 550 -\nInterest rate lock commitments\n- - - - -\nBest efforts forward loan sales commitments\n96 96 - 96 -\nMandatory forward loan sales commitments\n44 44 - 44 -\nOff-Balance Sheet Data\nCommitments to extend credit\n- - - - -\nStandby letters-of-credit\n- - - - -\nThe estimated fair values of the Companys financial instruments at December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2020\n(dollars in thousands)\nCarrying\nAmount\nFair\nValue\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets for\nIdentical\nAssets\n(Level 1)\nSignificant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3)\nBalance Sheet Data\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 775,300 $ 775,300 $ 775,300 $ - $ -\nInvestment securities available for sale\n528,508 528,508 - 525,877 2,631\nInvestment securities held to maturity\n814,936 836,972 - 836,972 -\nEquity securities\n9,039 9,039 9,039 - -\nRestricted stock\n3,039 N/A N/A N/A -\nLoans held for sale\n53,370 53,370 - 50,387 2,983\nLoans receivable, net\n2,632,367 2,618,104 - - 2,618,104\nSBA servicing assets\n4,626 4,626 - - 4,626\nAccrued interest receivable\n16,120 16,120 - 16,120 -\nInterest rate lock commitments\n1,580 1,580 - 1,580 -\nBest efforts forward loan sales commitments\n2 2 - 2 -\nMandatory forward loan sales commitments\n- - - - -\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits\nDemand, savings and money market\n$ 3,827,390 $ 3,827,390 $ - $ 3,827,390 $ -\nTime\n186,361 187,292 - 187,292 -\nSubordinated debt\n11,271 8,026 - - 8,026\nAccrued interest payable\n926 926 - 926 -\nInterest rate lock commitments\n- - - - -\nBest efforts forward loan sales commitments\n612 612 - 612 -\nMandatory forward loan sales commitments\n800 800 - 800 -\nOff-Balance Sheet Data\nCommitments to extend credit\n- - - - -\nStandby letters-of-credit\n- - - - -\n16.\nStock Based Compensation\nThe Company has a Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the 2005 Plan), under which the Company granted options, restricted stock or stock appreciation rights to the Companys employees, directors, and certain consultants. The 2005 Plan became effective on November 14, 1995, and was amended and approved at the Companys 2005 annual meeting of shareholders. Under the terms of the 2005 Plan, 1.5 million shares of common stock, plus an annual increase equal to the number of shares needed to restore the maximum number of shares that could be available for grant under the 2005 Plan to 1.5 million shares, were available for such grants. As of December 31, 2020, the only grants under the 2005 Plan were option grants. The 2005 Plan provided that the exercise price of each option granted equaled the market price of the Companys stock on the date of the grant. Options granted pursuant to the 2005 Plan vest within one to four years and have a maximum term of 10 years. The 2005 Plan terminated on November 14, 2015 in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the Plan agreement.\nOn April 29, 2014, the Companys shareholders approved the 2014 Republic First Bancorp, Inc. Equity Incentive Plan (the 2014 Plan), under which the Company may grant options, restricted stock, stock units, or stock appreciation rights to the Companys employees, directors, independent contractors, and consultants. Under the terms of the 2014 Plan, 2.6 million shares of common stock, plus an annual adjustment to be no less than 10% of the outstanding shares or such lower number as the Board of Directors may determine, are available for such grants. At December 31, 2021, the maximum number of common shares issuable under the 2014 Plan was 6.5 million shares. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 551,179 stock units were granted under the 2014 Plan with a fair value of $1.85 million. During 2021, stock units to purchase the Companys common stock were granted to certain employees and directors. The exercise price for the stock units granted was equal to the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. The stock units issued are subject to a one to four year vesting period and expire after ten years.\nOn April 27, 2021, the Companys shareholders approved the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan of Republic First Bancorp, Inc. (the 2021 Plan), under which the Company may grant options, restricted stock, stock units, or stock appreciation rights to the Companys employees, directors, independent contractors, and consultants. Under the terms of the 2021 Plan, the maximum number of shares which may be issued or awarded is 7.5 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2021, no shares have been granted under the 2021 Plan.\nThe Company utilized the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the estimated fair value of each stock option granted on the date of the grant.

Goodwill was written off as a result of an interim test completed as of September 30, 2020. This was a complete write-off of all goodwill on the balance sheet.\nIn 2016, Republic acquired all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of Oak Mortgage Company, LLC (Oak Mortgage) and, as a result, Oak Mortgage became a wholly owned subsidiary of Republic on that date.

The valuation of the IRLCs issued by Republic includes the value of the servicing released premium. Republic sells loans servicing released, and the servicing released premium is included in the market price.\n24.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following table presents non-interest income, segregated by revenue streams that are in-scope and out-of-scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\nNon-interest income\nIn-scope of Topic 606\nService charges on deposit accounts\n$ 13,953 $ 11,058 $ 7,541\nOther non-interest income\n603 168 214\nNon-interest income (in-scope of Topic 606)\n14,556 11,226 7,755\nNon-interest income (out-of-scope of Topic 606)\n18,189 25,009 15,983\nTotal non-interest income\n$ 32,745 $ 36,235 $ 23,738\nContract Balances\nA contract asset balance occurs when an entity performs a service for a customer before the customer pays consideration (resulting in a contract receivable) or before payment is due (resulting in a contract asset). A contract liability balance is an entitys obligation to transfer a service to a customer for which the entity has already received payment (or payment is due) from the customer. The Companys non-interest revenue streams are largely based on transaction activity, or standard month-end revenue accruals. Consideration is often received immediately or shortly after the Company satisfies its performance obligation and revenue is recognized. The Company does not typically enter into long-term contracts with customers, and therefore, does not experience significant contract balances. As of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company did not have any significant contract balances.\nContract Acquisition Costs\nIn connection with the adoption of Topic 606, an entity is required to capitalize, and subsequently amortize as an expense, certain incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if these costs are expected to be recovered. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those costs that an entity incurs to obtain a contract with a customer that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained (for example, sales commission). The company utilizes the practical expedient which allows entities to immediately expense contract acquisition costs when the assets that would have resulted from capitalizing these costs would have been amortized in one year or less. Upon adoption of Topic 606, the Company did not capitalize any contract acquisition cost.\n25.\nLeases\nWe have operating lease agreements for certain land, buildings, and equipment. In some instances, a lease may contain renewal options to extend the term of the lease. We do not have any short-term leases in the calculation of the right-of-use assets and lease liability obligations. The most significant assumption related to the Companys lease application of ASC 842 was the discount rate assumption. Since most of the lease agreements do not provide an implicit interest rate, the discount rate used in determining the operating lease liability obligation for each individual lease was the assumed incremental borrowing rate for the Company that corresponded with the remaining lease term.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had 44 operating lease agreements, which include operating leases for twenty branch locations, seven offices that are used for general office space, and seventeen operating leases for equipment. Two of the real property operating leases did not include one or more options to extend the lease term. Eight of the operating leases for branch locations are land leases where the Company is responsible for the construction of the building on the property. The 44 operating leases have maturity dates ranging from June 2022 to August 2059 most of which include options for multiple five- and ten-year extensions which the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. No operating leases include variable lease payments that are based on an index or rate, such as the CPI. The weighted average remaining operating lease term for these leases is 19.05 years as of December 31, 2021.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had 42 operating lease agreements, which include operating leases for twenty branch locations, seven offices that are used for general office space, and fifteen operating leases for equipment. Two of the real property operating leases did not include one or more options to extend the lease term. Eight of the operating leases for branch locations are land leases where the Company is responsible for the construction of the building on the property. The forty-two operating leases have maturity dates ranging from August 2021 to August 2059 most of which include options for multiple five- and ten-year extensions which the Company is reasonably certain to exercise.

Item 9: Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone. Item 9A: Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nIn preparing this report, the Companys management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), as of the last day of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Interim Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that, due to the material weakness in the Companys internal control over financial reporting described below, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Notwithstanding the material weakness, management believes, based on its procedures in preparing this report, that the consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Companys management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of the financial statements included in this Annual Report. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and reflect managements judgments and estimates concerning the effects of events and transactions that are accounted for or disclosed.\nManagement is also responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u25cf\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets;\n\u25cf\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting procedures;\n\u25cf\nprovide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n\u25cf\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control system, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.\nManagement assessed the Companys system of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. This assessment was conducted based on the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2021 due to the material weaknesses identified below.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nIn 2022, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company engaged outside legal counsel that had no involvement in the underlying matters, to investigate the Companys financial controls, certain corporate governance matters and related party transactions. After review of legal counsels report, management concluded there were deficiencies in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that represented material weaknesses in the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. The first material weakness stemmed from a failure to maintain an effective control environment, which resulted in deficiencies in the communication of certain relevant information to the Board of Directors of the Company, including information related to branch expenditures. This material weakness did not result in a misstatement of the Companys financial statements or an adjustment to related disclosures.\nThe second material weakness related to the failure to maintain effective controls over related party transactions. Specifically, effective controls were not designed and maintained over the review, analysis and approval of related party transactions. The material weakness specifically manifested in deficiencies in: (1) the timely testing of related party information; (2) the failure of management to properly consider Accounting Standards Codification 850, Related Party Disclosures, in identifying all related parties; and (3) the failure of management to operate in accordance with the Companys internal related party transaction approval process. This material weakness resulted in a misstatement of the Companys related party disclosures.\nIn addition, a third material weakness was identified in connection with the Companys implementation of FASBs accounting standard, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaced the incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses with an expected loss model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model. Specifically, the material weakness related to the failure to maintain effective controls over the quantification and review of the transition adjustment from the incurred loss model to the CECL model for purposes of disclosing such transition in the audited footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. . This material weakness resulted in an adjustment to the Companys disclosures related to the adoption of Topic 326.\nThese material weaknesses could result in misstatements of the aforementioned accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.\nThe 2021 financial statements have been audited by the independent registered public accounting firm of Crowe LLP (Crowe). Crowe has also issued a report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. That report has also been made a part of this Annual Report.\nRemediation\nDuring 2022, Management believes that the deficiencies that contributed to the material weaknesses are in the process of being remediated. The material weaknesses will not be considered fully remediated until the enhanced controls are fully implemented and operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.\nThe following changes are contributing to the ongoing remediation:\n\u25cf\nthe appointment of Harry D. Madonna as Executive Chair of the Board and Interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company;\n\u25cf\nthe re-appointment of a Lead Independent Director of the Company;\n\u25cf\nthe restructuring of the Board of Directors to strengthen its risk and financial reporting oversight functions, including the addition of one new independent director with extensive public company and financial reporting experience;\n\u25cf\nreconstitution of the membership of the committees of the Board of Directors and the appointment of new committee chairs;\n\u25cf\nmore frequent meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees; and\n\u25cf\nthe active encouragement by management, with the assistance of the Chairman and the rest of the Board, of an open and collaborative culture, to set an appropriate tone at the top.\nSpecific controls added or enhanced to mitigate the potential for identified deficiencies from continuing include:\n\u25cf\nthe enhancement of information to be provided by management to the Board of Directors, specifically with regard to any potential branch expansion opportunities;\n\u25cf\nthe enhancement of the Companys policies and procedures for the identification, review and reporting of existing related party transactions and the discontinuation of future transaction with related party transactions; and\n\u25cf\nthe implementation of design controls related to CECL and the Allowance for Credit Losses, which includes hiring an external consultant to assist with the continued refinement and testing of design features and controls.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

RSUs issued to Mr. Madonna represented the equivalent of annual grant of equity awards as set forth in his employment agreement. Vesting provisions are set forth in the Outstanding Equity Awards table below.\nDescription of Employment Agreements\nEmployment Agreement with Mr. Madonna. The Company, the Bank and Mr. Madonna are parties to an amended employment agreement dated as of March 1, 2021 (the 2021 agreement or the agreement), which superseded in its entirety the employment agreement dated March 10, 2017, as previously amended (the prior employment agreement). Mr. Madonna consented to the change in officer position in February 2021 from president and Chief Executive Officer to president and Chairman Emeritus of the Company and agreed that such change would not constitute a Termination Event within the meaning of the prior employment agreement or otherwise violate the terms of the prior employment agreement. The 2021 agreement provides for extensions on each annual anniversary date to continue through the end of the then-current Term, plus an additional one-year period, unless either party provides written notice that such party desires to terminate the agreement prior to the anniversary date of the effective date and each anniversary date thereafter. The Company and the Bank may also terminate Mr. Madonnas employment at any time for specified events of good reason (as defined in the agreement). Mr. Madonna may terminate the 2021 agreement with six months prior notice. Mr. Madonna may also terminate the agreement for specified events of good cause (as defined in the agreement). In February 2022, following the approval of a majority of the members of the Compensation Committee, the Company and the Bank provided written notice to Mr. Madonna of their intention to not renew his employment agreement. As a result of this notice, the agreement was scheduled to terminate in accordance with its terms in February 2023. In August 2022, the Companys Board of Directors appointed Mr. Madonna as Executive Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Bank. In connection with such appointments, the non-renewal notice was rescinded and the 2021 agreement will continue under its existing terms.\nMr. Madonnas annual base salary under the 2021 agreement was initially set at $415,000 effective March 2021. His base salary was increased to $500,000 in March 2022 while he serves as Interim Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Madonna is eligible to receive annual increases in base salary at the sole discretion of the compensation committee of the Company after taking into account criteria determined in advance by the compensation committee, and bonuses based on a percent of annual base salary in the sole discretion of the compensation committee upon achievement of established criteria. Any additional compensation may be granted in the form of equity-based awards to align his interests with those of the Companys shareholders.\nThe 2021 amended employment agreement also provides for the annual issuance of options to Mr. Madonna to purchase not less than 100,000 shares of Common Stock (or an equivalent value in restricted stock or stock units) effective March 1, 2021 and continuing annually thereafter so long as Mr. Madonna remains employed under the terms of the agreement. Option grants will be based on meeting or exceeding criteria established from year to year by the committee charged with the responsibility for making grants under the Companys stock incentive plan. Such options, restricted stock or stock units will vest one year after the date of grant or earlier upon the occurrence of either a Change in Control (as defined in the agreement) or a Termination Event (as defined in the agreement) and will be granted at a per share exercise price equal to fair market value of the stock on the date of grant.\nMr. Madonna will also be entitled to certain other customary perquisites, including use of an automobile and reimbursement of related operating expenses, health and disability insurance available to all employees, and reimbursement for travel, entertainment and club dues and expenses. Under the agreement, the Company and the Bank also agree to reimburse Mr. Madonna for the cost of term life insurance policies providing a death benefit in the amount of $4.0 million. The cost to the Company of such life insurance policies from and after March 1, 2021, will reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the severance payment payable to Mr. Madonna described below.\nMr. Madonnas agreement provides for certain severance and change in control benefits. In the event of termination of Mr. Madonnas employment for any reason, including a merger or sale of the Company or the Bank or transfer of a majority of the stock of the Company or the Bank (any one of which shall be considered a Change in Control) or failure by the Company and the Bank to continue his employment at the termination of the agreement or any subsequent employment agreement, or if Mr. Madonna is not elected a member of the boards of directors of the Company or the Bank or upon agreement that Mr. Madonna is to transition from service as President and Chairman Emeritus to service as a non-employee director of the Company and the Bank (each a Termination Event), Mr. Madonna would be entitled to receive a severance payment in the amount of $1.6 million, and five years of continued health benefits. Mr. Madonna would not be entitled to any severance or other payments in the event that his employment terminates for cause, resignation by him without good cause, or as a result of his death. Subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, all severance payments are to be made in a lump sum within 30 days after the applicable termination event.\nIn the event of a merger or sale or transfer of a majority of the stock of the Company or the Bank while Mr. Madonna remains employed by the Company and the Bank or remains serving as a director (or within one year after Mr. Madonna ceases to provide any services to either the Company or the Bank in any capacity), he will be entitled, in addition to any other compensation payable to him under the agreement, to a transaction bonus in an amount determined by the compensation committees of the Company and the Bank, which amount cannot be less than $1.0 million. The transaction bonus is payable within 30 days following consummation of the transaction giving rise to payment of such bonus.\nThe agreement provides for non-disclosure by Mr. Madonna of any confidential information relating to the business of the Company or the Bank during or after the period of his employment, except in the course of employment related duties. In the event that the amounts and benefits payable under the agreement are such that Mr. Madonna becomes subject to the excise tax provisions of Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, Mr. Madonna will be entitled to receive a tax gross-up payment to reimburse him for the amount of such excise taxes. He will also receive a tax gross-up payment for certain other taxes payable by him with respect to certain perquisites under the agreement.\nEmployment Agreements with Messrs. Logue, Cavallaro and Neilon and Ms. Young. On July 14, 2015, the Bank entered into employment agreements with each of Andrew J. Logue, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Bank; Frank A. Cavallaro, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company and the Bank; Jay M. Neilon, Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer of the Bank; and Tracie A. Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer of the Bank. Each of the employment agreements is for a one-year term commencing on July 1, 2015, with annual renewals thereafter absent notice of non-renewal by either party at least six months prior to an annual renewal date.\nUnder the employment agreements, each executive officer is entitled to receive a specified annual base salary and is eligible to participate in other compensation plans or programs maintained by the Company or the Bank for senior executive officers, including stock compensation, retirement, savings and similar plans. Each executive officer is also able to earn an annual bonus based on criteria established by the compensation committee of the Board.\nIn the event of termination of an executive officers employment, including resignation by the officer for specified events of good reason or a failure to continue an officers employment at termination of the employment agreement, the officer would be entitled to receive a lump-sum payment equal to two times the officers base salary in effect immediately prior to termination (the Severance Payment). If the executives employment is terminated as a result of, or in contemplation of, a change in control of the Company, the executive would be entitled to receive the Severance Payment unless the executive accepts a position after the change of control in the surviving company. No severance is payable in the event of termination of an executives employment for specified events of cause, or as a result of an executives death, disability or resignation without good reason.\nThe employment agreements include customary provisions relating to non-competition and non-solicitation of customers and employees for a period of twelve months following termination of employment. The employment agreements replace and supersede any prior employment or change in control agreements to which any of the executive officers were a party.\nServices and Employment Agreements with Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nIn March 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Vernon W. Hill, II regarding his provision of services to the Company as Chairman of the Board (the services agreement). The initial term of the agreement was a five-year period commencing in March 2017. In addition to his position as Chairman of the Board, Mr. Hill became Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Bank and Chairman of the Board of the Bank in February 2021. Accordingly, the Company and Mr. Hill entered into a new employment agreement (the employment agreement), which replaced the existing services agreement, effective as of March 2021, to reflect the changes in Mr. Hills duties and positions.\nUnder the services agreement, Mr. Hill served as Chairman of the Board, to preside over all meetings of the Board and shareholders, and perform such other functions as required of a public company board chairman and such other duties as the Board may require, which he did through February of 2021. For services under the agreement, Mr. Hill was entitled to receive base compensation of not less than $360,000 per year, and to participate in any bonus programs, incentive compensation plans, stock option plans or similar benefit or compensation plans at any time in effect that are made generally available to directors and executive officers of the Company.\nUnder the employment agreement, Mr. Hill was entitled to receive base compensation of not less than $490,000 per year, and to participate in any bonus programs, incentive compensation plans, stock option plans or similar benefit or compensation plans at any time in effect that are made generally available to directors and executive officers of the Company. The employment agreement was for a two-year term and extended on each annual anniversary date to provide for a two-year term unless either party provided written notice that such party desires to terminate the agreement prior to an annual anniversary date. The Company could terminate Mr. Hills services under the agreement at any time with or without cause (as defined in the agreement). In the event of a termination by the Company for cause, Mr. Hill would be entitled to any prorated portion of his compensation through the termination date and the Company would have no further obligations under the agreement. In the event that the Company terminated Mr. Hills services without cause, the Company would be required to pay Mr. Hill, a lump-sum severance payment equal to three times his base salary plus a continuation of specified benefits for a period of one year. The Company could also terminate the agreement for permanent disability, in which case Mr. Hill would have received a portion of his compensation for the balance of the remaining term of the agreement offset by any disability payments due to Mr. Hill under any company-sponsored disability plan. In the event of death, Mr. Hills estate would have been entitled to a death benefit equal to three times compensation.\nMr. Hill could voluntarily terminate his services under the employment agreement for specified events of good reason occurring within three years after a change in control of the Company. In the event of Mr. Hills voluntary termination for any of such events of good reason following a change in control of the Company, he would have been entitled to a lump-sum severance payment equal to three times his base salary plus a continuation of specified benefits for a period of one year.\nIn July 2022, Mr. Hill provided written notice to the Company of his resignation as Chief Executive Officer effective in August 2022. He disclosed his reasons for his resignation in a letter to the Board dated July 6, 2022, alleging a breach of his existing employment agreement. In August 2022, Mr. Hill provided written notice to the Company of his resignation as a member of the board of directors effective immediately. He disclosed his reasons for his resignation from the Board in a letter dated August 8, 2022, alleging, among other things, deprivation of meaningful representation in the management of the Companys affairs. The Board of Directors disagrees with the allegations by Mr. Hill and has formed a Special Litigation Committee to respond to demands by shareholders of the Company to investigate whether claims should be brought by the Company against Mr. Hill, as well as former directors Barry Spevak and Brian Tierney, based upon allegations of improper conduct they may have taken against the Company or any of its operations.\nOutstanding Equity Awards at 2021 Fiscal Year End\nThe following table sets forth information concerning outstanding equity awards held by the Companys named executive officers as of December 31, 2021.\nOption Awards\nStock Awards\nName\nNumber of\nSecurities\nUnderlying\nUnexercised\nOptions\nExercisable\n(#)\nNumber of\nSecurities\nUnderlying\nUnexercised\nOptions\nUnexercisable\n(#)\nOption\nExercise\nPrice\n($)\nOption\nExpiration\nDate\nNumber of\nShares or\nUnits of Stock\nThat Have\nNot Vested\n(#) (5)\nMarket Value of Shares or\nUnits of Stock That Have\nNot Vested\n($) (6)\nVernon W.

RSUs granted to Mr. Cavallaro, Mr. Logue, Mr. Neilon and Ms. Young vest in four equal annual installments beginning February 18, 2022, the first anniversary date of the grant.\n(6)\nThe market value realized upon vesting was calculated using the closing price of Common Stock ($3.72 per share) on December 31, 2021.\nOption Exercises and Stock Vested in 2021\nThere were no exercises of outstanding stock options or vesting of stock awards for the Companys named executive officers during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nPension Benefits at December 31, 2021\nIn 1992, the Company adopted a supplemental retirement plan for non-employee directors. The plan was frozen to new participants in 1992, but the Company continues to maintain the plan for participants who served as non-employee directors in 1992. At that time, Mr. Madonna was a non-employee director and he continues to be a participant in the plan. The present value of accumulated benefit was calculated based upon the actuarial present value of accumulated benefits, calculated as of December 31, 2021, as described below. The plan provides for a retirement benefit of $25,000 per year for ten years, which payments may begin at the later of actual retirement date or 65 years of age. Mr. Madonna has reached 65 years of age and the amount shown in the table below represents the present value of the accumulated benefit amount necessary to fund $25,000 annual payments over a ten year period commencing December 31, 2021, which was the end of the Companys most recently completed fiscal year. Present value was calculated using a 4% discount rate.\nName\nPlan Name\nNumber of\nYears Credited\nService (#) (1)\nPresent Value\nof Accumulated\nBenefit (1)($)\nPayments\nDuring Last\nFiscal Year\n($)\nHarry D.

Years of credited service reflect the number of years since the plan was adopted.\nNonqualified Deferred Compensation at December 31, 2021\nThe Company maintains a deferred compensation plan for the benefit of certain officers and directors. In 2009, the compensation committee prohibited any additional individuals from participating in the plan. Mr. Madonna is the only named executive officer who is an eligible participant. The plan permits participants to make elective contributions to their accounts, subject to applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, the Company may make discretionary contributions to participant accounts. Company contributions are subject to vesting, and generally vest three years after the end of the plan year to which the contribution applies, subject to acceleration of vesting upon certain changes in control (as defined in the plan) and to forfeiture upon termination for cause (as defined in the plan). Participant accounts are adjusted to reflect contributions and distributions, and income, gains, losses, and expenses as if the accounts had been invested in permitted investments selected by the participants, including Common Stock. The plan provides for distributions upon retirement and, subject to applicable limitations under the Internal Revenue Code, limited hardship withdrawals.\nName\nExecutive\nContributions\nin Last Fiscal\nYear($)\nRegistrant\nContributions\nin Last Fiscal\nYear($)\nAggregate\nEarnings\n(Losses) in Last\nFiscal Year\n($) (1)\nAggregate\nWithdrawals/\nDistributions\nin Last Fiscal\nYear($)\nAggregate\nBalance at\nLast Fiscal\nYear-End ($)\n(2)\nHarry D.

Their deferred compensation accounts are credited with gains, losses and expenses as if they had been invested in the common stock of the Company and shares of certain publicly traded mutual funds as allowed by the plan. The gains credited to their deferred compensation accounts during 2021 are reflected in the Director Compensation table above.\nChief Executive Officer Pay Ratio Disclosure\nThe following pay ratio information is provided in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act.\nFor fiscal 2021, the Companys last completed fiscal year:\nthe median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company (other than the Chief Executive Officer) was $55,192; and\nthe annual total compensation of the Companys Chief Executive Officer, Vernon W. Hill, II, was $618,625.\nBased on this information, the ratio for 2021 of the annual total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is 11 to 1.\nThe following steps were taken to determine the annual total compensation of the median employee and the Chief Executive Officer:\nAs of December 31, 2021, the employee population consisted of approximately 514 individuals, including full time, part time, temporary, and seasonal employees employed on that date. This date was selected because it aligned with calendar year end and allowed identification of employees in a reasonably efficient manner.\nFor purposes of identifying the median employee from our employee population base, wages from our internal payroll records for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021 were used. These wages were consistent with amounts reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 for fiscal 2021. Consistent with the calculation of the Chief Executive Officers annual compensation, other elements of employee compensation were considered and added, if applicable when calculating the annual total compensation for all employees.\nIn addition, the compensation of approximately 60 full time or part time employees who were hired during 2021 and employed on December 31, 2021 was annualized. No full-time equivalent adjustments were made for part time employees, of which there were approximately 20.\nThe median employee was identified using this compensation measure and methodology, which was consistently applied to all employees. The amounts reported in the 2021 Summary Compensation Table for named executive officers was used for the total annual compensation of the Chief Executive Officer. The salary amount reported in this table was annualized to reflect a full years compensation for the purpose of calculating the pay ratio disclosure.

Any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of, common stock; and/or, (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose, or to direct the disposition, of common stock, is determined to be a beneficial owner of the common stock. All shares are subject to the named persons sole voting and investment power unless otherwise indicated. Shares beneficially owned include shares issuable upon exercise of options which are currently exercisable or which will be exercisable within 60 days of October 25, 2022. Shares beneficially owned also include shares issuable upon conversion of convertible securities which are currently convertible or which will be convertible within 60 days of October 25, 2022. Percentage calculations presume that the identified individual or group exercise or convert all of his, her or their respective options and convertible securities, and that no other holders of options exercise their options or convert their convertible securities. As of October 25, 2022, there were 63,787,064 shares of the Common Stock outstanding. Other than those persons listed in the table above, the Company is not aware of any person, as such term is defined in the Exchange Act, that beneficially owns more than 5% of its Common Stock as of October 25, 2022.\n(3)\nMr. Cohens total includes 75,000 shares of Common Stock issuable subject to options which are currently exercisable. Andrew Cohen is the Co-founder and Chief Investment Officer of Cohen Private Ventures, LLC which may be deemed an affiliate of CPV Partners, LLC, which holds shares of Common Stock as described in Footnote 15 below. Andrew Cohen does not have the power to vote on or dispose of such shares and accordingly does not beneficially own those shares.\n(4)\nMs. Jacobs total includes 75,000 shares of Common Stock issuable subject to options which are currently exercisable and 1,000 shares of preferred stock which are currently convertible into 8,333 shares of common stock.\n(5)\nMr. Madonnas total includes 624,000 shares of Common Stock issuable subject to options which are currently exercisable.\n(6)\nMr. Wildsteins total includes 135,000 shares of Common Stock issuable subject to options which are currently exercisable.

The principal business office address is 55 East 52nd Street, New York, NY 10055.\n(12)\nMr. Hills total includes 425,000 shares of Common Stock issuable subject to options which are currently exercisable. Also includes 2,295,666 shares held in multiple trusts of which Mr. Hill serves as a trustee and 500,000 shares held an IRA account controlled by his wife. Mr. Hill owns 50,000 shares of convertible preferred stock issued by the Company which are convertible into 416,667 shares of Common Stock. A restriction on conversion included in the preferred stock instrument prohibits conversion to the extent that such conversion would cause the holder to own or control 10% or more of the Common Stock outstanding. Accordingly, the calculation of the number of shares beneficially owned in the table does not include 23,000 shares of preferred stock which are currently convertible into 191,667 shares of Common Stock. The address of Mr. Hill is 14000 Horizon Way, Suite 100, Mt. Laurel, NJ 08054.\n(13)\nInformation is derived from a Form 13D/A Amendment No. 20 filed with the SEC on September 22, 2022 by George E.

None of such loans are nonaccrual, past due, restructured or potential problems, and all of such loans were made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to the Company or the Bank and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.\nThe Company entered into a services agreement with Vernon W. Hill, II, effective in March 2017, regarding his provision of services to the Company as chairman of the Board. Effective in March 2021, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Hill to reflect his additional position as chief executive officer. The employment agreement replaced in its entirety, the prior services agreement with Mr. Hill that was initially entered into in March 2017. Mr. Hill resigned from the position of Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company and the Bank in August 2022. Mr. Hill is beneficial owner of more than five percent of the outstanding Common Stock.\nAccordingly, Mr. Hill and his wife were considered related persons during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Pursuant to the agreements described above, Mr. Hill received $43,333 during 2021 and $260,000 during 2020 as compensation under his services agreement for his role on the Board. In addition, the Company paid $696,000 and $390,000 during 2021 and 2020, respectively, to InterArch, Inc., a company that is wholly-owned by Mr. Hills wife, for marketing, graphic design, architectural, and project management services. We also paid $177,000 per year during 2021 and 2020 to Glassboro Properties, LLC related to a land lease agreement for our Glassboro store. Mr. Hill has an ownership interest in Glassboro Properties LLC, which is a commercial real estate firm.\nWe paid $120,000 per year during 2021 and 2020, to Brian Communications for public relations services. Brian Tierney, a member of the Board, is the chief executive officer of Brian Communications, a strategic communications agency.\nReview, approval or ratification of transactions with related persons\nAll transactions, including arrangements and relationships, with related persons that are required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K are approved by our Board excluding interested parties. Extensions of credit to insiders, including related persons, are made pursuant to a written policy designed to ensure compliance with Federal Reserve Board Regulation O, the primary federal banking regulation which governs extensions of credit to insiders, and is applicable to the Bank.\nDirector Independence\nThe Board has determined that all of the Companys non-executive board members are independent under NASDAQs corporate governance listing standards, resulting in 75% of the Board being deemed independent of management. In addition, the Board has determined that all members of the audit, nominating and governance, and compensation committees are independent (as defined under the applicable SEC rules and the listing standards of NASDAQ).\nTo be independent, a director must have no disqualifying relationships as defined by the NASDAQ listing rules, and the Board must have affirmatively determined that the director has no other relationship with the Company, either directly or indirectly, that would interfere with his, her or their exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. In determining the directors independence, the Board considered both loan and non-loan transactions between the Bank and the directors, their family members and businesses with whom they are associated.\nApplying the foregoing, the Board has determined that the following directors are independent: Andrew Cohen, Benjamin C. Duster, Lisa Jacobs, Esq., and Harris Wildstein, Esq. The only director determined not to be independent was Harry D. Madonna, Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer. In addition, the Board has designated Harris Wildstein, Esq. as its lead independent director.\nEach independent director has direct access to our chairman of the board and chief executive officer, as well as to our president and other members of the senior management team. The independent directors are also given the option at every board meeting to meet in executive session without management present.

The audit committee also meets with the Companys independent auditors, on a quarterly basis, following completion of their quarterly reviews and annual audit and prior to the Companys earnings announcements, to review the results of the auditors work. During the course of the year, the chairman of the audit committee has the authority to pre-approve requests for services that were not approved in the annual pre-approval process. The chairman reports any interim pre-approvals at the following quarterly meeting. At each of the meetings, management and the Companys independent auditors update the audit committee with material changes to any service engagement and related fee estimates as compared to amounts previously approved. All of the audit and non-audit services performed by Crowe and BDO for the Company in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 and described above were pre-approved by the audit committee in accordance with the foregoing procedures.\nPART IV Item 15: Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules\n(a)\n(1) The following financial statements and related documents of Republic First Bancorp, Inc. are filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Part II - Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data:\na.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020;\nb.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019;\nc.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019;\nd.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019;\ne.\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders Equity for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019; and\nf.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(a)\n(2) None\n(a)\n(3) The exhibits filed or furnished, as applicable, as part of this report are listed under Exhibits at subsection (b) of this Item 15.\n(b)\nExhibits\nThe following Exhibits are filed as part of this report.\nExhibit\nNumber\nDescription\nLocation\n3.1\nAmended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of Republic First Bancorp, Inc.\nIncorporated by reference to Form 10-K filed March 10, 2017\n3.2\nStatement with Respect to Shares regarding 7.0% Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A of Republic First Bancorp, Inc.\nIncorporated by reference to Form 8-K filed August 21, 2020\n3.3\nAmended and Restated By-Laws of Republic First Bancorp, Inc.\nIncorporated by reference to Form 10-Q filed May 11, 2020\n4.1\nThe Company will furnish to the SEC upon request copies of the following documents relating to the Companys Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debt Securities due 2037: (i) Indenture dated as of December 27, 2006, between the Company and Wilmington Trust Company, as trustee; (ii) Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust of Republic Capital Trust II, dated as of December 27, 2006; and (iii) Guarantee Agreement dated as of December 27, 2006, between the Company and Wilmington Trust Company, as trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the capital securities of Republic Capital Trust II\n4.2\nThe Company will furnish to the SEC upon request copies of the following documents relating to the Companys Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debt Securities due 2037: (i) Indenture dated as of June 28, 2007, between the Company and Wilmington Trust Company, as trustee; (ii) Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust of Republic Capital Trust III, dated as of June 28, 2007; and (iii) Guarantee Agreement dated as of June 28, 2007, between the Company and Wilmington Trust Company, as trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the capital securities of Republic Capital Trust III\n4.3\nDescription of Capital Securities\nIncorporated by reference to Form 10-K filed March 16, 2020\nExhibit\nNumber\nDescription\nLocation\n10.1\nForm of Employment Agreement, dated July 1, 2015, by and among, certain named Executive Officers, Republic First Bancorp, Inc. and Republic First Bank*\nIncorporated by reference to Form 8-K filed July 14, 2015\n10.2\nAmended and Restated Stock Option Plan and Restricted Stock Plan*\nIncorporated by reference to Form 10-K filed March 10, 2008\n10.3\nDeferred Compensation Plan*\nIncorporated by reference to Form 10-K filed March 16, 2010\n10.4\nAmended and Restated Supplemental Retirement Plan Agreements between Republic First Bank and Certain Directors*\nIncorporated by reference to Form 10-Q filed November 7, 2008\n10.5\nAmended and Restated Employment Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2021, by and among Harry D.
