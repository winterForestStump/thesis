MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nHolders\nAs of July 31, 2023, we had 332,699,500 shares of our Common Stock par value, $.0001 issued and outstanding. There were 235 beneficial owners of our Common Stock.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent for our capital stock is VStock Transfer, LLC, with an address at 18, Lafayette Place, Woodmere, New York 11598 and telephone number is +1 (212)828-8436.\nPenny Stock Regulations\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share. Our Common Stock, when and if a trading market develops, may fall within the definition of penny stock and be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of $1,000,000, or annual incomes exceeding $200,000 individually, or $300,000, together with their spouse).\nFor transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and have received the purchasers prior written consent to the transaction. Additionally, for any transaction, other than exempt transactions, involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealers presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Consequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common Stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their Common Stock in the secondary market.\nIn addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the investors ability to buy and sell our stock.\nDividend Policy\nAny future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends on shares of our Common Stock will be made at the discretion of our board of directors out of funds legally available for such purpose. We are under no obligations or restrictions to declare or pay dividends on our shares of Common Stock. In addition, we currently have no plans to pay such dividends. Our board of directors currently intends to retain all earnings for use in the business for the foreseeable future.\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nCurrently, there is no equity compensation plan in place.\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nCurrently, there is no unregistered sales of equity securities.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Registrant and Affiliated Purchasers\nWe have not repurchased any shares of our common stock during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023.

Bhd. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. The Company has adopted July 31 as its fiscal year end.\nBasis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nUse of estimates\nManagement uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the balance sheets, and the reported revenue and expenses during the year reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.\nRevenue recognition\nIn accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts. ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contracts, which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers to its clients.\nRevenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and taxes applicable to the revenue. The Company derives its revenue from solar PV system installation services, consultancy services provided to our customers on engineering, equipment procurement and transportation, construction on solar plant.\nThe revenue from long term contract is recognized by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the end of the reporting period, the stage of completion is measured by the proportion that costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total costs. The revenue from non-contract customers is recognized upon the delivery of services.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue includes the cost of services in providing consultancy services and installation services.\nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC Topic 740). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the year that includes the enactment date.\nASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.\nNet loss per share\nThe Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.\nForeign currencies translation\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statements of operations.\nThe reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars (US$). The Companys subsidiary in Labuan and Hong Kong maintains its books and record in United States Dollars (US$) respectively, while the Companys subsidiary in Malaysia maintains its books and record in Ringgit Malaysia (MYR). Ringgit Malaysia (MYR) is functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates.\nIn general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiary whose functional currency is not the US$ are translated into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, Translation of Financial Statement, using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the year. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders equity.\nTranslation of amounts from MYR into US$1 and HK$ into US$1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective year:\nAs of and for the year ended July 31,\nYear-end MYR: US$1 exchange rate 4.55 4.45\nYear-average MYR: US$1 exchange rate 4.50 4.25\nYear-end HK$: US$1 exchange rate 7.79 7.85\nYear-average HK$: US$1 exchange rate 7.83 7.81\nRelated parties\nParties, which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.\nFair value of financial instruments:\nThe carrying value of the Companys financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and amount due to a director approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.\nThe Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820-10), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\nLevel 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Most prominent among the amendments is the recognition of assets and liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under current U.S. GAAP. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. As required by the standard, the Company will adopt the provisions of the new standard effective August 1, 2019, using the required modified retrospective approach. We believe the adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topics 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which introduced the expected credit losses methodology for the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost basis, replacing the previous incurred loss methodology. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10 highlighted the adoption timeline. For smaller reporting entities, Topic 326 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim period within those fiscal years, of which is effective for the Company on August 1, 2023.\nCredit loss rate is determined by historical collection based on aging schedule, adjusted for current conditions using reasonable and supportable forecast. Based on the aging categorization and the adjusted loss per category, an allowance for credit losses is calculated by multiplying the adjusted loss rate with the amortized cost in the respective age category.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements ITEM 7A.

This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that, as of July 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that, as of July 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.\nChanges in internal controls over financial reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended July 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Lee Chong Chow\nChief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, Director\nSet forth below is a brief description of the background and business experience of our executive officers and directors for the past five years.\nFong Teck Kheong -Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, Director\nMr. Fong started off his career as a trader in 1989. In 1992, he then joined Juara Konsep Marketing Sdn. Bhd., as a marketing manager to manage and market the products and services of the company. In 1998, Mr Fong resigned from Juana Konsep Marketing Sdn.

Also in 1998, he also established, and remains with to this day, Multi Mutual Charity Association, a Non-Profit Organization (NGO) that provides daily necessities for monthly aid distribution to women and children. The association supported more than 500 hundred single mother family during the period from 1998 to 2012.\nMr. Fong was awarded The Outstanding Young Malaysia Award for his contribution to children, world peace and human rights in 2007. In 2015, Mr. Fong founded Phoenix Plus Properties Sdn. Bhd., formerly known as Googoplex Sk Sdn. Bhd., with full swing involve in the real estate business. The Companys business plan involves project sales and sub sales, and has since accumulated turnover of up to RM260 millions. He has been the Managing Director of the Company from 2015 to present.\nOn February 28, 2023, Mr. Fong resigned from the Board of Directors of the Phoenix Plus Corp.. In connection with such resignation, he also resigned as the Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company.\nLee Chong Chow -Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, Director\nMr. Lee, aged 52, holds a Bachelor degree of Economic from Shobi University since 2005. After his graduation, he then started up a company doing small trading and investment in Japan. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster, Mr Lee dedicated himself to make best contribution to improve the human living environment and develop the sustainable energy solar power energy industry. Mr Lee has invested more than 10 companies that are specialising in green solar power until today. Mr Lee also has more than 10 years of working experiences in the solar industry companies such as Fujisolar co.ltd, Choyo Power co.ltd, Vsun co.ltd (Vietnam) and many more which are providing solar energy solutions.\nMr. Lee was appointed as Executive Director of Phoenix Plus Corp. on January 8, 2023. Subsequently on February 28, 2023, Mr. Lee was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company.\nCorporate Governance\nThe Company promotes accountability for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and in other public communications made by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. The Company has not formally adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Companys employees, officers and Directors as the Company is not required to do so.\nIn lieu of an Audit Committee, the Companys Board of Directors, is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Companys financial statements and other services provided by the Companys independent public accountants. The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company review the Companys internal accounting controls, practices and policies.\nCommittees of the Board\nOur Company currently does not have nominating, compensation, or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our Director(s) believe that it is not necessary to have such committees, at this time, because the Director(s) can adequately perform the functions of such committees.\nAudit Committee Financial Expert\nOur Board of Directors has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as independent as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14) of the FINRA Rules.\nWe believe that our Director(s) are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. The Director(s) of our Company does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because management believes that the Board of Directors can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. In addition, we believe that retaining an independent Director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash flows from operations to date.\nInvolvement in Certain Legal Proceedings\nOur Directors and our Executive officers have not been involved in any of the following events during the past ten years:\n1. bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time;\n2. any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses);\n3. being subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his/her involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; or\n4. being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated.\n5. Such person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commission to have violated any Federal or State securities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated;\n6. Such person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated any Federal commodities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated;\n7. Such person was the subject of, or a party to, any Federal or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of:(i) Any Federal or State securities or commodities law or regulation; or(ii) Any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order; or(iii) Any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or\n8. Such person was the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.\nIndependence of Directors\nWe are not required to have independent members of our Board of Directors, and do not anticipate having independent Directors until such time as we are required to do so.\nCode of Ethics\nWe have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board of Directors evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and determined that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal, business conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or Directors expand in the future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics.\nShareholder Proposals\nOur Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors. The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations for election or appointment.\nA shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President, at the address appearing on the first page of this Information Statement.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended July 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nGoing Concern\nThe financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, for the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company has accumulated deficit, negative net operating cash flow and net loss. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plan in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to those charged with governance and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nImpairment of investment\nThe Company has significant investment, which as disclosed in Note 5 to the financial statements, the Company had security investments in company without readily determinable market value. The Company adopted the guidance of ASC 321, Investments - Equity Securities, which allows an entity to measure investments in equity securities without a readily determinable fair value using a measurement alternative that measures these securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investment of same issuer (the Measurement Alternative). The Company made qualitative assessments to evaluate whether the investments are impairment and concluded that the investments will be impaired.\nWe identified the impairment valuation of investments as a critical audit matter due to the significance of the balance to the financial statements as a whole. These investments require significant judgements as they are equity securities without a readily determinable fair value and require the Company to assess if there are any changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount of an investment may require impairment. There were significant judgements made by management to identify the indicators of impairment and estimating the fair value of the investments which led to a high degree of auditor judgement, subjectivity and effort in evaluating managements estimation of the fair value of the investment including managements assessment of the equity investment financial condition, operating performance, prospects and other company-specific information.\nOur audit procedures in this area included the following, among others:\n(a) Inquired management to obtain an understanding of the Companys process in evaluating the indication of impairment and fair value assessments;\n(b) Evaluated the Companys assessment of impairment by assessing the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies used;\n(c) Compared the Companys assessment to our expectation based on our knowledge;\n(d) Considered the adequacy of the disclosure in the financial statements in relation to the investments.\nThe investment is being impaired as to Phoenix Plus Corporation, through its solicitors, is in the process to file a winding up petition to the Court of Malaysia against its investment.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company has determined that certain performance obligations in relation to project activities are satisfied over time and thus recognises revenue from this activity over time.\nA significant proportion of the Companys revenues and profits are derived from project activities. For the financial year ended July 31, 2023, project revenue and cost of sales are as follows:\nProject activities\nRevenue:\nUSD16,908\n(17% of the Companys revenue)\nCost of sales:\nUSD13,592\n(16% of the Companys cost of sales)\nWe identified revenue and cost of sales from project activities as an area requiring audit focus as significant managements judgement and estimates are involved in estimating the total project costs (which is used to determine gross profit margin of project activities undertaken by the Company). The amount of revenue and profit recognised from project activities are dependent on, amongst others, the extent of costs incurred to the total estimated costs of construction to derive the percentage-of-completion and the estimated total revenue for each of the respective projects.\nIn addressing this area of focus, we performed, amongst others, the following procedures:\n(a) Obtained an understanding of the processes and internal controls over the accuracy and timing of revenue recognised in the financial statements, including controls performed by management in estimating the total project costs, profit margin and progress of projects;\n(b) For individually significant projects, we read the contracts entered into with customers to obtain an understanding of the specific terms and conditions;\n(c) Evaluated the assumptions applied in estimating the total project costs for each project phase by examining documentary evidence such as letters of award issued to contractors to support the budgeted gross project cost. We also considered the historical accuracy of managements forecasts for the similar projects within the Company in evaluating the estimated total project costs;\n(d) Evaluated the determination of progress of projects by examining supporting evidence such as contractors progress claims and suppliers invoices.\nThe Companys disclosure on contract assets is included in Note 7 to the financial statements.\n/s/ JP CENTURION & PARTNERS PLT\nJP CENTURION & PARTNERS PLT\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2022.\nJP Centurion & Partners PLT (PCAOB: 6723)\nKuala Lumpur, Malaysia\nOctober 30, 2023\nPHOENIX PLUS CORP.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAS OF JULY 31, 2023 and 2022\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\n(Audited)\nAs of As of\nJuly 31, 2023\n(Audited) July 31, 2022\n(Audited)\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nTrade receivables $ 12,088 $ 868\nContract assets 18,723\n-\nOther receivables, prepayments and deposits 14,993 14,363\nDeferred cost\nCash at banks 1,108,039 1,537,864\nTotal current assets 1,154,167 1,553,859\nNon-current assets\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 9,715 2,982\nLease right-of-use asset 86,817 25,781\nEquity method investment -

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described in this note and elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, for the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of $2,149,650, negative operating cash flow of $418,018 and net loss of $389,237. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Companys ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving its profitability and the continuing financial support from its major shareholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the Companys obligations as they become due. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its stock holders, in the case of equity financing.\nBasis of presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements for Phoenix Plus Corp. and its subsidiaries for the year ended July 31, 2023 is prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP) and include the accounts of Phoenix Plus Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Phoenix Plus Corp., Phoenix Plus International Limited and Phoenix Green Energy Sdn. Bhd.. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. The Company has adopted July 31 as its fiscal year end.\nBasis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries in which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nPHOENIX PLUS CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JULY 31, 2023 AND 2022\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\nUse of estimates\nManagement uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the balance sheets, and the reported revenue and expenses during the year reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nRevenue recognition\nIn accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts. ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contracts, which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers to its clients.\nRevenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and taxes applicable to the revenue. The Company derives its revenue from provision of technical consultancy on solar power system and consultancy on green energy solution.\nThe revenue from long term contract is recognized by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the end of the reporting period, the stage of completion is measured by the proportion that costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total costs. The revenue from non-contract customers is recognized upon the delivery of services.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue includes the cost of services and product in providing business mentoring, nurturing, incubating and corporate development advisory services.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational:\nSCHEDULE OF PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE\nClassification\nEstimated useful life\nLeasehold improvement\nmonths\nComputer hardware and software\nyears\nTools and gauges\nyears\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The gain or loss on the disposal of property, plant and equipment is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant assets and is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nInvestment under equity method\nThe Company apply the equity method to account for investments it possesses the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when the investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee.\nIn applying the equity method, the Company records the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the investee. The Company records dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment.\nIncome taxes\nThe provision of income taxes is determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the year that includes the enactment date.\nASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.\nPHOENIX PLUS CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JULY 31, 2023 AND 2022\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\nNet loss per share\nThe Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260 Earnings per share. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.\nForeign currencies translation\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statements of operations.\nThe reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars (US$). The Companys subsidiary in Labuan and Hong Kong maintains its books and record in United States Dollars (US$) respectively, while the Companys subsidiary in Malaysia maintains its books and record in Ringgit Malaysia (MYR). Ringgit Malaysia (MYR) is functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates.\nIn general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiary whose functional currency is not the US$ are translated into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, Translation of Financial Statement, using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the year. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders equity.\nTranslation of amounts from MYR into US$1 and HK$ into US$1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective years:\nSCHEDULE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\nAs of and for the year ended July 31,\nYear-end MYR: US$1 exchange rate 4.55 4.45\nYear-average MYR: US$1 exchange rate 4.50 4.25\nYear-end HK$: US$1 exchange rate 7.79 7.85\nYear-average HK$: US$1 exchange rate 7.83 7.81\nRelated parties\nParties, which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.\nPHOENIX PLUS CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JULY 31, 2023 AND 2022\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\nFair value of financial instruments:\nThe carrying value of the Companys financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, prepayments, deposits, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and amount due to a director approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.\nThe Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820-10), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\nLevel 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nLeases\nPrior to August 1, 2019, the Company accounted for leases under ASC 840, Accounting for Leases. Effective August 1, 2019, the Company adopted the guidance of ASC 842, Leases, which requires an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all leases. The implementation of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements and did not have a significant impact on our liquidity. The Company adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective approach. As a result, the comparative financial information has not been updated and the required disclosures prior to the date of adoption have not been updated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those years. (See Note 11)\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nASB issues various Accounting Standards Updates relating to the treatment and recording of certain accounting transactions. On June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915) Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation, which eliminates the concept of a development stage entity (DSE) entirely from current accounting guidance. The Company has elected adoption of this standard, which eliminates the designation of DSEs and the requirement to disclose results of operations and cash flows since inception.\nIn May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, which is an update to ASU Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which introduced the expected credit losses methodology for the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost basis, replacing the previous incurred loss methodology. The amendments in Update 2016-13 added Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, and made several consequential amendments to the Codification. The amendments in this Update address those stakeholders concerns by providing an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option for certain financial assets previously measured at amortized cost basis. For those entities, the targeted transition relief will increase comparability of financial statement information by providing an option to align measurement methodologies for similar financial assets. Furthermore, the targeted transition relief also may reduce the costs for some entities to comply with the amendments in Update 2016-13 while still providing financial statement users with decision-useful information. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, which to update the effective date of ASU No. 2016-13 for private companies, not-for-profit organizations and certain smaller reporting companies applying for credit losses, leases, and hedging standard. The new effective date for these preparers is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. ASU 2019-05 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2023 as the Company is qualified as a smaller reporting company.

SEGMENT INFORMATION\nASC 280, Segment Reporting establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments on a basis consistent with the Companys internal organization structure as well as information about services categories, business segments and major customers in financial statements. In accordance with the Segment Reporting Topic of the ASC, the Companys chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer and President, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance, which is based on a management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major customers, and the countries in which the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under Segment Reporting due to their similar customer base and similarities in economic characteristics; nature of products and services; and procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes.\nThe Company had no inter-segment sales for the periods presented. Summarized financial information concerning the Companys reportable segments is shown as below:\nSCHEDULE OF INTER-SEGMENT SALES\nBy Geography:\nUnited States Malaysia Hong Kong Total\nFor the year ended July 31, 2023\nUnited States Malaysia Hong Kong Total\nRevenue $ - $ 99,833 $ - $ 99,833\nCost of revenue - (84,322 ) - (84,322 )\nNet loss (58,593 ) (188,422 ) (142,222 ) (389,237 )\nTotal assets $ - $ 1,183,671 $ 67,028 $ 1,250,699\nUnited States Malaysia Hong Kong Total\nFor the year ended July 31, 2022\nUnited States Malaysia Hong Kong Total\nRevenue $ - $ 908 $ 19,918 $ 20,826\nCost of revenue - (659 ) (16,328 ) (16,987 )\nNet loss (357,958 ) (99,505 ) (152,154 ) (609,617 )\nTotal assets $ - $ 1,489,942 $ 92,680 $ 1,582,622\n17.

This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Companys ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Management is taking various steps to provide the Company with the opportunity to continue as a going concern.\n18. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events, which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued, the Company has evaluated all events or transactions that occurred after July 31, 2023 up through the date the Company issued the audited consolidated financial statements. During this period, there was no subsequent event that required recognition or disclosure, except for those disclose elsewhere in the financial statements."
