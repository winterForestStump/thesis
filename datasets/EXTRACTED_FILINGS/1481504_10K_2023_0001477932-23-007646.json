As of the date of this filing, we remain engaged in dialogue with XTI to enforce compliance with the Letter Agreement and to find an amicable resolution, although no assurance can be given that such a resolution will be achieved.\nEffective April 2, 2022, the Company entered into a Joint Venture with Movychem s.r.o., a Slovakian limited liability company (Movychem), called Ebenberg, LLC, setting forth the terms for the establishment of a joint venture to exploit the Movychem Intellectual Property and the Purchased Patents. The JV was organized as a Florida limited liability company and was owned 50% by each of the Company and Movychem. Effective June 30, 2023, the Joint Venture was terminated, and the entity will be subsequently dissolved.\nOUR BUSINESS SUMMARY\nIntroduction\nThe Space Race fueled global competition to own the skies, and led to break-neck innovations in aerospace, technology and advanced materials. From the first manned space flight to the first man on the Moon, aerospace has been at the leading edge of some of the most important technological, design and engineering breakthroughs that have ever impacted global industry. The commercialization of transformative aerospace technologies, including eco-friendly specialty materials, has been successfully deployed and integrated across multiple industry sectors, and has led to a more prosperous and interconnected global economy. These advancements are producing next-generation materials that can affect every facet of our lives with improved safety, durability and decreased environmental impact.\nCompany Overview\nAdvanced Materials\nA primary focus of our Company is the acquisition and commercial exploitation of eco-friendly, advanced materials and chemicals which have applications across a broad range of industries and the potential to generate significant near-term revenue. Our commercialization strategy encompasses licensing arrangements and joint ventures, which would allow for more rapid access to the market with reduced capital requirements and financial risk. In addition to providing the production and distribution infrastructure, these established partnering companies can streamline testing and certification and add brand recognition value. Once manufacturing has been established at sufficient production capabilities, the advanced materials and chemicals may be sold as standalone products, enhancements to existing products, or used in the development of proprietary products under a new trademarked brand owned by the Company. We are exploring manufacturing and branding opportunities for specific products derived from advanced materials and chemicals acquired or developed, which would involve setting up production facilities, equipment, systems and supply chain.\nEffective April 2, 2022, we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with Movychem s.r.o, a Slovakian chemical company, setting forth the terms for a joint venture (referred to herein as the Movychem JV) to exploit the Movychem Intellectual Property and the Purchased Patents. The Movychem JV, owned 50% by Xeriant and 50% by Movychem, subject to certain funding conditions, was granted the exclusive worldwide rights to the intellectual property related to Retacell\u00ae, an industrial flame-retardant, and would be responsible for developing applications and commercializing products.\nOn June 8, 2022, Xeriant announced the development of a multi-purpose, high-strength fire- and water-resistant composite panel made from a formulation of Retacell\u00ae and a cardboard fiber-reinforced polymeric resin. The panel described in the press release was initially produced in a benchtop setting.\nAfter experiencing a number of issues, including but not limited to Movychems unwillingness to provide material documentation, processes and information required for the exploitation of Retacell\u00ae, the Company independently developed an upcycled construction panel, without the inclusion of Retacell\u00ae, outside of the Movychem JV.\nOn July 11, 2023, Xeriant announced the successful testing of a proprietary high-volume production process for an environmentally friendly patent-pending composite construction panel (NexBoard) that can be produced in the United States at industrial scale. This approach will enable the Company to unlock existing demand indicated by several homebuilders and developers seeking environmentally friendly construction panels in varying thicknesses and sizes, including standard 48 x 96 sheets, economically and with consistency and efficiency.\nBecause of Movychems non-performance as described above, Xeriant ceased paying Movychem $25,000 per month as required in the Joint Venture beginning December 2022. On February 13, 2023, Movychem formally requested dissolution of its Joint Venture with Xeriant, Ebenberg, LLC. On February 24, 2023, Xeriant provided a formal response to Movychem, highlighting its multiple and sustained lapses in collaborative efforts related to the commercialization of the Retacell\u00ae technology. Subsequent to this communication, Xeriant expressly repudiated Movychems proposition for dissolution and their proposition to take an exclusive territory to market Retacell\u00ae. Because Xeriant is focused on the commercialization and industrial-level production of eco-friendly composite construction panels, and has moved beyond the Retacell\u00ae technology, the Company agreed to dissolution of the Ebenberg, LLC Joint Venture effective June 30, 2023.\nOn March 31, 2023, we filed a provisional patent application titled Multilayered Fire-Resistant Polymer Composite and Method for Producing Same, for a method of producing a unique fire-resistant thermoplastic and fiber composite material which may be formed or shaped into various construction products of different thicknesses and dimensions. This green material will be composed primarily of recycled plastic, cellulose and eco-friendly fire-retardant chemicals, including but not limited to use in walls, ceilings, flooring, framing, siding, roofing, molding, and decking, used in construction. Subject to available capital, we are planning to build manufacturing facilities in the United States for the production of NexBoardTM in order to meet market demand, or alternatively license the technology and process. We have identified potential sites for near-term contract manufacturing, a pilot plant, and large manufacturing facilities, received bids for specialized manufacturing equipment, developed timetables related to the action plan, and hired a managing director with decades of experience to oversee the projects.\nOn July 30, 2023, we filed the trademark BlueGreen for ecofriendly composite building products and Durever\u2122 for the same categories on July 31, 2023.\nAerospace\nAnother area of interest for our Company continues to be the emerging aviation market called Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), the transition to more efficient, eco-friendly, automated and convenient flight operations enabled by the convergence of technological advancements in design and engineering, composite materials, propulsion systems, battery energy density and manufacturing processes. Next-generation aircraft being developed for this market offer low-cost, on-demand flight for passengers and cargo, utilizing lower altitude airspace and bypassing the traditional hub and spoke airport network with vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities. Many of these lightweight aircraft are electrically powered through either hybrid or pure battery systems, which allows for quieter, low emission flights over urban areas, however with limited speed and range. The adoption and integration of niche aerial services through AAM is expected to provide benefits throughout the economy. We plan to partner with and acquire strategic interests in visionary companies that accelerate our mission of commercializing critical breakthrough AAM technologies which enhance performance, increase safety, and enable and support more efficient, autonomous, and sustainable flight operations, including electric and hybrid-electric passenger and cargo transport aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing. Our plan to source and acquire strategic interests in leading aerospace companies developing breakthrough VTOL aircraft began in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nEffective May 27, 2021, we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with XTI Aircraft Company (XTI), a privately owned Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) based in Englewood, Colorado, for the purpose of completing the preliminary design of XTIs TriFan 600, a 5-passenger plus pilot, hybrid electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) fixed-wing aircraft.\nThrough our joint venture with XTI, (referred to hereinafter as the XTI JV), we were involved in the successful completion of the preliminary design of their TriFan 600 eVTOL aircraft. The TriFan 600 is being designed to become the fastest, longest-range VTOL aircraft in the world and the first commercial fixed-wing VTOL airplane, with current pre-orders of approximately seven billion dollars in gross revenue upon delivery of those aircraft.\nThe purpose of the XTI JV, preliminary design review (PDR), had been achieved during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. At that point, Xeriant had funded approximately $5.5 million into the XTI JV.\nOn May 17, 2022, Xeriant signed a Letter Agreement with XTI related to the introduction of XTI to the Nasdaq company, Inpixon. Under this Letter Agreement, if there was a combination or other transaction between XTI and Inpixon, Xeriant would receive compensation of 6 percent of XTI fully diluted on a pre-merger basis, and XTI would assume the obligations of Xeriants Senior Secured Note with Auctus Fund, LLC. On July 25, 2023, Inpixon filed an 8-K, announcing their intention to merge with XTI having executed an Agreement of Plan and Merger. The filing also showed that XTI had engaged in a transaction with Inpixon on March 10, 2023, receiving $300,000 in funding. Inpixon subsequently filed an S-4/A registration statement on October 6, 2023. Due to the disclosures in the XTI and Inpixon filings, we believe Xeriant is entitled to the compensation provided in its Letter Agreement with XTI. XTI and Inpixon are disputing the fact that the Letter Agreement gives rise to compensation to the Company. Please refer to the discussion in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the dispute. As of the date of this filing, we remain engaged in dialogue with XTI to enforce compliance with the Letter Agreement and to find an amicable resolution, although no assurance can be given that such a resolution will be achieved.\nIn the area of aerospace, management believes that Xeriant can grow expeditiously by acquiring technology and assets primarily through acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and licensing arrangements. As a publicly traded company, we offer our subsidiaries such benefits as improved access to capital, higher valuations and lower risk through the shared ownership of a diversified portfolio, while allowing these entities to maintain independence in their distinct operations to focus on their fields of expertise. Cost savings and efficiencies may be realized from sharing non-operational functions such as finance, legal, tax, sales and marketing, human resources, purchasing power, as well as investor and public relations.\nThe Company is trading on the OTCQB Venture Market under the stock symbol, XERI.\nIndustry Overview\nAerospace innovation has been at the forefront of many important scientific, technological, design and engineering breakthroughs which have had broad implications across non-aerospace sectors of the economy. Research and development initiatives originally intended for aerospace applications have contributed to advances in health care, transportation, telecommunications, agriculture, manufacturing and materials, and have led to the commercialization of new technologies and products that have positively impacted our daily lives.\nOne of the most recognized areas of research where the aerospace industry has played a major role is polymer chemistry, which includes the development of plastics technologies and fire retardants in plastics, coatings and adhesives. Technical improvements in aircraft design have shifted from a focus on speed and range to efficiency and sustainability, creating the need for advanced materials in aerostructures and engines that are lightweight and resistant to extreme heat. Plastic composites using carbon fiber are increasingly used in the structural components of aircraft, replacing aluminum. Additionally, aircraft interior design incorporates lighter, flame-resistant polymer materials and engineered alloys for panels, seats and various components to reduce weight.\nAdvanced polymer materials with superior performance characteristics, including flame-resistance with non-toxic gases, have wide applicability in the construction industry. Plastic composite boards may be fabricated from a range of polymers, including polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyamide (PA), which are inherently water-resistant, and reinforced with a variety of materials, including cardboard fiber, fiberglass, wood or carbon, which provide increased mechanical strength. Additives, surface treatments and decorative finishes can further enhance the properties of the boards, which can be manufactured in standard sizes and become a replacement for gypsum and wood-based structural panels such as drywall, plywood, Oriented Strand Board (OSB) and Medium Density Fiberboard (MDF), and flooring. Plastic composite boards made from recycled plastics and fiber are considered green building products, not only because they decrease the amount of waste materials from landfills, but because they have insulating properties that can cut energy costs. When infused with a non-toxic flame retardant, these eco-friendly composite panels can be an effective passive fire protection system, providing superior safety and minimizing property damage from flame spread and smoke.\nThe construction industry is seeing an accelerating demand for sustainable building practices, which is expected to drive the market growth of green building materials, as well as promote the use of non-toxic chemicals, including flame retardants. Green building materials are an environmentally friendly solution because they are produced from safe, recyclable products, which help in conserving non-renewable resources and mitigating environmental and human health considerations. Moreover, green building materials have become a durable and energy-efficient solution that makes them suitable for various infrastructure applications. As part of a major rebuilding of aging infrastructure across the globe, investments in renovations and retrofit construction, including the replacement of decaying underground materials, often mandate the use of green materials and building methods. New construction of governmental buildings, office complexes, schools and residential structures is increasingly employing eco-friendly alternatives for insulation, concrete, wallboard and rebar, which often have similar or superior performance when compared with conventional materials. Several developing countries are launching programs with subsidies and incentives to spur growth in the market and spread awareness about alternative construction methods with the goal of supplying affordable and sustainable housing. In the U.S., LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is the most widely used rating system for green building practices.\nBelow are some compelling statistics and forecasts in support of the development and commercialization of green building products, including non-toxic flame-retardant chemicals:\n\u00b7\nSustainable investments total USD 35.3 trillion, or 36% of all assets in five of the world's biggest markets, according to a report from the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance.\n\u00b7\nAccording to Research and Markets, global investments in sustainable and green technologies for smart cities and megaprojects is expected to reach USD 6.96 trillion by 2030, which represents a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 24.2%, which is expected to result in a rising demand for wood plastic composites and creating opportunities for interior construction manufacturers.\n\u00b7\nThe global green building materials market exceeded USD 265 billion in 2021 and is poised for a 12% CAGR from 2022 to 2028, reaching USD 586 billion by 2028, based on a report by Global Market Insights.\n\u00b7\nThe global green building materials market from residential applications is set to account for USD 330 billion by 2028, according to Global Market Insights.\n\u00b7\nThe global drywall and gypsum board market size is estimated to grow from USD 50.22 billion in 2020 to USD 95.15 billion in 2027, registering a CAGR of 11.24% during the forecast period (2021-2027), based on a report by Market Statsville Group.\n\u00b7\nThe global plywood market size is estimated to be valued at USD 80.5 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach a valuation of USD 115 billion by 2028, based on a CAGR of 6.1%, according to Future Market Insights.\n\u00b7\nAccording to Allied Market Research, the global OSB market size was valued at USD 25.6 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach USD 44.3 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR or 5.4% from 2021 -

Next-generation aircraft are more efficient, sustainable, reliable, automated and safer through technological improvements in design optimization and modeling, advanced materials, artificial intelligence, alternative propulsion systems and manufacturing processes. Many of the airframe configurations enabled by these developments are being designed for the emerging aviation market called Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), the integration of new aircraft designs and flight technologies to move people and cargo between places not usually served by existing ground or air transportation. Common technologies in AAM include electric propulsion, short and vertical takeoff/landing techniques, composite materials, and the ability to remotely or autonomously pilot aircraft. In addition to being quieter with less or no carbon emissions, it is anticipated that these new aircraft will have lower operating, maintenance, and repair costs compared with other aircraft, including helicopters.\nBelow are some compelling statistics and forecasts in support of the development and commercialization of aerospace technologies related to AAM:\n\u00b7\nInvestment bank Morgan Stanley forecasts a USD 1 trillion total addressable market for electrically powered autonomous passenger and cargo air transport vehicles by 2040, and USD 9 trillion by 2050.\n\u00b7\nNearly half of all flights globally are short-haul routes, less than 500 miles, which presents a significant opportunity for electrically powered aircraft.\n\u00b7\nAlmost 3,000 general aviation airports in the U.S. have no scheduled passenger flights but are being maintained by the federal government through funds appropriated by Congress. These airports can be utilized for flights by electrically powered aircraft to connect underserved areas, ultimately creating a more distributed air transportation network.\n\u00b7\nBetween now and 2040, there will be an estimated global demand for almost 40,000 new passenger and cargo aircraft, 75 percent of which are smaller airliners targeting short-haul routes, according to Airbus.\n\u00b7\nOptimization of airframe configurations to improve aerodynamics, including propulsion- airframe integration, can contribute as much as 20-25 percent in fuel consumption reduction.\n\u00b7\nIn December 2019, the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) issued new proposed rules for remote identification of unmanned aircraft, indicating its serious intent to integrate these aircraft systems into the national airspace.\n\u00b7\nAgility Prime was recently created by the U.S. Air Force to help accelerate the regulatory process for the integration of commercial advanced air mobility vehicles, like flying cars, into our air transportation system.\n\u00b7\nIn June 2020, the FAA in collaboration with NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and industry organizations published the Concept of Operations for Urban Air Mobility to describe the envisioned operational environment that supports the expected growth of flight operations in urban areas.\n\u00b7\nThe United Nations projects that by 2050, 68 percent of the worlds population will live in urban areas, up from 55 percent today, resulting in increased traffic congestion, stress and air pollution.\n\u00b7\nAirlines for America (A4A), the industry trade organization representing the leading U.S. airlines, has committed to the recommendations of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations body that sets standards and recommended practices for international aviation, including carbon-neutral growth from 2020 with an aspirational goal of a 50 percent reduction in CO2 by 2050 relative to 2005 levels.\n\u00b7\nThe Advisory Council for Aeronautics Research in Europe has set goals of a 75 percent reduction in CO2 emissions per passenger and a 65 percent reduction in perceived noise emissions by 2050.\nThe Research Park at Florida Atlantic University\nIn August 2019, Xeriant was approved by the Florida Atlantic Research and Development Authority to become a member and tenant of the Research Park at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) in Boca Raton, Florida, which is part of the university and adjacent to the Boca Raton Airport. FAU is one of the top engineering schools in the state, and part of the National Science Foundations Industry/University Cooperative Research Center Program called the Center for Advanced Knowledge Enablement (CAKE). The 70-acre Research Park, home to many technology companies and research-based organizations, is the site of Xeriants main office. FAU recently opened a center for Artificial Intelligence and Connected Assured Autonomy through their College of Engineering and Computer Science, which is applicable to advanced aircraft systems. The Company is engaging with FAUs academic team, both faculty and students, to assist in screening and validating various technologies and to work together in a series of joint research initiatives. The relationship with FAU gives Xeriant credibility, since few companies are selected for membership in its research park and may provide access to grant programs and financing opportunities. Universities continue to be an indispensable source for novel discoveries in science and technology, with an impressive history of innovations that changed the world. Research parks have become the intermediaries between these academic institutions and industry, a hybrid of two diverse cultures that foster a dynamic innovation ecosystem of technology transfer, economic development and the generation of skilled labor. Faculty members often play a direct role in furthering the commercialization of technologies by launching new companies.\nIntellectual Property\nOn March 31, 2023, the Company filed a provisional patent application titled Multilayered Fire-Resistant Polymer Composite and Method for Producing Same, for a method of producing a unique fire-resistant thermoplastic and fiber composite material which may be formed or shaped into various construction products of different thicknesses and dimensions. This green material will be composed primarily of recycled plastic, cellulose and ecofriendly fire-retardant chemicals, including but not limited to use in walls, ceilings, flooring, framing, siding, roofing, molding, and decking, used in construction.\nXeriant owns a 64% interest in its subsidiary, American Aviation Technologies, LLC (AAT). AAT owns a patented VTOL drone/aircraft concept called Halo. All intellectual property rights to Halo, including patents and applications for patents, were acquired on October 2, 2018.

We have identified early-stage technology companies, as well as established companies that have been confined to a limited geographical area, have developed breakthrough, high-market-potential technologies, and that are past the concept/seed capital stage. Some companies are already generating revenue while others have a clear path to revenue. Many are acquisition targets or have the potential for a combination or roll-up. In some cases, their technology originated and was developed out of an academic environment. As a strategic partner or acquiror, we provide companies with access to capital, liquidity through an exchange of equity, new market opportunities and synergistic contacts, and university relationships for research and grants, while maintaining partners operational independence. We believe entrepreneurial spirit, passion, and vision are critical to success, and we believe that we can provide strategic guidance, access to financial markets, and investor liquidity.\nOver the past couple of years, the Company has been involved with developing and commercializing ecofriendly building products made with a proprietary flame retardant and recycled materials, now branded Durever\u2122, and NexBoardTM as a replacement for drywall and other building products. This innovation has generated strong interest from key players in the real estate development and construction industry and building materials retailers in the U.S., who are looking to participate in the circular economy and for alternatives to the hazardous waste created from drywall, toxic chemicals used in some flame retardants, and wood because of deforestation and its degradation when exposed to fire or water. The global green construction materials market, estimated at USD 318 billion in 2021, is projected to reach $575 Billion by 2027, based on a report by Emergen Research. The global market for green building materials is forecasted to reach $951 billion by 2030 according to a report by Fortune Business Insights.\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global building materials market related to gypsum wallboards, plywood, OSB, flooring and siding was valued at USD 838.1 billion in 2021 and is forecasted to reach USD 1,092.4 billion by 2025. The green building materials market was valued at USD 256.5 billion in 2021 and is projected at USD 350.3 billion in 2025, based on a study by Allied Market Research.\nOn May 31, 2021, the Company entered into a 50-50 joint venture with XTI Aircraft Company to complete the preliminary design phase in the development of the TriFan 600, a hybrid-electric fixed-wing VTOL aircraft that uses three ducted fans for vertical lift. The TriFan 600 would be the fastest and longest-range VTOL aircraft in the world, and the first commercial fixed-wing VTOL airplane. The TriFan 600 has a maximum cruise speed of 345 mph and a range of over 850 miles with conventional takeoff and landing, and 700 miles when taking off and landing vertically, which is far superior to other leading eVTOL aircraft in development. In comparison, Lilium Jet, Joby Aviations S4, and the Archer Maker have published maximum cruise speeds of 175 mph, 200 mph, and 200 mph respectively, with ranges of 150 miles, 150 miles, and 60 miles respectfully. The TriFan 600 can be configured with the standard six seats (5 passengers + pilot), nine seats for air taxi routes (8 passengers + pilot), or as an emergency medical aircraft. As a scalable platform, there is also a cargo variant called the TriFan 200 and a 12-15 seat model. XTIs management team includes the former top executives of Aereon Supersonic, Gulfstream, Citation, Skunk Works, Textron, Cessna Aircraft, and AVX Aircraft who, combined, have developed and certified more than 40 new aircraft designs over their careers. There are approximately 700 presales or reservations for the TriFan 600 representing approximately $7 billion in potential future revenue. Upon dissolution of the joint venture, Xeriant will receive a direct interest in XTI aircraft.\nUnder a Letter Agreement executed on May 17, 2022, between Xeriant and XTI, in conjunction with their joint venture, Xeriant would receive additional compensation for its introduction of XTI to Inpixon, a Nasdaq-listed company, if a combination or any other transaction occurs between the parties. On July 25, 2023, it was announced through an 8-K filed by Inpixon, that an Agreement of Plan and Merger had been executed between XTI and Inpixon. Due to the disclosures in the XTI and Inpixon filings, we believe Xeriant is entitled to the compensation provided in its Letter Agreement with XTI. As of the date of this filing, we remain engaged in dialogue with XTI to enforce compliance with the Letter Agreement and to find an amicable resolution, although no assurance can be given that such a resolution will be achieved.\nA cross-section of Morgan Stanley Researchs equity analysts last year detailed how investment in autonomous flying aircraft is accelerating. The BluePaper described implications for the future of passenger travel, military and defense applications, and freight and package transportation, and projected a total addressable market of $1.5 trillion for autonomous aircraft by 2040.\nXeriant focuses on disruptive technology with broad applications across high value industries. Categories include a broad range of disciplines impacting areas such as advanced materials, AI, sensors, communications, navigation and defense. Target companies and technologies should have significant upside potential, unique I/P, roll up or combination potential, have a quality team in place to execute their business plan, and need funding for execution or growth.\nDevelopment Strategy\nXeriant is dedicated to the acquisition, development and commercialization of transformative aerospace technologies, including eco-friendly specialty materials which can be successfully deployed and integrated across multiple industry sectors, and disruptive innovations related to the emerging aviation market called Advanced Air Mobility, which include next-generation aircraft. We seek to partner with and acquire strategic interests in visionary companies that accelerate this mission.\nThe Company is planning to commercialize a slate of ecofriendly building products under the Durever\u2122 brand, mainly through licensing arrangements with major industry leaders, which would allow for more rapid access to the market with reduced capital requirements and financial risk. Our flagship product is a multi-purpose, high-strength fire- and water-resistant composite panel made from a formulation of a proprietary flame retardant and a cellulose fiber-reinforced polymeric resin, called NexBoardTM, which will be sourced from recycled materials.\nThe Company is currently investigating the requirements to buildout manufacturing facilities in the United States and Eastern Europe to meet the demand for its composite wallboards. We have identified potential sites, located and priced specialized manufacturing equipment, started to formulate timetables, and hired a managing director with decades of experience to oversee the advanced materials division. Our success will be dependent on available of capital and feedstock.\nXeriant maintains its interest in AAM through its investment in the XTI joint venture as it believes the market segment and its related technological advancements will lead to a more sustainable future. The Company was involved in the successful completion of the preliminary design of their TriFan 600 eVTOL aircraft. The TriFan 600 is being designed to become the fastest, longest-range VTOL aircraft in the world and the first commercial fixed-wing VTOL airplane, with current pre-orders and reservations of approximately $7 billion in gross revenues upon delivery of those aircraft. Morgan Stanley is forecasting a $1 trillion total addressable global market for eVTOL aircraft and AAM by 2040, which is projected to reach $9 trillion by 2050.\nXeriant is currently exploring relationships with several aerospace companies that have aircraft platforms, or are working to solve issues related to lightweighting, hypersonics, additive manufacturing, miniaturization, AI, safety, autonomy, wireless connectivity, electric propulsion, batteries, hydrogen, navigation systems, computer processing, camera systems, stabilization equipment, imaging sensors and analytics software. Xeriant is pursuing strategic alliances with companies that provide complementary aircraft platforms and technologies and access to new markets.\nCONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should give careful consideration to the following risk factors, including our financial statements and related notes, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of the adverse developments described in the following risk factors could materially and adversely harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL NEEDS\nWe are in our development stage and have a limited operating history.\nWe are a development-stage enterprise with a limited operating history with no sales, and operating losses since its inception. We will need to continue building our organization and team to competently evaluate and secure business opportunities for the development of sophisticated technologies. As an early-stage business we will likely encounter unforeseen costs, expenses, competition and other problems to which such businesses are often subject. Our likelihood of success will depend on the problems, uncertainties, unexpected costs, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in developing and expanding a new business and the competitive environment in which we plan to operate. If we fail to successfully address these risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed.\nWe anticipate operating losses to continue into the foreseeable future and substantial additional capital may be required that may not be available on acceptable terms.\nCurrently, there is no revenue being generated and we have significant operating losses that are expected to continue into the foreseeable future. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise the capital that will be required to sustain operations and execute our business plan, which involves raising capital for acquisitions as well as developing and commercializing technologies. We are especially focused on the green construction materials business, namely Durever\u2122 building products, which includes a line of composite products primarily made from recycled thermoplastics, reinforcement materials and fire-retardant chemicals for use in walls, ceilings, flooring, framing, siding, roofing, molding and decking. The production of green building materials requires establishing manufacturing operations in the United States. Should we be unable to raise sufficient capital required to build manufacturing facilities to produce NexBoardTM products, we would lose the ability to deliver NexBoard to interested buyers and incur continued operating losses.\nWe expect capital outlays and operating expenditures to increase as we expand our product offerings and marketing activities. Our business or operations may change in a manner that would consume available funds more rapidly than anticipated, and substantial additional funding may be required to maintain operations, fund expansion, develop new or enhanced products or services, acquire complementary products, businesses or technologies or otherwise respond to competitive pressures and opportunities. Furthermore, any equity or debt financings, if available at all, may be on terms which are not favorable to the Company (and therefore its shareholders) and, in the case of a new equity offering by the Company, existing shareholders will be diluted unless they purchase their proportionate share of the equity offering. If adequate capital is not available on economically viable terms and conditions, the Companys business, operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nWe will need to meet the obligations required by the Auctus Fund, LLC Senior Secured Note and the Amendment to the Note.\nThe Company is in active negotiations with Auctus Fund, LLC, to extend the maturity date of the Senior Secured Promissory Note, which became due and payable on March 15, 2023. On June 1, 2023, the SEC filed a complaint against Auctus claiming that the company was operating as an unlicensed broker-dealer and the loans could result in cancellation. At this time, there is no assurance that the SEC will be successful in its effort, or the Company will work out a favorable extension of this note. One of the related obligations of the Company is to uplist to a major exchange. If we do not perform under the Note, and Auctus elects to enforce the Note, we may lose all or substantially all of our assets. If Auctus elects to convert the note into shares of our Common Stock, our shareholders could experience substantial dilution.\nOn May 17, 2022, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement with XTI whereby Xeriant would receive compensation for introducing Inpixon, a Nasdaq-listed company, to XTI for a combination or any other transaction. Should a combination or any other transaction occur, the compensation due to Xeriant would include a six percent (6%) fully diluted interest in XTI upon dissolution of its Joint Venture with Xeriant, and XTI would assume Xeriants obligations under its Senior Secured Note with Auctus Fund, LLC. On July 25, 2023, Inpixon filed an 8-K announcing that they had signed an Agreement of Plan and Merger with XTI. On October 6, 2023, Inpixon filed an S4/A for the business combination with XTI. Due to the disclosures in the XTI and Inpixon filings, we believe Xeriant is entitled to the compensation provided in its Letter Agreement with XTI. As of the date of this filing, we remain engaged in dialogue with XTI to enforce compliance with the Letter Agreement and to find an amicable resolution, although no assurance can be given that such a resolution will be achieved.\nOn June 1, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (hereinafter referred to as the \"SEC\") filed a complaint against Auctus Fund Management, LLC and its principals, Louis Posner and Alfred Sollami, predicated on their alleged failure to duly register as securities dealers in compliance with SEC regulations.\nThe SEC complaint imputes Auctus Management, Mr. Sollami, and Mr. Posner with breaches of Sections 15(a)(1) and 20(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Pursuant to these charges, the SEC is actively seeking the imposition of permanent injunctions, disgorgement of any unauthorized proceeds coupled with the associated prejudgment interest, civil pecuniary sanctions, proscriptions related to penny stock dealings, and other forms of just and equitable relief. Additionally, the SEC complaint incorporates Auctus Fund as a relief defendant and thereby endeavors to secure disgorgement from Auctus Fund, of ill-gotten gains from the activities of Auctus Management, Mr. Sollami, and Mr. Posner.\nFrom page three of the complaint, The Commission requests that this Court enjoin Defendants from committing further violations of the federal securities laws as alleged in this Complaint, and order the Defendants along with Relief Defendant Auctus Fund to disgorge ill-gotten gains along with prejudgment interest thereon, order the Defendants to pay monetary penalties based upon these violations, order penny stock bars as to the Defendants, and order the surrender and cancellation of any securities (including convertible notes, warrants, and shares) obtained by Auctus in connection with its convertible notes business between 2012 and 2021, which are still held by Auctus.\nGiven that Auctus issued a Senior Secured Promissory Note to Xeriant on October 27, 2021, we believe the SEC's order to surrender and cancel any securities obtained by Auctus in connection with its convertible notes business between 2012 and 2021 (including convertible notes, warrants, and shares), may result in the extinguishment of the Xeriant Senior Secured Promissory Note. However, since the SECs proceedings are in process and our Company remains in technical default with respect to the maturity of the Senior Secured Promissory Note as of June 30, 2023, we are actively engaged in negotiations to arrive at a potential settlement agreement with Auctus. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in these efforts.\nNot obtaining sufficient financing will jeopardize our operations and the ability to execute our business plan.\nWe need to raise additional debt and/or equity financing to fund future operations and to provide working capital. However, there is no assurance that such financing will be consummated or obtained in sufficient amounts necessary to meet our needs. If cash resources are insufficient to satisfy our on-going cash requirements, the Company will be required to scale back or discontinue its product development programs or obtain funds if available (although there can be no certainties) through strategic alliances that may require us to relinquish rights to its technology, substantially reduce or discontinue its operations entirely. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be in terms that are satisfactory to us. Even if we are able to obtain financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing. As a result, we can provide no assurance as to whether or if we will ever be profitable. If we are not able to achieve and maintain profitability, the value of our company and our common stock could decline significantly.\nOur recurring operating losses have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur recurring operating losses raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This condition is expected to continue for the foreseeable future until we can produce sufficient revenues to cover our costs as we seek to raise funding and invest in our operations as well as our sales and marketing efforts. Given this financial situation, no assurances can be given that we will be able to raise capital in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report in our consolidated financial statements for the most recent fiscal years with respect to this uncertainty. The perception of our ability to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and could result in the loss of confidence of investors, partners and employees.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS\nThere is no assurance that we or our affiliates will be able to accomplish the design and engineering needed to demonstrate that the technologies that are undertaken will perform or operate as planned.\nBecause of unanticipated technological hurdles or the inability to assemble a qualified team to address these challenges, we may not be able to meet the technology development and performance objectives that are needed to be competitive in the various targeted markets.\nThe development timeline for the development of certain technologies could expand.\nDue to unexpected challenges, the length of time to develop certain technologies may become expanded, causing cost overruns and potentially demanding the infusion of large amounts of capital and other financing, which may not be available. Because of the long timeline, there is also uncertainty regarding the uniqueness or advantages of the technologies at the time they are introduced into the market.\nSome technologies are still being developed and specific market applications have not been finalized.\nBecause some of the anticipated technologies will be in an early stage of development, there is no certainty as to which market applications will be prioritized and targeted as well as the associated timelines and costs involved when we reach that point of determination after a technology has been proven. There is no assurance that the required selling price of our technologies will be competitive.\nWe will face significant industry competition.\nMost of the targeted technologies will face significant competition from industry leaders or from well-funded entrants in the marketplace. We could face significant competition from companies who have developed or are developing alternative technologies that could render acquired technologies less competitive than planned. Many existing potential competitors are well-established, have or may have longer-standing relationships with customers and potential business partners, have or may have greater name recognition, and have or may have access to substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage our growth, our ability to implement our business strategy and our operating results will likely be materially adversely affected.\nImplementation of our business plan will place a significant strain on our management who must develop administrative, operating and financial infrastructures. To manage our business and planned growth effectively, we must successfully develop, implement, maintain and enhance our financial and accounting systems and controls, identify, hire and integrate new personnel and manage expanded operations. Salaries and benefits of additional personnel can be expected to place significant stress on our financial condition, and the availability of such qualified personnel may be limited. There is no assurance that we will be able to manage the operational requirements related to implementing our business strategy.\nWe are dependent on key personnel.\nOur success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain highly qualified, specialized and experienced management and technical personnel. In addition, as we enter new areas of technology, we will need to hire additional highly skilled personnel. Competition for personnel with the required knowledge, skill and experience may be significant, and we may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain such personnel. The inability to attract and retain the necessary managerial and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on specialized industrial eco-friendly flame retardants for use in the production of our Durever\u2122 and NexBoard products.\nA significant part of our projected operations is expected to come from the sale of Durever\u2122 and NexBoard products primarily made from recycled materials that use eco-friendly industrial flame retardants. We continue testing several different eco-friendly flame retardants to insure availability and best performance.\nOperations could be adversely affected by interruptions from suppliers of components that are beyond our control.\nOur technology, product development and sales could be adversely affected by interruptions in the supply of necessary components which are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors, suppliers and distributors. We are also dependent upon third parties to timely deliver supplies that meet our specifications at competitive prices. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of these items, including electronic components, raw materials and chemicals could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we sell. If such shortages result in increased cost of our supplies, we may not be able to pass along all of such increased costs to our customers. Such shortages or disruptions could be caused by transportation issues, inclement weather, natural disasters, increased demand, problems in production or distribution, restrictions on imports or exports, the inability of vendors to obtain credit, political instability in the countries in which suppliers and distributors are located, the financial instability of suppliers and distributors, suppliers or distributors failure to meet our standards, product quality issues, inflation, the price of gasoline, other factors relating to the suppliers and distributors and the countries in which they are located, safety regulations, warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements, the cancellation of supply or distribution agreements or an inability to renew such arrangements or to find replacements on commercially reasonable terms, or other conditions beyond our control. A shortage or interruption in the availability of certain electronic components, like servos and switchboards for industrial manufacturing equipment, chemicals, raw materials or supplies could increase costs and limit the availability of products critical to our operations, which in turn could lead to a significant reduction in our revenue.\nChanges in the economy could have a detrimental impact on the Company.\nChanges in the general economic climate could have a detrimental impact on our revenue. It is possible that recessionary pressures and other economic factors (such as declining incomes, future potential rising interest rates, higher unemployment and tax increases) may adversely affect the Company. A worsening economy such as we are currently experiencing due to the Covid-19 pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and on your investment.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted by COVID-19 or other significant public health conditions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the U.S. and global economy over the past two years, resulting in significant travel restrictions, including mandated closures and orders to shelter-in-place, and created significant disruption of supply chains and the financial markets. The extent to which our operations may be impacted by the COVID-19 or other public health conditions cannot be accurately predicted, including actions by government authorities to contain an outbreak or treat its impact. We may experience materially adverse impacts on our business due to a number of potential economic conditions. The impact of significant public health conditions may also exacerbate other risks discussed in these risk factors, any of which could have a material effect on us.\nOur success is dependent upon our keeping pace with the advances in technology.\nWe are positioned as a technology company. Some of our initiatives will be dependent on the technology of other companies. Systems and components may be impacted by rapid changes in technology, including the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could require us to make modifications to its platform. Our performance will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance our existing technology or develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of the market, license leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis. The development of our proprietary technology entails significant technical as well as business risks. We may be unsuccessful in using new technologies effectively or adapting its systems or other proprietary technology to the requirements of emerging industry standards. If we are unable to adapt to these changes and demands, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe could face liability or disruption from security breaches.\nOur technology and development process involves the storage of critical, secure and proprietary information. Our communications and computer infrastructure are potentially vulnerable to both physical and electronic invasions, such as cyberattacks and security breaches. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to defend against and lessen or correct the adverse effects of these invasions. Any such invasion could result in significant damage to us. A person who is able to circumvent the security measures employed by us could capture proprietary information; alter or destroy our information; or cause interruptions of our operations.\nMany of the regulations involving Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), including VTOL (Vertical Takeoff and Landing) aircraft and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are still being established.\nThe USDOT, FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) and other agencies at the federal, state and local levels are beginning to address some of the numerous certification, regulatory and legal challenges associated with AAM, including VTOL aircraft, UAV and unmanned aerial systems (UAS). A comprehensive set of standards and enforcement procedures for these new transport systems will need to be developed. New aircraft and their operators must undergo rigorous testing and certification, which may require new or modified airworthiness certification standards. These aircraft will also need to comply with existing regulations or be the subject of new regulations to cover their activities. Current regulations govern operating BVLOS (beyond visual line of sight), passenger transport, operating over people and public streets, privacy, transporting commercial cargo across state lines and instrument-based flight. The integration of UAS and UAM into the National Airspace System and air traffic management is a critical factor, requiring a remote identification process for these aircraft. The FAAs Unmanned Aircraft System Integration Pilot Program (IPP) will provide certification necessary to operate UAVs for certain applications. It is uncertain how new or changed laws and regulations will affect the introduction of new aerial platforms into the marketplace. The time and costs involved in obtaining these certifications and regulatory compliance may adversely impact the development process.\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFrom time to time in the normal course of our business operations, we may become subject to litigation that may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required. The cost to defend such litigation may be significant and may require a diversion of our resources. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. Insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover any liabilities with respect to these or other matters. A judgment or other liability in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could adversely affect our business and the results of our operations.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.\nWhile we intend to maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of our business. It is also not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. The failure to obtain adequate insurance coverage on terms favorable to us, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We do not have any business interruption insurance. Any business disruption could result in substantial costs and diversion from our executing our business plan.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR DEPENDENCE ON THIRD PARTIES\nWe may fail to retain or recruit necessary personnel, and we may be unable to secure the services of consultants.\nAs of the date of this filing, our management team of five people is currently paid as consultants or independent contractors. We also have engaged and plan to continue to engage outside consultants called Senior Advisors to advise us and have been and will be required to retain additional consultants and employees. Our future performance will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate newly hired officers into our management team and our ability to develop an effective working relationship among senior management.\nCertain of our directors, officers, advisors, and consultants serve as officers, directors, advisors, or consultants of other companies that might be developing competitive products. Other than corporate opportunities, none of our directors are obligated under any agreement or understanding with us to make any additional products or technologies available to us. Similarly, we can give no assurances, and we do not expect, and stockholders should not expect, that any product or technology identified by any of our directors or affiliates in the future would be made available to us other than corporate opportunities. We can give no assurances that any such other companies will not have interests that are in conflict with its interests.\nLosing key personnel or failing to recruit necessary additional personnel would impede our ability to attain our development objectives. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the technology field, and we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel we need to develop our business.\nWe rely on independent organizations, advisors and consultants to perform certain services for us, including handling substantially all aspects of regulatory approval, manufacturing, marketing, and sales. We expect that this will continue to be the case. Such services may not always be available to us on a timely basis.\nWe may be subject to claims that our consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their other clients or former employers to us.\nAs is common in the technology industry, we engage the services of consultants to assist in the development of our products. Many of these consultants were previously employed at or may have previously been or are currently providing consulting services to other technology companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims that we or our consultants have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information about our former employers or their former or current customers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nMisappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position.\nOur success will depend to some extent upon our proprietary patented technology. The legal protections available to us can afford only limited protection, and these means of protecting our intellectual property may be inadequate. We rely, and will continue to rely, on patents, trademarks, trade secrets and copyright laws, confidentiality agreements, employment agreements, work for hire agreements, and technical measures to protect its intellectual property. We cannot ensure that the steps taken by it will prevent misappropriation of its technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which our products and services are made available online. Our intellectual property may be subject to even greater risk in foreign jurisdictions, as the laws of many countries do not protect intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States. As part of its confidentiality procedures, we generally will enter into agreements with its employees and consultants and limit access to our trade secrets and technology. We cannot assure or assume, however, that former employees will not seek to start or enhance other competing products or services to our detriment, our business, results of operations and financial condition. Nevertheless, management believes that the technical and creative skills of its personnel, continued development of its proprietary systems and technology, as well as brand name recognition and development are more essential in establishing and maintaining a competitive market position.\nDespite efforts to protect its proprietary rights, unauthorized persons may attempt to copy aspects of our products or services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of its proprietary rights is difficult and requires constant attention. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police its intellectual property rights. We may not be able to detect infringement and may lose its competitive position in the market before it is able to ascertain any such infringement. In addition, competitors may design around our proprietary technology or develop competing technologies.\nIntellectual property litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement by us. Other companies, including competitors, may obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell its products and services. Any such litigation by or against us, whether the claims are valid or not, could result in our incurring substantial costs and diversion of resources, including the attention of senior management. If we are unsuccessful in such legal proceedings, we could be subjected to significant damages; be required to license technology that is critical to our operations, if a license is available at a cost which we can pay; or be required to develop replacement technologies at substantial cost to us in money and time. Any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on patents and patent applications and various regulatory exclusivities to protect some of our product candidates, and our ability to compete may be limited or eliminated if we are not able to protect our products.\nThe patent positions of companies such as ours are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We may incur significant expenses in protecting our intellectual property and defending or assessing claims with respect to intellectual property owned by others. Any patent or other infringement litigation by or against us could cause us to incur significant expenses and divert the attention of our management.\nOthers may file patent applications or obtain patents on similar technologies that compete with our products or those of our joint ventures. We cannot predict how broad the claims in any such patents or applications will be and whether they will be allowed. Once claims have been issued, we cannot predict how they will be construed or enforced. We and/or our joint ventures may infringe upon intellectual property rights of others without being aware of it. If another party claims we are infringing their technology, we could have to defend an expensive and time-consuming lawsuit, pay a large sum if we are found to be infringing, or be prohibited from selling or licensing our products unless we obtain a license or redesign our products, which may not be possible.\nWe, and/or our joint ventures, also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to develop and maintain our, or our joint ventures, competitive position. Some of our current or former employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, current or prospective corporate collaborators, may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors or use our proprietary technology for their own benefits. Furthermore, enforcing a claim alleging the infringement of our trade secrets would be expensive and difficult to prove, making the outcome uncertain. Our competitors may also independently develop similar knowledge, methods, and know-how or gain access to our proprietary information through some other means.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights, as well as costs associated with lawsuits.\nIf any other person filed patent applications, or is issued patents, claiming technology also claimed by us, we may be required to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority and/or ownership of the invention. Our licensors or we may also need to participate in interference proceedings involving issued patents and pending applications of another entity.\nThe intellectual property environment in our industry is particularly complex, constantly evolving and highly fragmented. Other companies and institutions have issued patents and have filed or will file patent applications that may issue into patents that cover or attempt to cover products, processes or technologies similar to ours. We have not conducted freedom-to-use patent searches on all aspects of our product candidates or potential product candidates and may be unaware of relevant patents and patent applications of third parties. In addition, the freedom-to-use patent searches that have been conducted may not have identified all relevant issued patents or pending patent applications. We cannot provide assurance that our proposed products in this area will not ultimately be held to infringe one or more valid claims owned by third parties which may exist or come to exist in the future or that in such case we will be able to obtain a license from such parties on acceptable terms.\nWe cannot guarantee that our technologies will not conflict with the rights of others. In some foreign jurisdictions, we could become involved in opposition proceedings, either by opposing the validity of others foreign patents or by persons opposing the validity of our foreign patents.\nWe may also face frivolous litigation or lawsuits from various competitors or from litigious securities attorneys. The cost of any litigation or other proceeding relating to these areas, even if deemed frivolous or resolved in our favor, could be substantial and could distract management from its business. Uncertainties resulting from initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our operations.\nIf we infringe the rights of others, we could be prevented from selling products or forced to pay damages.\nIf our products, methods, processes, and other technologies are found to infringe the rights of other parties, we could be required to pay damages, or may be required to cease using the technology or to license rights from the prevailing party. Any prevailing party may be unwilling to offer us a license on commercially acceptable terms.\nWe cannot be certain we will be able to obtain patent protection to protect our product candidates and technology.\nWe cannot be certain that all patents applied for will be issued. If a third party has also filed a patent application relating to an invention claimed by us or one or more of our licensors, we may be required to participate in an interference or derivation proceeding declared or instituted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, which could result in substantial uncertainties and cost for us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. The degree of future patent protection for our product candidates and technology is uncertain. For example:\n\u25cf\nwe, or our licensors, might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by our issued patents, or pending or future patent applications;\n\u25cf\nwe, or our licensors, might not have been the first to file patent applications for the inventions;\n\u25cf\nothers may independently develop duplicative, similar or alternative technologies;\n\u25cf\nit is possible that our patent applications will not result in an issued patent or patents, or that the scope of protection granted by any patents arising from our patent applications will be significantly narrower than expected;\n\u25cf\nany patents under which we hold ultimate rights may not provide us with a basis for commercially viable products, may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties as not infringed, invalid, or unenforceable under United States or foreign laws;\n\u25cf\nany patent issued to us in the future or under which we hold rights may not be valid or enforceable; or\n\u25cf\nwe may develop additional technologies that are not patentable, and which may not be adequately protected through trade secrets; for example, if a competitor independently develops duplicative, similar, or alternative technologies.\nIn addition, disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including:\n\u25cf\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u25cf\nthe extent to which our technology, products, methods and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u25cf\nour diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those obligations;\n\u25cf\nif a third party expresses interest in an area under a license that we are not pursuing, under the certain terms of our license agreement, we may be required to sublicense rights in that area to the third party, and that sublicense could harm our business; and\n\u25cf\nthe ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us.\nIf disputes over the intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates.\nWe may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research to allow commercialization of our product candidates. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly.\nWe may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our product development efforts and stop us from commercializing or increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot guarantee that our products or product candidates, or manufacture or use of our products or product candidates, will not infringe third-party patents. Furthermore, a third party may claim that we are using inventions covered by the third partys patent rights and may go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, including making or selling our product candidates or products. These lawsuits are costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel. Some of these third parties may be better capitalized and have more resources than us. There is a risk that a court would decide that we are infringing the third partys patents and would order us to stop the activities covered by the patents. In that event, we may not have a viable way to get around the patent and may need to halt commercialization of the relevant product candidate(s) or product(s). In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us to pay the other party damages for having violated the other partys patents. In addition, we may be obligated to indemnify our licensors and collaborators against certain intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties, which could require us to expend additional resources. The aerospace and technology industries have produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform.\nIf we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods either do not infringe the claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert managements time and attention in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, which may not be available, and then we will have to defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patent in court. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming. We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. In addition, if we do not obtain a license, fail to develop or obtain non-infringing technology, fail to defend an infringement action successfully or have infringed patents declared invalid or unenforceable, we may incur substantial monetary damages, encounter significant delays in bringing our product candidates to market and be precluded from manufacturing or selling our product candidates.\nWe cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications, or that we were the first to invent the technology, because:\n\u25cf\nsome patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued;\n\u25cf\npatent applications in the United States are typically not published until 18 months after the priority date; and\n\u25cf\npublications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries.\nOur competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patent applications may have priority over our patent applications, which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed US patent applications on inventions similar to ours that claims priority to any applications filed prior to the priority dates of our applications, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared or a derivation proceed instituted by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful if, unbeknownst to us, the other party had independently arrived at the same or similar inventions prior to our own inventions, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions. Other countries have similar laws that permit secrecy of patent applications, and thus the third partys patent or patent application may be entitled to priority over our applications in such jurisdictions.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets.\nAs is common in the aerospace and technology industries, we may employ individuals who were previously employed at aerospace and technology companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail to defend any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we could lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nOur intellectual property may not be sufficient to protect our products from competition, which may negatively affect our business as well as limit our partnership or acquisition appeal.\nWe may be subject to competition despite the existence of intellectual property we license, or we or our joint ventures own. We can give no assurances that our intellectual property will be sufficient to prevent third parties from designing around the patents we own or license and developing and commercializing competitive products. The existence of competitive products that avoid our intellectual property could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, limitations, or perceived limitations, in our intellectual property may limit the interest of third parties to partner, collaborate or otherwise transact with us, if third parties perceive a higher than acceptable risk to commercialization of our products or future products.\nOur approach involves filing patent applications covering new methods of use and/or new formulations of previously known, studied and/or marketed devices. Although the protection afforded by patents issued from our patent applications may be significant, when looking at our patents ability to block competition, the protection offered by our patents may be, to some extent, more limited than the protection provided by patents claiming the composition of matter previously unknown. If a competitor were able to successfully design around any method of use and formulation patents we may have in the future, our business and competitive advantage could be significantly affected.\nWe may elect to sue a third party, or otherwise make a claim, alleging infringement or other violation of patents, trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, domain names or other intellectual property rights that we either own or license. If we do not prevail in enforcing our intellectual property rights in this type of litigation, we may be subject to:\n\u25cf\npaying monetary damages related to the legal expenses of the third party;\n\u25cf\nfacing additional competition that may have a significant adverse effect on our product pricing, market share, business operations, financial condition, and the commercial viability of our products; and\n\u25cf\nrestructuring our company or delaying or terminating select business opportunities, including, but not limited to, research and development, and commercialization activities, due to a potential deterioration of our financial condition or market competitiveness.\nA third party may also challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of the intellectual property rights that we license or own; and the result of these challenges may narrow the claim scope of or invalidate patents that are integral to our product candidates in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully defend patents we own or licensed in an action against third parties due to the unpredictability of litigation and the high costs associated with intellectual property litigation, amongst other factors.\nThe laws of some jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws or rules and regulations in the United States and Europe, and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in such jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in other jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated, rendered unenforceable or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. Furthermore, while we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in our expected significant markets, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our products or product candidates. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates in all of our expected significant foreign markets. If we or our licensors encounter difficulties in protecting, or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting, the intellectual property rights important for our business in such jurisdictions, the value of these rights may be diminished, and we may face additional competition from others in those jurisdictions.\nChanges to patent law, for example the Leahy-Smith America Invests Act, AIA or Leahy-Smith Act, of 2011 and the Patent Reform Act of 2009 and other future article of legislation in the U.S., may substantially change the regulations and procedures surrounding patent applications, issuance of patents, prosecution of patents, challenges to patent validity, and patent enforcement. We can give no assurances that our patents and those of our licensor(s) can be defended or will protect us against future intellectual property challenges, particularly as they pertain to changes in patent law and future patent law interpretations.\nIn addition, enforcing and maintaining our intellectual property protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and courts, and foreign government patent agencies and courts, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nIf we are not able to protect and control our unpatented trade secrets, know-how and other technological innovation, we may suffer competitive harm.\nWe also rely on proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how to protect our research and development activities, particularly when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or available. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We will attempt to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how by requiring our employees, consultants, collaborators, and advisors to execute a confidentiality and non-use agreement. We cannot guarantee that these agreements will provide meaningful protection, that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have an adequate remedy for any such breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or independently developed by a third party. Our trade secrets, and those of our present or future collaborators that we utilize by agreement, may become known or may be independently discovered by others, which could adversely affect the competitive position of our product candidates.\nWe may incur substantial costs enforcing our patents, defending against third-party patents, invalidating third-party patents or licensing third-party intellectual property, as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights.\nWe may be unaware of or unfamiliar with prior art and/or interpretations of prior art that could potentially impact the validity or scope of our patents, pending patent applications, or patent applications that we will file. We may have elected, or elect now or in the future, not to maintain or pursue intellectual property rights that, at some point in time, may be considered relevant to or enforceable against a competitor.\nWe take efforts and enter into agreements with employees, consultants, collaborators, and advisors to confirm ownership and chain of title in intellectual property rights. However, an inventorship or ownership dispute could arise that may permit one or more third parties to practice or enforce our intellectual property rights, including possible efforts to enforce rights against us.\nWe may not have rights under some patents or patent applications that may cover technologies that we use in our research, product candidates and particular uses thereof that we seek to develop and commercialize, as well as synthesis of our product candidates. Third parties may own or control these patents and patent applications in the United States and elsewhere. These third parties could bring claims against us or our collaborators that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators, we or they could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit. We or our collaborators therefore may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from the third-party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product or product candidate or forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, as a result of patent infringement claims, which could harm our business.\nThere has been substantial litigation and other legal proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the broad technology industry. Although we are not currently a party to any patent litigation or any other adversarial proceeding, including any interference or derivation proceeding declared or instituted before the United States Patent and Trademark Office, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products, product candidates and technology, it is possible that we may become so in the future. We are not currently aware of any actual or potential third-party infringement claim involving our product candidates. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. The outcome of patent litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance, including the demeanor and credibility of witnesses and the identity of the adverse party, especially in the aerospace and technology related patent cases that may turn on the testimony of experts as to technical facts upon which experts may reasonably disagree. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. If a patent or other proceeding is resolved against us, we may be enjoined from researching, developing, manufacturing or commercializing our products or product candidates without a license from the other party and we may be held liable for significant damages. We may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially acceptable terms or at all.\nUncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitors may develop and market products with similar features that may reduce demand for our potential products.\nThe following factors are important to our success:\n\u25cf\nreceiving patent protection for our product candidates;\n\u25cf\npreventing others from infringing our intellectual property rights; and\n\u25cf\nmaintaining our patent rights and trade secrets.\nWe will be able to protect our intellectual property rights in patents and trade secrets from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that such intellectual property rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.\nBecause issues of patentability involve complex legal and factual questions, the issuance, scope and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents may be challenged, invalidated, found unenforceable, or circumvented. United States patents and patent applications may be subject to interference and derivation proceedings, United States patents may also be subject to post grant proceedings, including re-examination, derivation, Inter Partes Review and Post Grant Review, in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and foreign patents may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in corresponding foreign patent offices, which could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. In addition, such interference, derivation, post grant and opposition proceedings may be costly. Thus, any patents that we own or license from others may not provide any protection against competitors. Furthermore, an adverse decision in an interference or derivation proceeding can result in a third-party receiving the patent rights sought by us, which in turn could affect our ability to market a potential product to which that patent filing was directed. Our pending patent applications, those that we may file in the future, or those that we may license from third parties may not result in patents being issued. If issued, they may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology that we have developed. Many countries, including certain countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. For example, compulsory licenses may be required in cases where the patent owner has failed to work the invention in that country, or the third-party has patented improvements. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of our patents. Moreover, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which makes it difficult to stop infringement.\nIn addition, our ability to enforce our patent rights depends on our ability to detect infringement. It is difficult to detect infringers who do not advertise or otherwise promote the compositions that are used in their products. Any litigation to enforce or defend our patent rights, even if we prevail, could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from business operations.\nWe will also rely on trade secrets, know-how and technology, which are not protected by patents, to maintain our competitive position. We will seek to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to it, such as strategic partners, collaborators, employees, contractors and consultants. Any of these parties may breach these agreements and disclose our confidential information or our competitors might learn of the information in some other way. If any trade secret, know-how or other technology not protected by a patent were disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNING OUR COMMON STOCK\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, capital requirements, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.\nIf we are unable to establish appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures, it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, result in the restatement of our financial statements, harm our operating results, subject us to regulatory scrutiny and sanction, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the market price for shares of our Common Stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. We maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, which is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nAs a public company, we have significant additional requirements for enhanced financial reporting and internal controls. We are required to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. The process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company.\nWe cannot assure you that we will, in the future, identify areas requiring improvement in our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot assure you that the measures we will take to remediate any areas in need of improvement will be successful or that we will implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future as we continue our growth. If we are unable to establish appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures, it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, result in the restatement of our financial statements, harm our operating results, subject us to regulatory scrutiny and sanction, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the market price for shares of our Common Stock.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially.\nOur stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for companies with smaller public floats in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, our stockholders may not be able to sell our common stock at or above the price they paid for it. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe timing, results and capacity of our manufacturing operations;\n\u00b7\nthe success of existing or new competitive products or technologies;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nestablishment or termination of collaboration of our joint ventures or development programs;\n\u00b7\nfailure of discontinuation of any of our development programs;\n\u00b7\nthe success of our competitors new products entering the marketplace;\n\u00b7\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or development programs;\n\u00b7\nthe results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or license additional products;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results or production and development timelines;\n\u00b7\nannouncement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u00b7\nsales of our common stock by us, our insiders or other stockholders;\n\u00b7\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived similar to us;\n\u00b7\nchanges in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, that cover our stock;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u00b7\nthe other factors described in the Risk Factors sections of our Form 10-K for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022 and in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended September 30, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, and in subsequent filings, which are incorporated by reference into this registration statement.\nOur directors and executive officers can exert significant control over our business and affairs and have actual or potential interests that may depart from those of investors in the subsequent financings.\nThe interests of our directors and officers may differ from the interests of our other stockholders, including purchasers of our securities, in future financings. As a result, based on their board seats and offices, such persons will have significant influence over and control all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, irrespective of how the Companys other stockholders, may vote, including the following actions:\n\u25cf\nto elect or defeat the election of our directors;\n\u25cf\nto amend or prevent amendment of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or By-laws;\n\u25cf\nto effect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and\n\u25cf\nto control the outcome of any other matter submitted to our stockholders for vote.\nThis concentration of ownership by itself may have the effect of impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business consolidation, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for the Common Stock which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nWe may issue more shares in a future financing or pursuant to existing agreements which will result in substantial dilution.\nOur Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of a maximum of 5,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock and a maximum of 100,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock. Any future merger or acquisition effected by us would result in the issuance of additional securities without stockholder approval and the substantial dilution in the percentage of our Common Stock held by our then existing stockholders. Moreover, the Common Stock issued in any such merger or acquisition transaction may be valued on an arbitrary or non-arms-length basis by our management, resulting in an additional reduction in the percentage of Common Stock held by our then existing stockholders. Additionally, we expect to seek additional financing in order to provide working capital to the operating business. Our Board of Directors has the power to issue any or all of such authorized but unissued shares without stockholder approval. To the extent that additional shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock are issued in connection with and following a business combination or otherwise, dilution to the interests of our stockholders will occur and the rights of the holders of Common Stock might be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Board of Directors is authorized to issue Preferred Stock without obtaining shareholder approval.\nOur Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue Preferred Stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting, or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the Common Stock. In the event of issuance, the Preferred Stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of Preferred Stock, there can be no assurance that the Company will not do so in the future.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not develop, and you may not be able to sell your common stock.\nThere has been a limited public market for our common stock. An active trading market for shares of our common stock may never develop or be sustained following this offering. If an active trading market does not develop, you may have difficulty selling your shares of common stock at an attractive price, or at all. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling our common stock, and it may impair our ability to attract and motivate our employees through equity incentive awards and our ability to acquire other companies, products or technologies by using our common stock as consideration.\nMarket and economic conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition and share price.\nConcerns over medical epidemics, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the U.S. mortgage market and a deteriorating real estate market, unstable global credit markets and financial conditions, and volatile oil prices have led to periods of significant economic instability, diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence and discretionary spending, diminished expectations for the global economy and expectations of slower global economic growth, increased unemployment rates, and increased credit defaults in recent years. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturns (such as the recent downturn related to the COVID-19 pandemic), volatile business environments and continued unstable or unpredictable economic, market, and geopolitical conditions, such as the current situation in the Ukraine. If these conditions continue to deteriorate or do not improve, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to complete, more costly, and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance, and share price and could require us to delay or abandon development or commercialization plans.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our share price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, including increased marketing, hiring new personnel, commercializing our product, and continuing activities as an operating public company. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our shares of common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our shares.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, of our share price.\nWe may be at risk of securities class action litigation.\nWe may be at risk of securities class action litigation. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources, which could harm our business and result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nOur Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws, and Nevada law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws, and Nevada law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if closing such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders. We are authorized to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock. This preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by our Board of Directors without further action by stockholders. The terms of any series of preferred stock may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividend, liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. The issuance of any preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock, and therefore, reduce the value of our common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell our assets to, a third party and thereby preserve control by the present management.\nProvisions of our Articles of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws and Nevada law also could have the effect of discouraging potential acquisition proposals or making a tender offer or delaying or preventing a change in control, including changes a stockholder might consider favorable. Such provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. In particular, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Nevada law, as applicable, among other things:\n\u25cf\nprovide the board of directors with the ability to alter the bylaws without stockholder approval;\n\u25cf\nplace limitations on the removal of directors;\n\u25cf\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings; and\n\u25cf\nprovide that vacancies on the board of directors may be filled by a majority of directors in office, although less than a quorum.\nFinancial reporting obligations of being a public company in the U.S. are expensive and time-consuming, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance matters.\nAs a publicly traded company we incur significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses. The obligations of being a public company in the U.S. require significant expenditures and will place significant demands on our management and other personnel, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations regarding corporate governance practices, including those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the listing requirements of the stock exchange on which our securities are listed. These rules require the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and procedures, internal control over financial reporting and changes in corporate governance practices, among many other complex rules that are often difficult to implement, monitor and maintain compliance with. Moreover, despite recent reforms made possible by the JOBS Act, the reporting requirements, rules, and regulations will make some activities more time-consuming. In addition, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements and to keep pace with new regulations, otherwise we may fall out of compliance and risk becoming subject to litigation or being delisted, among other potential problems.\nThere will be a substantial number of common shares eligible for future sale from the conversion of Series A Preferred shares.\nThere were 757,395 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock outstanding as of June 30, 2023. Each preferred share is convertible into 1,000 common shares. Once converted, these shares are eligible for resale under Rule 144. The sale, or availability for sale, of the foregoing shares could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of our common stock.  Item 2. Properties\nThe Companys headquarters consists of 2,911 square feet of leased office space located in the Research Park at Florida Atlantic University, Innovation Centre 1, 3998 FAU Blvd., Suite 309 Boca Raton, FL 33431. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nOn September 1, 2021, Xeriant Inc. brought a cause of action in the Southern District of Florida against a former shareholder for claims, including but not limited to, breach of contract, misrepresentation, and asserting claims to recoup monetary and in-kind distributions made to the shareholder by the Company. The defendant submitted an affirmative defense and counterclaim on October 29, 2021, which was subsequently dismissed.\nThere is no pending litigation against the Company and to our knowledge no litigation is contemplated or threatened. To our knowledge, none of our directors, officers, 5% shareholders or affiliates are party to any legal proceedings that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot Applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is quoted on OTC Markets under the symbol XERI.\nShares of our common stock have historically been thinly traded, and as a result, our stock price as quoted by OTC Markets may not reflect an actual or perceived value. The following table sets forth the approximate high and low bid prices for our common stock for the last two fiscal years and interim periods. The quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not represent actual transactions.\nPeriod\nHigh Bid\nLow Bid\nJuly 1, 2022, through September 30, 2022\n$ 0.089\n$ 0.031\nOctober 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022\n$ 0.053\n$ 0.024\nJanuary 1, 2023, through March 31, 2023\n$ 0.054\n$ 0.021\nApril 1, 2023, through June 30, 2023\n$ 0.031\n$ 0.017\nPeriod\nHigh Bid\nLow Bid\nJuly 1, 2021, through September 30, 2021\n$ 0.240\n$ 0.143\nOctober 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021\n$ 0.171\n$ 0.061\nJanuary 1, 2022, through March 31, 2022\n$ 0.214\n$ 0.080\nApril 1, 2022, through June 30, 2022\n$ 0.119\n$ 0.065\nOur Transfer Agent\nOlde Monmouth Stock Transfer Company, with offices at 200 Memorial Parkway, Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey 07716, is the transfer agent for our shares of common stock. The transfer agent is responsible for all record-keeping and administrative functions in connection with our shares of common stock.\nHolders\nAs of June 30, 2023, there were 194 holders of record of our common stock.\nDividends\nWe have not declared any cash dividends, nor do we intend to do so in the foreseeable future.\nPenny Stock Regulations\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called penny stocks to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. The Registrants common stock is a penny stock and is subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the Penny Stock Rule. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual incomes exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouses). For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market, thus possibly making it more difficult for us to raise additional capital.\nFor any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in penny stock, of a disclosure schedule required by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock.\nThere can be no assurance that the Registrants common stock will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. Even if the Registrants common stock were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, the Registrant would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nThe Registrant does not have any equity compensation plans and accordingly there are no shares authorized for issuance under an equity compensation plan. Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\nNot applicable because we are a smaller reporting company. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Report.

We seek to partner with and acquire strategic interests in visionary companies that accelerate this mission. The Company is located at the Research Park at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida.\nJoint Venture with XTI Aircraft\nOn May 31, 2021, we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the Agreement) with XTI Aircraft Company (XTI), a Delaware corporation, to form the XTI JV, named Eco-Aero, LLC, with the purpose of completing the preliminary design review (PDR) of XTIs TriFan 600, a 5-passenger plus pilot, hybrid electric, vertical takeoff, and landing (eVTOL) fixed wing aircraft. Under the Agreement, Xeriant is contributing capital, technology, and strategic business relationships, and XTI is contributing intellectual property licensing rights and know-how. XTI and the Company each own 50 percent of the XTI JV, and it is managed by a management committee consisting of five members, three appointed by Xeriant and two by XTI. The Agreement was effective on June 4, 2021, with an initial deposit of USD1 million into the XTI JV. Our financial commitment was up to USD10 million, contributed as needed to complete the preliminary design of the aircraft. XTI completed Preliminary Design Review during the first quarter of 2022, which was the purpose of the XTI JV.\nOn May 17, 2022, we executed a confidential Letter Agreement with XTI, the material terms of which are briefly delineated as follows:\nXeriant would be entitled to compensation for its role in introducing XTI to Inpixon, a Nasdaq-listed company, contingent upon the occurrence of any merger, combination, or transactional event between XTI and Inpixon.\nXTI would assume the financial obligations related to the Senior Secured Note with Auctus Fund, LLC, including the $6.05 million principal balance of the note and warrant obligations. Additionally, Xeriant was to be granted a fully diluted equity interest amounting to 6% in XTI, issued immediately prior to any prospective combination with Inpixon.\nOn June 5, 2023, after suspecting that the obligations under the Letter Agreement were possibly being evaded, we transmitted a formal demand letter to XTI requesting compliance with the provisions outlined in the Letter Agreement and in accordance with Section 8 of the JV Agreement with XTI.\nOn July 25, 2023, Inpixon publicly disclosed the execution of a definitive merger agreement with XTI in the 8-K filing, confirming our suspicions. We learned in that filing that XTI was funded $300,000 by Inpixon on March 10, 2023, followed by additional fundings aggregating, at the time of Inpixons July 25, 2023, 8-k filing, to $525,000 under a $2,313,407 Senior Secured Promissory Note from Inpixon to fund XTI. We believe this transaction is covered under the Letter Agreement as a trigger for compensation due to Xeriant as outlined above.\nWe also found out that, as a condition of closing of the merger with Inpixon, XTIs obligations to Xeriant would need to be settled. The July 25, 2023, Inpixon 8-K, Exhibit 2-1 - the Agreement of Plan and Merger, Section 8(g) - Conditions Precede-t - page 67 states The Company [XTI], Parent and their respective successors, assigns and Affiliates shall have received an unconditional full release of claims from Xeriant and its Affiliates in form and substance acceptable to Parent and the Company.\nThe chronology of key meetings and events disclosed in the Inpixon and XTI S-4/A filing of October 6, 2023, discloses that discussions between Inpixon and XTI started May 18, 2022, one day after the Letter Agreement was executed between Xeriant and XTI. That meeting included Mr. Ali, CEO of Inpixon, and Mr. LaBelle, CEO of XTI.\nDue to the disclosures in the XTI and Inpixon filings, we believe Xeriant is entitled to the compensation provided in its Letter Agreement with XTI.\nIn Inpixons July 25, 2023, 8-K, Exhibit 99.5 - Unaudited financial statements of XTI Aircraft Company as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023, note 8, page 19, XTI states that it believes it has no obligation to Xeriant under the May 17, 2022 letter agreement and intends to vigorously defend any litigation filed.\nUnder the XTI JV Operating Agreement, under Management Committee, section 5.1I requires approval of all of the members of the Management Committee for determination of a Liquidity Event, Acceleration Event or Completion Event as defined in the JV Agreement. This approval has not been obtained by XTI. In addition, section 10.3 specifies the procedures regarding liquidation of the XTI JV, which are to be directed unanimously by the Management Committee. Section 11.3, under Equitable Remedies, the breach of any obligations by one of the parties shall be entitled to equitable relief, including a temporary restraining order, and injunction, specific performance and any other relief that may be available from a court of competent jurisdiction (without and requirement to post bond).\nThe Joint Venture Agreement, under section-8 - Dispute Resolution outlines the procedures to follow in the event of dispute between the parties. Xeriant has followed sections 8.1 and 8.2 regarding notice given and attempts to resolve the dispute between executive management. Non-binding mediation is the next step provided in the JV Agreement, followed by arbitration. These procedures need to be followed by Xeriant and XTI.\nSection 10 of the JV Agreement, under Assignability of a Partys Interest, states that no party shall, without the prior written consent of the majority of the members of the Management Committee including at least one member from each Party (which consent may be withheld for any reason) sell, transfer, assign, hypothecate or make a gift of all or any portion of such Partys interest in the JV. Xeriant has not provided its consent through the Management Committee to XTIs pending transfer of interest to Inpixon nor to any transfer of the intellectual property created in the XTI JV, including but not limited to the VTOL technology as defined in the JV Agreement. In the Security and Pledge Agreement between XTI and Inpixon, XTI pledged all of its assets to Inpixon in connection with its Senior Secured Note with Inpixon in violation of the XTI JVs Operating Agreement and JV Agreement with Xeriant.\nDue to the disclosures in the XTI and Inpixon filings, we believe Xeriant is entitled to the compensation provided in its Letter Agreement with XTI. XTI and Inpixon are disputing the fact that the Letter Agreement gives rise to compensation to the Company. As of the date of this filing, we remain engaged in dialogue with XTI to enforce compliance with the Letter Agreement and to find an amicable resolution, although no assurance can be given that such a resolution will be achieved.\nRecent Developments\nJoint Venture with Movychem\nOn April 2, 2022, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with Movychem s.r.o., a Slovakian limited liability company, to develop and commercialize a flame-retardant called Retacell\u00ae. The Joint Venture is organized as a Florida limited liability company under the name Ebenberg, LLC, owned 50% by each of the Company and Movychem.\nFor its capital contribution to the Joint Venture, pursuant to a Patent and Exclusive License and Assignment Agreement (the Patent Agreement), Movychem would transfer to the Joint Venture all of its interest to the know-how and intellectual property relating to Retacell exclusive of all patents, and the Company would contribute the amount of $2,600,000 payable (a) $600,000 at the rate of $25,000 per month over a 24-month period and (b) $2,000,000 within five (5) business days of a closing of a financing in which the Company receives net proceeds of at least $3,000,000, but in no event later than six months from the Effective Date. At such time as the Company makes a $2,000,000 payment (and assuming the Company is current with its then monthly capital contributions), pursuant to the Patent Agreement, Movychem would transfer all of its rights, title and interest to all of the patents related to Retacell for an amount equal to aggregate cash contributions of the Company to the Joint Venture plus 40% of all royalty payments received by the Joint Venture for the licensing of Retacell products. Pending assignment of the patents to the Joint Venture, pursuant to the Patent Agreement, Movychem would grant to the Joint Venture an exclusive worldwide license under the patents.\nUnder the Joint Venture Agreement, the Company had agreed to grant to certain individuals affiliated with Movychem five-year warrants (the Warrants) to purchase an aggregate of 170,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share with vesting depending on the satisfaction of various milestones as described therein.\nThe Joint Venture Agreement granted to Movychem the right to dissolve the Joint Venture in the event that the Company fails to make any of its capital contributions in which case the Joint Venture will be required to grant back to Movychem all joint venture intellectual property and the assignment to Movychem of any outstanding licenses. After working with Movychem over the past year and experiencing a number of issues, including but not limited to Movychems unwillingness to provide material documentation, processes and information required for the exploitation of Retacell\u00ae, the Company has independently developed an upcycled construction panel, without the inclusion of Retacell\u00ae, outside of the Movychem JV. This approach will enable us to unlock existing demand indicated by several homebuilders and developers for industrial scale production of environmentally friendly construction panels in varying thicknesses and sizes, including standard 48 x 96 sheets.\nThe Company analyzed the transaction under ASC 810 Consolidation, to determine if the joint venture classifies as a Variable Interest Entity (VIE). The Joint Venture qualifies as a VIE based on the fact the JV does not have sufficient equity to operate without financial support from both parties. According to ASC 810-25-38, a reporting entity shall consolidate a VIE when that reporting entity has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) that provides the reporting entity with a controlling financial interest on the basis of the provisions in paragraphs 810-10-25-38A through 25-38J. The reporting entity that consolidates a VIE is called the primary beneficiary of that VIE. According to the JV operating agreement, the ownership interests are 50/50 and the agreement provides for a Management Committee of five members. Two of the five members are from Xeriant and Movychem, respectively and one is appointed by mutual agreement of the parties. Movychem is transferring to the Joint Venture all of its interest to the know-how and intellectual property relating to Retacell exclusive of all patents, and the Company is contributing cash. As such, both parties do not have substantial capital at risk. Based on these two factors, the conclusion is that no one is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, Xeriant has not consolidated the VIE.\nBecause of Movychems non-performance as described above, Xeriant ceased paying Movychem $25,000 per month as required in the Joint Venture beginning December 2022. On February 13, 2023, Movychem formally requested dissolution of its Joint Venture with Xeriant, named Ebenberg, LLC. On February 24, 2023, Xeriant provided a formal response to Movychem highlighting its multiple and sustained lapses in collaborative efforts related to the commercialization of the Retacell technology. Subsequent to this communication, Xeriant expressly repudiated Movychems proposition for dissolution and their proposition to take an exclusive territory to market Retacell\u00ae. Because Xeriant is focused on the commercialization and industrial-level production of the eco-friendly composite construction panels, and has moved beyond the Retacell\u00ae technology, the Company agreed to dissolution of the Ebenberg, LLC Joint Venture effective June 30, 2023. As such, the accumulated Investment in Ebenberg JV as of June 30, 2023, of $156,460 was fully impaired as of that date and reported as Loss on Impairment of Investment.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company had paid $312,919 to the Joint Venture.\nStock Sales\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company received $0 by selling shares common stock.\nConvertible Notes Issued\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company received $370,000 from issuance of convertible debt.\nLitigation\nOn September 1, 2021, Xeriant Inc. brought a cause of action in the Southern District of Florida against a former shareholder for claims, including but not limited to, breach of contract, misrepresentation, and asserting claims to recoup monetary and in-kind distributions made to the shareholder by the Company. The defendant submitted an affirmative defense and counterclaim on October 29, 2021, which was subsequently dismissed.\nFiscal Year 2023 Results of Operations Compared with Fiscal Year 2022\nFor the years ended\nJune 30, 2023\nJune 30, 2022\n$\nOperating expenses:\nConsulting and advisory fees\n$ 1,101,573\n$ 3,031,959\n$ (1,930,386 )\nRelated party consulting fees\n353,000\n432,425\n(79,425 )\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n302,693\n1,184,654\n(881,961 )\nProfessional fees\n271,021\n444,012\n(172,991 )\nAdvertising and marketing expense\n23,348\n651,567\n(628,219 )\nResearch and development expense\n-\n5,267,581\n(5,267,581 )\nTotal operating expenses\n2,051,635\n11,012,198\n(8,960,563 )\nOperating loss\n(2,051,635 )\n(11,012,198 )\n8,960,563\nOther expenses:\nAmortization of debt discount\n(461,842 )\n(4,629,089 )\n4,167,247\nFinancing fees\n-\n(43,750 )\n43,750\nInterest expense\n(10,566 )\n(138,944 )\n128,378\nDecrease (increase) in fair value of convertible bridge loans\n(57,368 )\n-\n(57,368 )\nLoss on impairment of investment\n(156,460 )\n-\n(156,460 )\nLoss from Ebenberg JV\n(98,781 )\n(57,678 )\n(41,103 )\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n(4,259,987 )\n(536 )\n(4,259,451 )\nTotal other (expense)\n(5,045,004 )\n(4,869,997 )\n(175,007 )\nNet loss\n$ (7,096,639 )\n$ (15,882,195 )\n$ 8,785,556\nConsulting and advisory fees\nTotal consulting and advisory expenses were $1,101,573 and $3,031,959 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In the prior period, there were increased expenses due to stock issuances.\nRelated Party Consulting Fees\nTotal related party consulting fees were $353,000 and $432,425 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The related party consulting fees for the year ended June 30, 2023, consisted of (i) $170,000 to Ancient Investments, LLC, a company owned by Keith Duffy, CEO and Scott Duffy, Executive Director of Operations, (ii) $56,000 for AMP Web Services, LLC, a company owned by Pablo Lavigna, CIO, (iii) $102,000 to Edward DeFeudis, Director, and (iv) $25,000 for Keystone Business Development Partners, LLC, a company owned by Brian Carey, CFO.

The prior period increased amount was due to legal fees relating to increased JV activity.\nAdvertising and marketing expenses\nTotal advertising and marketing expenses were $23,348 and $651,567 for the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively. During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Companys advertising and marketing expenses were associated with social media marketing campaigns, events and press releases that were not continued in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nTotal research and development expenses were $0 and $5,267,581 for the years ended June 30 2023, and 2022, respectively. The research and development expenses in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, were in connection with our Eco-Aero, LLC joint venture with XTI Aircraft Company for funding the preliminary design phase in the development of an aircraft, called the TriFan 600. There were no expenses for the joint venture for the year ended June 30, 2023. Research & Development Expenses relating to Movychem/Ebenberg JV are accounted for through Ebenberg, LLC.\nOther (Expenses)\nTotal other expenses consist of amortization of debt discount related to convertible notes, interest expense related to convertible notes, change in fair value of the convertible bridge loans, loss on impairment of investment, loss from Ebenberg JV and loss on extinguishment of debt. Total other expenses were $5,045,004 for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to $4,869,997 for the year ended June 30, 2022. The increase was primarily due to recording the loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended June 30, 2023, in the amount of $4,259,987.\nNet loss\nTotal net loss was $7,096,639 for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to $15,882,195 for the year ended June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily related to amortization of debt discount of $4,629,089 and $5,267,581 of research and development expenses in the prior period versus $0 of research and development expenses and $461,842 of amortization of debt discount in the current period. The difference was partially offset by the loss on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $4,259,987 for the current period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared using the generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. On June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $61,625 and $1,065,945 in cash, respectfully, and $6,684,867 and $3,072,483 in negative working capital, respectively. On June 30, 2023, the principal balance of the Auctus Senior Secured Promissory Note was $5,850,000 including accrued liability of $50,000. The Note matured on March 15, 2023, and the company has been in discussions with Auctus to resolve the liability. For the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had a net loss of $7,096,639 and $15,882,195, respectively. Continued losses may adversely affect the liquidity of the Company in the future. Therefore, the factors noted above raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent upon the Companys ability to raise additional capital, obtain financing and to succeed in its future operations. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Companys existence is dependent upon managements ability to develop profitable operations and resolve its liquidity problems.\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, our operating activities used $1,174,190 of net cash used compared to using $6,927,249 of net cash used in our operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. This difference primarily related to a decrease in stock-based compensation and stock issued for services and amortization of debt discount and offset by increase in loss on extinguishment of debt in fiscal year 2023. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, our investing activities used $200,130 of net cash compared to using $135,346 of net cash used in our investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. This difference related to an increase in investment in Movychem JV and offset by decrease in purchase of property and equipment in fiscal year 2023. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, our financing activities added $370,000 of net cash compared to adding $7,166,000 of net cash in our financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. This difference related to a substantial decrease in the issuance of convertible notes and no sales of stock or cash from exercise of warrants in fiscal year 2023.\nFunding Strategy\nTo date, our operations have been funded primarily through private investors. Some of these investors have verbally committed additional funding for the Company, as needed. We have had a number of discussions with broker-dealers regarding the funding required to execute the Companys business plan, which is to acquire and develop breakthrough technologies or business interests in those companies that have developed these technologies. We plan on issuing an offering document to obtain funding for certain acquisitions that are in the discussion stages.\nOff Balance Sheet Items\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as special purpose entities (SPEs).\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments which affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities (see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, contained in the notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 contained in this filing). On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates based upon different assumptions or conditions; however, we believe that our estimates are reasonable.\nManagement is aware that certain changes in accounting estimates employed in generating financial statements can have the effect of making the Company look more or less profitable than it actually is. Management does not believe that the Company has made any such changes in accounting estimates.  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nXERIANT, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2023 and 2022\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID # 3289)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the Years Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders Deficit for the Years Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Xeriant, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Xeriant, Inc. (the Company) as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nSubstantial Doubt about the Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2, the Company has incurred net losses and negative cash flow from operations since inception. These factors, and the need for additional financing in order for the Company to meet its business plans raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nDerivatives\nAs described in Note 2 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, during the year ended June 30, 2022, prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, when the Company issues debt that contains a conversion feature that provided for a rate of conversion that is below market value at issuance, this feature was characterized as a 3001 N. Rocky Point Dr. East, Suite 200 i Tampa, Florida 33607 i 813.367.3527 beneficial conversion feature and recorded as a debt discount pursuant to ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. When the Company issues debt that contains a warrant feature, the Company estimates and records the fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Also, as discussed in Note 12 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluates warrants issued through debt under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, to determine if they require liability classification.\nWe identified the Companys application of the accounting for convertible notes and debt modification as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination of this critical audit matter related to the high degree of subjectivity in the Companys judgments in determining the qualitative factors. Auditing these judgments and assumptions by the Company involves auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address these matters.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address these critical audit matters included the following:\n\u00b7\nWe obtained debt and warrant related agreements and performed the following procedures:\n-\nReviewed agreements for all relevant terms.\n-\nTested managements identification and treatment of agreement terms.\n-\nRecalculated managements fair value based on the terms in the agreements.\n-\nAssessed the terms and evaluated the appropriateness of managements application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of the amortization of the debt discount.\nStock-Based Compensation\nAs described in Note 2 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, the Company measures the cost of employee services rendered in exchange for equity incentive awards based on the grant date fair value of the award. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock options granted to employees or consultants. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, which is usually the vesting period.\nWe identified the Companys application of equity incentive awards as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination of this critical audit matter related to the high degree of subjectivity in the Companys judgments in determining the qualitative factors. Auditing these judgments and assumptions by the Company involves auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address these matters.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address these critical audit matters included the following:\n\u00b7\nWe obtained related agreements and performed the following procedures:\n-\nReviewed agreements for all relevant terms.\n-\nTested managements identification and treatment of agreement terms.\n-\nRecalculated managements fair value based on the terms in the agreements.\n-\nAssessed the terms and evaluated the appropriateness of managements application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of the amortization of the debt discount.\nVariable Interest Entities\nAs described in Note 3 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, the Company analyzes investment transactions under ASC 810, Consolidation, to determine if the transaction classifies as a variable interest entity (VIE). According to ASC 810-25-38, a reporting entity shall consolidate a VIE when that reporting entity has a variable interest that provides the reporting entity with a controlling financial interest on the basis of the provisions in paragraphs 810-10-25-38A - 25-38J. The reporting entity that consolidates a VIE is called the primary beneficiary of that VIE.\nWe identified the Companys accounting for its investments and determination of whether a VIE exists as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination of this critical audit matter related to the significant risks associated with the proper accounting for these transactions, as well as the nature and extent of audit effort required to address the matter.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address these critical audit matters included the following:\n\u00b7\nWe obtained and reviewed all relevant agreements and documents associated with the joint ventures.\n\u00b7\nWe obtained managements analysis on the accounting for the joint ventures and the determination of whether these were VIEs that should be consolidated and performed the following procedures:\n-\nReviewed the analysis.\n-\nTested supporting documentation related to managements conclusion of whether the joint venture was a VIE that should be consolidated.\n-\nEvaluated the appropriateness of managements application of their accounting policies in the determination that any VIEs identified were properly consolidated.\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2023.\nTampa, Florida\nOctober 15, 2023\nPCAOB ID# 3289\nXERIANT, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAs of\nAs of\nJune 30, 2023\nJune 30, 2022\nAssets\nCurrent assets\nCash\n$ 61,625\n$ 1,065,945\nPrepaids\n4,529\nTotal current assets\n66,154\n1,066,701\nDeposits\n12,546\n12,546\nProperty & equipment, net\n5,507\n4,409\nOperating lease right-of-use asset\n82,911\n128,342\nInvestment in JV with Ebenberg LLC\n-\n57,678\nTotal assets\n$ 167,118\n$ 1,269,676\nLiabilities and stockholders' deficit\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\n$ 402,568\n$ 56,836\nAccrued liabilities, related party\n20,000\n22,000\nShares to be issued\n75,200\n75,200\nConvertible notes payable, net of discount -

ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS\nCompany Overview\nXeriant, Inc. (the Company) is dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of advanced materials and technology related to next generation air and spacecraft, which can be successfully integrated and commercialized for deployment across multiple industrial sectors. The Company seeks to partner with and acquire strategic interests in visionary companies that accelerate this mission. Xeriants advanced materials line is marketed under the DUREVER\u2122 brand, and includes NexBoard\u2122, an eco-friendly, patent-pending composite building panel made from plastic and cellulose waste, designed to replace products such as drywall, plywood, OSB, MDF, MgO board and other materials used in construction.\nOperating History\nThe Company is a development-stage enterprise with a limited operating history with no sales, and operating losses since its inception. The Company has had two joint ventures, one in the area of aerospace that was effective May 27, 2021, and the other involving advanced materials that was effective April 2, 2022, and terminated June 30, 2023.\nAdvanced Materials\nA primary focus of the Company is the acquisition and commercial exploitation of eco-friendly, advanced materials and chemicals which have applications across a broad range of industries and the potential to generate significant near-term revenue. The Companys commercialization strategy encompasses licensing arrangements and joint ventures, which would allow for more rapid access to the market with reduced capital requirements and financial risk. In addition to providing the production and distribution infrastructure, these established partnering companies can streamline testing and certification and add brand recognition value. The advanced materials and chemicals may be sold as standalone products, enhancements to existing products, or used in the development of proprietary products under a new trademarked brand owned by the Company. The Company is exploring manufacturing and branding opportunities for specific products derived from advanced materials and chemicals acquired or developed, which would involve setting up production facilities, equipment, systems and supply chain.\nEffective April 2, 2022, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with Movychem s.r.o, a Slovakian chemical company, setting forth the terms for a joint venture (referred to herein as the Movychem JV) to exploit the Movychem Intellectual Property and Purchased Patents. The Movychem JV, owned 50% by Xeriant and 50% by Movychem, subject to certain funding conditions, was granted the exclusive worldwide rights to the intellectual property related to Retacell\u00ae, an industrial flame-retardant, and would be responsible for developing applications and commercializing products.\nOn June 8, 2022, Xeriant announced the development of a multi-purpose, high-strength fire- and water-resistant composite panel made from a formulation of Retacell\u00ae and a cardboard fiber-reinforced polymeric resin. The panel described in the press release was initially produced in a benchtop setting.\nAfter experiencing a number of issues, including but not limited to Movychems unwillingness to provide material documentation, processes and information required for the exploitation of Retacell\u00ae, the Company independently developed an upcycled construction panel, without the inclusion of Retacell\u00ae, outside of the Movychem JV.\nOn July 11, 2023, Xeriant announced the successful testing of a proprietary high-volume production process for an environmentally friendly patent-pending composite construction panel (NexBoard) that can be produced in the United States at industrial scale. This approach will enable the Company to unlock existing demand indicated by several homebuilders and developers seeking environmentally friendly construction panels in varying thicknesses and sizes, including standard 48 x 96 sheets, economically and with consistency and efficiency.\nOn August 12, 2022, the Company filed the trademark NexBoard, for construction panels, namely, composite sheets and panels composed primarily of plastic, reinforcement materials and fire-retardant chemicals for use in walls, ceilings, flooring, framing, siding, roofing and decking. The trademark filing was intentionally broad and based upon demand for a general all-purpose construction panel made from a mixture of fire-retardant and recycled materials.\nBecause of Movychems non-performance, as described above, Xeriant ceased paying Movychem $25,000 per month as required in the Joint Venture beginning December 2022. On February 13, 2023, Movychem formally requested dissolution of its Joint Venture with Xeriant, Ebenberg, LLC. On February 24, 2023, Xeriant provided a formal response to Movychem, highlighting its multiple and sustained lapses in collaborative efforts related to the commercialization of the Retacell\u00ae technology. Subsequent to this communication, Xeriant expressly repudiated Movychems proposition for dissolution and their proposition to take an exclusive territory to market Retacell\u00ae. Because Xeriant is focused on the commercialization and industrial-level production of eco-friendly composite construction panels, and has moved past the Retacell\u00ae technology, the Company agreed to dissolution of the Ebenberg, LLC Joint Venture effective June 30, 2023.\nOn March 31, 2023, the Company filed a provisional patent application titled Multilayered Fire-Resistant Polymer Composite and Method for Producing Same, for a method of producing a unique fire-resistant thermoplastic and fiber composite material which may be formed or shaped into various construction products of different thicknesses and dimensions. This green material will be composed primarily of recycled plastic, cellulose and ecofriendly fire-retardant chemicals, including but not limited to use in walls, ceilings, flooring, framing, siding, roofing, molding, and decking, used in construction. Subject to available capital, the Company is planning to build manufacturing facilities in the United States for the production of NexBoard in order to meet market demand, or alternatively license the technology and process. The Company has identified potential sites for near-term contract manufacturing, a pilot plant, and larger manufacturing facilities, received bids for specialized manufacturing equipment, developed timetables related to the action plan, and hired a managing director with decades of experience to oversee the projects.\nAerospace\nAnother area of interest for the Company is the emerging aviation market called Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), the transition to more efficient, eco-friendly, automated and convenient flight operations enabled by the convergence of technological advancements in design and engineering, composite materials, propulsion systems, battery energy density and manufacturing processes. Next-generation aircraft being developed for this market offer low-cost, on-demand flight for passengers and cargo, utilizing lower altitude airspace and bypassing the traditional hub and spoke airport network with vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities. Many of these lightweight aircraft are electrically powered through either hybrid or pure battery systems, which allows for quieter, low emission flights over urban areas, however with limited speed and range. The adoption and integration of niche aerial services through AAM is expected to provide benefits throughout the economy. The Company plans to partner with and acquire strategic interests in visionary companies that accelerate our mission of commercializing critical breakthrough AAM technologies which enhance performance, increase safety, and enable and support more efficient, autonomous, and sustainable flight operations, including electric and hybrid-electric passenger and cargo transport aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing. The Companys plan to source and acquire strategic interests in leading aerospace companies developing breakthrough VTOL aircraft began in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nEffective May 27, 2021, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with XTI Aircraft Company (XTI), a privately owned OEM based in Englewood, Colorado for the purpose of completing the preliminary design of XTIs TriFan 600, a 5-passenger plus pilot, hybrid electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) fixed-wing aircraft.\nThrough the joint venture with XTI, (referred to hereinafter as the XTI JV), the Company was involved in the successful completion of the preliminary design of the TriFan 600 eVTOL aircraft. The TriFan 600 is being designed to become the fastest, longest-range VTOL aircraft in the world and the first commercial fixed-wing VTOL airplane, with current pre-orders of approximately $7 billion in gross revenue upon delivery of those aircraft.\nThe purpose of the XTI JV, preliminary design review (PDR), had been achieved during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. At that point, Xeriant had funded approximately $5.5 million into the XTI JV. On May 17, 2022, Xeriant signed a Letter Agreement with XTI related to the introduction of XTI to Inpixon, a Nasdaq-listed company. Under this Letter Agreement, if there was a combination or other transaction between XTI and Inpixon, Xeriant would receive compensation of 6 percent of XTI fully diluted pre-merger shares, and XTI would assume the obligations of Xeriants Senior Secured Note with Auctus Fund, LLC. On July 25, 2023, Inpixon filed an 8-K, announcing their intention to merge with XTI having executed an Agreement of Plan and Merger with XTI. The filing also showed that XTI had engaged in a transaction with Inpixon on March 10, 2023, receiving $300,000 in funding. Inpixon subsequently filed an S-4/A registration statement on October 6, 2023.\nIn the area of aerospace, management believes that Xeriant can grow expeditiously by acquiring technology and assets primarily through acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and licensing arrangements. As a publicly traded company, the Company offers its subsidiaries such benefits as improved access to capital, higher valuations and lower risk through the shared ownership of a diversified portfolio, while allowing these entities to maintain independence in their distinct operations to focus on their fields of expertise. Cost savings and efficiencies may be realized from sharing non-operational functions such as finance, legal, tax, sales & marketing, human resources, purchasing power, as well as investor and public relations.\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of the Company, American Aviation Technologies, LLC, and Eco-Aero, LLC, its subsidiaries, are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, and related disclosures have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP and presented in US dollars. The fiscal year end is June 30.\nGoing Concern\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred net losses since inception and has an accumulated deficit of $23,638,461 as of June 30, 2023. During the year ended June 30, 2023, the Companys net loss was $7,096,639 and at June 30, 2023, the Company had a working capital deficit of $6,684,867. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Based on its historical rate of expenditures, the Company expects to expend its available cash in approximately two months from October 12, 2023. Managements plans include raising capital through the issuance of common stock and debt to fund operations and, eventually, the generation of revenue through its business. The Company does not expect to generate any significant revenue the foreseeable future. The Company is in immediate need of further working capital and is seeking options, with respect to financing, in the form of debt, equity or a combination thereof.\nFailure to raise adequate capital and generate adequate revenues could result in the Company having to curtail or cease operations. The Companys ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of the common stock is unknown. Additionally, even if the Company does raise sufficient capital to support its operating expenses and generate adequate revenues, there can be no assurances that the revenue will be sufficient to enable it to develop to a level where it will generate profits and cash flows from operations. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern; however, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classifications of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Xeriant, Inc., American Aviation Technologies, LLC (AAT), and Eco-Aero, LLC. The Company owns a 64% controlling interest of AAT; and a 50% interest in Eco-Aero, LLC, with control exercised through a majority membership in the management committee. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to the valuation of beneficial conversion features and warrants associated with convertible debt. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nFair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. ASC Topic 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.\nLevel 2: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3: Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.\nThe estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including all current liabilities are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\nThe inputs to the valuation methodology of stock options and warrants were under level 3 fair value measurements.\nASC subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments (ASC 825-10) requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. All other significant financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows, interest rate risk and credit risk. Where practicable the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed.\nThe Company follows ASC subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820-10) and ASC 825-10, which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nFor the purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company has no cash equivalents.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 360-10, Impairment and Disposal of Long Lived Assets, the Company, on a regular basis, reviews the carrying amount of long-lived assets for the existence of facts or circumstances, both internally and externally, that suggest impairment. The Company determines if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is impaired based on anticipated undiscounted cash flows, before interest, from the use of the asset. In the event of impairment, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is determined based on appraised value of the assets or the anticipated cash flows from the use of the asset, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. During the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company fully impaired its investment in JV with Ebenberg LLC in the amount of $156,460.\nConvertible Debentures\nThe Company adopted the guidance in Accounting Standards Updated (ASU) 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity on July 1, 2022. ASU 2020-06 simplifies an issuers accounting for convertible instruments and its application of the derivatives scope exception for contracts in its own equity. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 removes the requirements for accounting for beneficial conversion features.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2020-06 utilizing the modified retrospective method, which resulted in an immaterial impact to the Company. Prior to adoption of ASU 2020-06, if the conversion features of conventional convertible debt provided for a rate of conversion that is below market value at issuance, this feature was characterized as a beneficial conversion feature (\"BCF\").\nA BCF was recorded by the Company as a debt discount pursuant to ASC Topic 470-20 \"Debt with Conversion and Other Options.\" In those circumstances, the convertible debt was recorded net of the discount related to the BCF, and the Company amortized the discount to interest expense, over the life of the debt. During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company recorded a BCF in the amount of $2,615,419.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity incentive awards based on the grant date fair value of the award. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock options granted to employees or consultants. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, which is usually the vesting period. During the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $702,116 and $3,248,181 in stock-based compensation expense, respectively.\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for leases under ASU 2016-02. At the inception of a contract the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The Companys assessment is based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether it has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company will allocate the consideration in the contract to each lease component based on its relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments.\nOperating lease right of use (ROU) assets represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption date in determining the present value of future payments. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is presented in operating expenses on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nFinance leases are recorded as a finance lease liability and property, plant and equipment asset, based on the present value of lease payments. The asset is depreciated, and the liability is amortized with interest expense incurred over the life of the lease.\nAs permitted under the new guidance, the Company has made an accounting policy election not to apply the recognition provisions of the guidance to short term leases (leases with a lease term of twelve months or less that do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise); instead, the Company will recognize the lease payments for short term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nInvestments\nThe Company follows ASC 325-20, Cost Method Investments, to account for its ownership interest in noncontrolled entities. Under ASC 325-20, equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values (i.e., non-marketable equity securities) and are not required to be accounted for under the equity method are typically carried at cost (i.e., cost method investments). Investments of this nature are initially recorded at cost. Income is recorded for dividends received that are distributed from net accumulated earnings of the noncontrolled entity subsequent to the date of investment. Dividends received in excess of earnings subsequent to the date of investment are considered a return of investment and are recorded as reductions in the cost of the investment. Investments are written down only when there is clear evidence that a decline in value that is other than temporary has occurred. During the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company fully impaired its investment in JV with Ebenberg LLC in the amount of $156,460.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nExpenditures for research and development are expensed as incurred. The Company incurred research and development expenses of $0 and $5,267,581 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAdvertising and Marketing Expenses\nThe Company expenses advertising and marketing costs as they are incurred. The Company recorded advertising expenses in the amount of $23,348 and $651,567 for the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is more likely than not of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of general and administrative expenses. The Companys consolidated federal tax return and any state tax returns are not currently under examination.\nThe Company follows ASC subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes (\"ASC 740-10\") for recording the provision for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability during each period. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change. Deferred income taxes may arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods.\nBasic Income (Loss) Per Share\nUnder the provisions of ASC 260, Earnings per Share, basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that would then share in the income of the Company, subject to anti-dilution limitations. The following potential common shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share available to common stockholders because their effect would have been antidilutive:\nYears ended June 30,\nWarrants\n104,802,161\n55,512,161\nStock options\n21,250,000\n21,250,000\nConvertible notes payable\n62,283,909\n50,968,829\nPreferred stock\n757,395,000\n781,132,000\nTotal\n945,731,070\n908,862,990\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Updated (ASU) 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity, which will simplify an issuers accounting for convertible instruments and its application of the derivatives scope exception for contracts in its own equity. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 removes the requirements for accounting for beneficial conversion features. The guidance is effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this guidance effective July 1, 2022.\nOn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13). ASU 2016-13 requires entities to use a forward-looking approach based on current expected credit losses (CECL) to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables. This may result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The Company implemented ASU 2016-13 on July 1, 2022. The impact on the consolidated financial statements was not material.\nNOTE 3 - JOINT VENTURE\nJoint Venture with XTI Aircraft\nOn May 31, 2021, we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the Agreement) with XTI Aircraft Company (XTI), a Delaware corporation, to form the XTI JV, named Eco-Aero, LLC, with the purpose of completing the preliminary design review (PDR) of XTIs TriFan 600, a 5-passenger plus pilot, hybrid electric, eVTOL fixed wing aircraft. Under the Agreement, Xeriant is contributing capital, technology, and strategic business relationships, and XTI is contributing intellectual property licensing rights and know-how. XTI and the Company each own 50 percent of the XTI JV, and it is managed by a management committee consisting of five members, three appointed by Xeriant and two by XTI. The Agreement was effective on May 27, 2021, with an initial deposit of $1 million into the XTI JV. The Companys financial commitment is up to $10 million, contributed as needed to complete the preliminary design of the aircraft. XTI completed Preliminary Design Review during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, which was the purpose of the XTI JV.\nOn May 17, 2022, we executed a confidential Letter Agreement with XTI, the material terms of which are briefly delineated as follows:\nXeriant would be entitled to compensation for its role in introducing XTI to Inpixon, a Nasdaq-listed company, contingent upon the occurrence of any merger, combination, or transactional event between XTI and the Nasdaq company.\nXTI would assume the financial obligations related to the Senior Secured Note with Auctus Fund, LLC, including the $6.05 million principal balance of the note and warrant obligations. Additionally, Xeriant was to be granted a fully diluted equity interest amounting to 6% in XTI, issued immediately prior to any prospective combination with Inpixon.\nOn June 5, 2023, after suspecting that the obligations under the Letter Agreement were possibly being evaded, the Company transmitted a formal demand letter to XTI requesting compliance with the provisions outlined in the Letter Agreement, and in accordance with section 8 of the JV Agreement with XTI.\nAs of the date of this filing, we remain engaged in dialogue with XTI to enforce compliance with the Letter Agreement and to find an amicable resolution.\nThe Company analyzed the transaction under ASC 810, Consolidation, to determine if the joint venture classifies as a Variable Interest Entity (VIE). The JV qualifies as a VIE based on the fact the JV does not have sufficient equity to operate without financial support from Xeriant. According to ASC 810-25-38, a reporting entity shall consolidate a VIE when that reporting entity has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) that provides the reporting entity with a controlling financial interest on the basis of the provisions in paragraphs 810-10-25-38A through 25-38J. The reporting entity that consolidates a VIE is called the primary beneficiary of that VIE. According to the JV operating agreement, the ownership interests are 50/50. However, the agreement provides for a Management Committee of five members. Three of the five members are from Xeriant. Additionally, Xeriant had a right to invest up to $10,000,000 into the JV. As such, Xeriant has substantial capital at risk. Based on these two factors, the conclusion is that Xeriant is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, Xeriant has consolidated the VIE.\nThe Company includes the assets and liabilities related to the VIE in the consolidated balance sheets. Xeriant, Inc. provides cash to the VIE to fund its operations. The carrying amounts of consolidated VIE's assets and liabilities associated with the VIE subsidiary were as follows:\nJune 30, 2023\nJune 30, 2022\nAssets\nCash\n$ -\n$ 4,516\nTotal Assets\n$ -\n$ 4,516\nLiabilities\nDue from Xeriant Inc.\n$ 4,475,155\n$ 4,479,547\nTotal Liabilities\n$ 4,475,155\n$ 4,479,547\nJoint Venture with Movychem\nOn April 2, 2022, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with Movychem s.r.o., a Slovakian limited liability company, to exploit the Movychem Intellectual Property and the Purchased Patents. The Joint Venture is organized as a Florida limited liability company under the name Ebenberg, LLC, owned 50% by each of the Company and Movychem.\nFor its capital contribution to the Joint Venture, pursuant to a Patent and Exclusive License and Assignment Agreement (the Patent Agreement), Movychem would transfer to the Joint Venture all of its interest to the know-how and intellectual property relating to Retacell\u00ae exclusive of all patents, and the Company would contribute the amount of $2,600,000 payable (a) $600,000 at the rate of $25,000 per month over a 24 month period and (b) $2,000,000 within five business days of a closing of a financing in which the Company receives net proceeds of at least $3,000,000 but in no event later than six months from the Effective Date. At such time as the Company makes a $2,000,000 payment (and assuming the Company is current with its then monthly capital contributions), pursuant to the Patent Agreement, Movychem would transfer all of its rights, title and interest to all of the patents related to Retacell for an amount equal to aggregate cash contributions of the Company to the Joint Venture plus 40% of all royalty payments received by the Joint Venture for the licensing of Retacell products. Pending assignment of the patents to the Joint Venture, pursuant to the Patent Agreement, Movychem would grant to the Joint Venture an exclusive worldwide license under the patents.\nUnder the Joint Venture Agreement, the Company agreed to grant to certain individuals affiliated with Movychem five-year warrants (the Warrants) to purchase an aggregate of 170,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share with vesting depending on the satisfaction of various milestones as described therein. of which none have yet to occur.\nThe Company analyzed the transaction under ASC 810, Consolidation, to determine if the joint venture classifies as a Variable Interest Entity (VIE). The Joint Venture qualifies as a VIE based on the fact the JV does not have sufficient equity to operate without financial support from both parties. According to ASC 810-25-38, a reporting entity shall consolidate a VIE when that reporting entity has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) that provides the reporting entity with a controlling financial interest on the basis of the provisions in paragraphs 810-10-25-38A through 25-38J. The reporting entity that consolidates a VIE is called the primary beneficiary of that VIE. According to the JV operating agreement, the ownership interests are 50/50 and the agreement provides for a Management Committee of five members. Two of the five members are from Xeriant and Movychem, respectively and one is appointed by mutual agreement of the parties. Movychem is transferring to the Joint Venture all of its interest to the know-how and intellectual property relating to Retacell exclusive of all patents, and the Company is contributing cash. As such, both parties do not have substantial capital at risk. Based on these two factors, the conclusion is that no one is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, Xeriant has not consolidated the VIE.\nThe Joint Venture Agreement granted to Movychem the right to dissolve the Joint Venture in the event that the Company fails to make any of its capital contributions in which case the Joint Venture will be required to grant back to Movychem all joint venture intellectual property and the assignment to Movychem of any outstanding licenses. After working with Movychem over the past year and experiencing a number of issues, including but not limited to Movychems unwillingness to provide material documentation, processes and information required for the exploitation of Retacell\u00ae, the Company independently developed an upcycled construction panel, without the inclusion of Retacell\u00ae, outside of the Movychem JV.\nOn August 12, 2022, the Company filed the trademark NexBoard, for construction panels, namely, composite sheets and panels composed primarily of plastic, reinforcement materials and fire-retardant chemicals for use in walls, ceilings, flooring, framing, siding, roofing and decking. The trademark filing was intentionally broad and based upon demand for a general all-purpose construction panel made from a mixture of fire-retardant and recycled materials.\nBecause of Movychems non-performance as described above, Xeriant ceased paying Movychem $25,000 per month as provided in the Joint Venture beginning December 2022. On February 13, 2023, Movychem formally requested dissolution of its Joint Venture with Xeriant, named Ebenberg, LLC. On February 24, 2023, Xeriant provided a formal response to Movychem, highlighting its multiple and sustained lapses in collaborative efforts related to the commercialization of the Retacell technology. Subsequent to this communication, Xeriant expressly repudiated Movychems proposition for dissolution and their proposition to take an exclusive territory to market Retacell\u00ae. Because Xeriant is focused on commercialization and industrial-level production of eco-friendly composite construction panels, and has moved beyond the Retacell\u00ae technology, the Company agreed to dissolution of the Ebenberg, LLC Joint Venture effective June 30, 2023.\nAs of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company contributed $312,919 and $115,356 to the joint venture.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company fully impaired its investment in JV with Ebenberg LLC in the amount of $156,460.\nNOTE 4 - CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKS\nThe Company maintains accounts with financial institutions. All cash in checking accounts is non-interest bearing and is fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). At times, cash balances may exceed the maximum coverage provided by the FDIC on insured depositor accounts. The Company believes it mitigates its risk by depositing its cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions. On June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $0 and $811,429 in excess of FDIC insurance, respectively.\nNOTE 5 - OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITY\nThe Company leases 2,911 square feet of office space located in the Research Park at Florida Atlantic University, Innovation Centre 1, 3998 FAU Boulevard, Suite 309, Boca Raton, Florida. The Company entered into a lease agreement commencing on November 1, 2019, through January 1, 2025, in which the first three months of rent were abated. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company decided to have all employees work from home and intends to build out the office space by the end of October 2023 to allow employees to work from the office beginning in November of 2023. The following table illustrates the base rent amounts over the term of the lease:\nBase Rent Periods\nNovember 1, 2019 to October 31, 2020\n$ 4,367\nNovember 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021\n$ 4,498\nNovember 1, 2021 to October 31, 2022\n$ 4,633\nNovember 1, 2022 to October 31, 2023\n$ 4,772\nNovember 1, 2023 to October 31, 2024\n$ 4,915\nNovember 1, 2024 to January 31, 2025\n$ 5,063\nOperating lease right-of-use asset and liability are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value is the Companys incremental borrowing rate, estimated to be 10%, as the interest rate implicit in most of the Companys leases is not readily determinable. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Since the common area maintenance expenses are expenses that do not depend on an index or rate, they are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability and recognized in other general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. During the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $53,327 and $54,393 in rent expense, respectively in other general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\nRight-of-use asset is summarized below:\nJune 30, 2023\nJune 30, 2022\nOffice lease\n$ 220,448\n$ 220,448\nLess accumulated amortization\n(137,537 )\n(92,106\n)\nRight of use assets, net\n$ 82,911\n$ 128,342\nOperating lease liability is summarized below:\nJune 30, 2023\nJune 30, 2022\nOffice lease\n$ 92,196\n$ 141,160\nLess: current portion\n(55,999 )\n(48,963 )\nLong term portion\n$ 36,197\n$ 92,197\nMaturity of lease liabilities are as follows:\nYear ended June 30, 2024\n$ 62,201\nYear ended June 30, 2025\n37,112\nTotal future minimum lease payments\n99,313\nLess: Present value discount\n(7,117 )\nLease liability\n$ 92,196\nNOTE 6 - CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE, IN DEFAULT\nThe carrying value of convertible notes payable, net of discount, as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, was $5,850,000 and $3,936,185, respectively.\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nConvertible Notes Payable\nConvertible notes payable issued October 27, 2021 (0% interest) - Auctus Fund LLC\n$ 5,850,000\n$ 6,050,000\nTotal face value\n5,850,000\n6,050,000\nLess unamortized discount\n-\n(2,113,815 )\nCarrying value\n$ 5,850,000\n$ 3,936,185\nAuctus Fund LLC Senior Secured Note\nThrough Maxim Group, LLC, Xeriant was introduced to Auctus Fund, LLC (Auctus) for the purpose of providing a bridge loan funding to satisfy the requirements of a pending merger with XTI Aircraft under a binding term sheet signed in September 2021. On October 27, 2021, the Company was issued a convertible note payable with Auctus Fund, LLC (the Auctus Note) with the principal of $6,050,000, consisting of $5,142,500, which was the actual amount funded, plus an original issue discount in the amount of $907,500 for interest on the unpaid principal amount at the rate of zero percent per annum from the issue date until the note becomes due and payable. The closing costs were $433,550, which included $308,550 in fees paid to Maxim and professional fees for completing the transaction. The Note had an initial due date of October 27, 2022. The Auctus Note provides the holder has the option to convert the principal balance to common stock of the Company at a conversion price of the lesser of (i) $0.1187 or (ii) 75% of the offering price per share divided by the number of shares of common stock. The Auctus Note is secured by the grant of a first priority security interest in the assets of the Company. In connection with the Auctus Note, the Company issued warrants indexed to an aggregate of 50,968,828 shares of common stock. The warrants have a term of five years and an exercise price of $0.1187.\nEffective August 1, 2022, the Company entered into an Amendment to the Senior Secured Promissory Note (the First Amendment) with Auctus pursuant to which the parties agreed to amend the Auctus Note. The Amendment (i) extended the maturity date of the Auctus Note to November 1, 2022, and (ii) extended the dates for the completion of the acquisition of XTI Aircraft and the uplist of the Companys common stock to a national securities exchange to November 1, 2022. In consideration of the Amendment, the Company agreed to (i) grant to Auctus a new Warrant to purchase 25,000,000 shares of common stock dated July 26, 2022 (the Warrant) at an exercise price of $0.09 per share and 5-year term; (ii) make a prepayment of the Note in the amount of $100,000; and (iii) cause a director of the Company to cancel his 10b-5(1) Plan.\nEffective December 27, 2022, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to the Senior Secured Promissory Note (the Second Amendment) with Auctus pursuant to which the parties agreed to further amend the Auctus Note. The Second Amendment (i) extended the maturity date of the Note, the obligation to uplist to a national securities exchange and acquisition of XTI Aircraft Company to March 15, 2023, and (ii) extended the date to file an S-1 registration statement to uplist the Companys common stock to a national securities exchange to January 15, 2023. In consideration of the Amendment, the Company agreed to (i) grant to Auctus a new Warrant to purchase 250,000,000 shares of Common Stock dated December 27, 2022 (the New Warrant) at an exercise price of $0.09 per share and 5-year term, and (ii) make two pre-payment installments of $50,000 on January 15, 2023, and February 15, 2023. As of June 30, 2023, a total of $50,000 remains outstanding and is recorded within accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nSince the Note was issued pre-adoption of ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity, the Company was required to determine if the debt contained a beneficial conversion feature (BCF), which is based on the intrinsic value on the date of issuance. The Company recorded a beneficial conversion feature in the amount of $2,365,419 in additional paid-in capital. The BCF resulted in a debt discount and is amortized over the life of the note.\nThe Company tested the first modification (First Amendment) under ASC 470-50-40 to determine if the modification resulted in an extinguishment. It was determined the present value of the cash flows under the terms of the new debt instrument was at least 10 percent different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of the original instrument. As a result, the modification resulted in a loss on an extinguishment in the amount of $3,570,366 for the year ended June 30,2023. The loss on extinguishment was determined as follows:\nReacquisition Price:\nModified convertible debt instrument\n$ 5,950,000\nFair value of warrants\n1,918,393\nCash payment\n100,000\n$ 7,968,393\nCarrying Value of Original Instrument\nOriginal convertible debt instrument\n$ 6,050,000\nDebt discount - warrant\n(707,585 )\nOriginal issue discount\n(341,692 )\nDebt discount - BCF\n(602,696 )\nCarrying value of original debt\n4,398,027\nLoss on extinguishment\n$ 3,570,366\nThe Company tested the second modification (Second Amendment) under ASC 470-50-40 to determine if the modification resulted in an extinguishment. It was determined the present value of the cash flows under the terms of the new debt instrument was at least 10 percent different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of the original instrument. As a result, the modification resulted in a loss on an extinguishment in the amount of $689,621. The loss on extinguishment was determined as follows:\nReacquisition Price:\nModified convertible debt instrument\n$\n5,850,000\nFair value of warrants\n689,621\nAccrued Short-term Liability\n100,000\n$\n6,639,621\nCarrying Value of Original Instrument\nCarrying value of original debt\n5,950,000\nLoss on extinguishment\n$\n689,621\nFor the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $461,842 and $4,369,735 in amortization of debt discount related to the Auctus note, respectively. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of the Auctus note was $5,850,000 and $3,936,185, respectively.\nNOTE 7 - CONVERTIBLE BRIDGE LOANS - AT FAIR VALUE\nBetween January 13, 2023, and March 31, 2023, the Company issued convertible bridge loans with an aggregate face value of $270,000. The notes have a coupon rate of 10% and a maturity date of one year. If the Company has a liquidity event (i.e. the Company a public offering of common stock (or units consisting of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock), resulting in the listing for trading of the common stock on the NYSE American, the Nasdaq Capital Market, the Nasdaq Global Market, the Nasdaq Global Select Market, or the New York Stock Exchange), the notes and any accrued interest automatically convert into common stock. The Liquidity Event Conversion Price is the lesser of (a) $0.09 and (b) the product of (x) the Liquidity Event Price multiplied by (z) 75%. In the event a liquidity event does not occur, the Holder has the option to convert the Notes on the maturity date at a conversion price of $0.09.\nIn addition to the Notes, the holders received an aggregate 2,700,000 warrants. The warrants have an exercise price of $0.09 per share and have a five-year exercise term.\nThe Company analyzed the Convertible Bridge Loans to determine if they were within the scope of ASC 480 Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. The Contract embodies a conditional obligation to transfer a variable number of shares in which the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on, among other things, a fixed monetary amount known at inception. Additionally, the obligation is, in substance, a traditional debt arrangement, with the stock of the issuer used as the form of currency for repayment. As a result, the instruments are recorded at fair value pursuant to ASC 480-10-30-7. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of the Convertible Bridge Loans was $247,254 and $0, respectively. During the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded $10,083 and $0 in interest expense related to these loans, respectively. During the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded $57,368 and $0 in decrease in fair value of Convertible Bridge Loans, respectively.\nThe Company evaluated the detachable warrants under the requirements of ASC 480 and concluded that the warrants do not fall within the scope of ASC 480. The Company next evaluated the notes under the requirements of ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging and concluded the warrants meet equity classification. The warrants were valued using Black-Scholes Merton (BSM) and were determined to have a value of $80,114, which is recorded in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity.\nNOTE 8 - CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE\nBetween May 13, 2023, and June 28, 2023, the Company issued convertible bridge loans with an aggregate face value of $100,000. The notes have a coupon rate of 10% and a maturity date of one year. The Notes are convertible at a fixed price of $0.01 per share. Since the Company adopted ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity, on July 1, 2022, it was not required to determine if the debt contained a beneficial conversion feature (BCF). As such, the Note was recorded as straight debt. During the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded $483 in interest expense related to these notes.\nNOTE 9 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe following table presents the fair value hierarchy for the Companys assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2023 and 2022:\nJune 30, 2023\nJune 30, 2022\nDescription\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nAssets\nConvertible Bridge Loans\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 247,254\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nFair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 3 instruments are characterized by unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, which require management judgment or estimation. The fair value of the Convertible Bridge Loans have three components: (i) principal, (ii) interest, and (iii) a redemption feature. The first two components (i.e. principal and interest) were valued using an income approach. For the Redemption Feature, the Company uses a Black-Scholes Merton (BSM) valuation technique because it believes that this technique is reflective of all significant assumption types, and ranges of assumption inputs, that market participants would likely consider in transactions involving this component. Such assumptions include market price, strike price, term, market trading volatility and risk-free rates.\nSignificant inputs and results arising from the BSM process are as follows for the redemption feature component of the Convertible Bridge Loans:\nInception Dates\nYear Ended\nQuoted market price on valuation date\n$0.027 - $0.05\n$ 0.024\nEffective contractual conversion rates\n$0.09 - $0.012\n$ 0.09\nContractual term to maturity\n0.4 -1 year\n0.25 - 0.75 year\nMarket volatility:\nVolatility\n115% - 135%\n93.58% - 105.56%\nRisk-adjusted interest rate\n4.32% - 5.14%\n5.40% - 5.47%\nThe following table summarizes the total carrying value of the Companys Level 3 instruments held as of June 30, 2023, including cumulative unrealized gains and losses recognized during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:\nPeriod Ended\nJune 30,\nBalances at beginning of period\n$ -\n$ -\nIssuances:\nConvertible Bridge Loans\n189,886\n-\nChanges in fair value inputs and assumptions reflected in income\n57,368\n-\nBalances at end of period\n$ 247,254\n$ -\nNOTE 10 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nConsulting fees\nDuring the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $170,000 and $184,000 respectively, in consulting fees to Ancient Investments, LLC, a Company owned by the Companys CEO, Keith Duffy and the Companys Executive Director of Corporate Operations, Scott Duffy.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\nAt June 30, 2023 and 2022, the significant components of the deferred tax assets are summarized below:\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nNet operating loss carry-forward\n$ 7,460,414\n$ 5,860,409\nValuation Allowance\n(7,460,414 )\n(5,860,409 )\nNet Deferred Tax Asset (Liability)\n$ -\n$ -\nThe Company periodically evaluates the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and adjusts the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets by the valuation allowance to the extent the future realization of the deferred tax assets is not judged to be more likely than not. The Company considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of its deferred tax assets, including its recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income or loss, the carryforward periods available to the Company for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.\nFuture changes in the unrecognized tax benefit will have no impact on the effective tax rate due to the existence of the valuation allowance. The Company estimates that the unrecognized tax benefit will not change significantly within the next twelve months. The Company will continue to classify income tax penalties and interest as part of general and administrative expenses in its consolidated statements of operations. There were no interest or penalties accrued as of June 30, 2023.\nNOTE 15 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn August 7, 2023, the Company established a wholly owned subsidiary, BlueGreen Composites, LLC, to better manage the business operations of the green building products business line. As of the date of this filing, no bank account was opened, no contracts or agreements were executed, and no business operations were undertaken.\nOn July 30, 2023, we filed the trademark BlueGreen for ecofriendly composite building products and Durever for the same categories on July 31, 2023.\nFrom July 1, 2023, through October 12, 2023, a total of $461,000 in convertible notes were issued. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nEffective August 31, 2023, the Company engaged Accell Audit & Compliance, PA, replacing BF Borgers CPA P.C. as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm. The engagement was approved by the Companys Board of Directors. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management is responsible for maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Registrant files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. In addition, the disclosure controls and procedures must ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial and other required disclosures.\nAt June 30, 2023, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) of the Exchange Act) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of Keith Duffy our Chief Executive Officer and Brian Carey our Chief Financial Officer. Based on his evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, he concluded that, at June 30, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions\u037e (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements\u037e (iii) provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization\u037e and (iv) provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions may occur or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management has conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of Keith Duffy, our Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Carey, our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023. This evaluation was based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO, Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based upon such assessment, Keith Duffy concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective based upon the Companys size and staff size, and that there are no apparent material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThis Report shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. The rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission do not require an attestation of the Management's report by our registered public accounting firm in this annual report.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The OTCQB trading platform does not maintain any standards regarding the independence of the directors for our Board of Directors, and we are not otherwise subject to the requirements of any national securities exchange or an inter- dealer quotation system with respect to the need to have a majority of our directors be independent.\nThe Companys Board presently has no functioning standing committees.\nBoard Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight\nAlthough we have not adopted a formal policy on whether the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer should be separate or combined, we have traditionally determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to combine these roles due to the small size and early stage of the Company.\nFamily Relationships\nKeith Duffy, Chairman and CEO, and Scott Duffy, Executive Director, are brothers.\nBoard Committees\nAudit Committee\nWe do not have a separately designated audit committee of the board. Audit committee functions are performed by our board of directors. None of our directors are deemed independent. Two directors also hold positions as our officers.
