TCBM is a holding corporation, which operated through its two wholly owned subsidiaries, HMNRTH, LLC and 911 Help Now, LLC.\nAbout HMNRTH, LLC\nHMNRTH, LLC (HMN) was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on July 30, 2019. HMNRTH operates as an online store selling a variety of hemp and CBD related products. The Companys business model is to bridge the gap between the lifestyle and knowledge components within the cannabis industry. The Companys goal is to educate every consumer while cultivating an experience by providing quality products, branded cutting-edge content, and diversified product lines for any purpose. Most importantly, we want our clients to discover their inner HMN, redefine their inner HMN and Empower their inner HMN.\nIn September 2019, the Company entered into a Quality Agreement with Nutralife Biosciences for the development and production of its CBD line of products. The Companys product line includes hemp derived, full spectrum cannabidiol tinctures and creams in varying sizes.\nIn order for the Company to generate revenue through HMNRTH, we will need to: (i) produce additional inventory for retail sales through the Companys ecommerce site or sales, or (ii) sales to third party distributors, or (iii) direct sales to brick and mortar CBD retail outlets, or (iv) generate additional CBD formulas to be utilized in new products At present, the Company does not have the required capital to move forward with any of the options and there is no guarantee that we will be able to raise the required funds.\nRegulation of HMNRTH products:\nThe manufacture, labelling and distribution of our products is regulated by various federal, state and local agencies. These governmental authorities may commence regulatory or legal proceedings, which could restrict the permissible scope of our product claims or the ability to sell our products in the future. The FDA regulates our nutraceutical and wellness products to ensure that the products are not adulterated or misbranded.\nWe are subject to additional regulation as a result of our CBD products. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that we may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nFailure to comply with FDA requirements may result in, among other things, injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, product seizures, fines and criminal prosecutions. Our advertising is subject to regulation by the FTC under the FTCA. Additionally, some states also permit advertising and labelling laws to be enforced by private attorney generals, who may seek relief for consumers, seek class action certifications, seek class wide damages and product recalls of products sold by us. Any actions against us by governmental authorities or private litigants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAbout 911 Help Now, LLC\nHelp Now, LLC (911) was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on February 2, 2018. 911 was a holding company of intellectual property in the safety and security space. At present, we own no intellectual property within our 911 subsidiary. In order to generate future revenue within 911, we will need to identify and either acquire or license intellectual property. In the event of an acquisition, we will then need to either develop products utilizing our intellectual property or license out our intellectual property to a third party. There is no guarantee that we will be successful with an acquisition or licensing of any intellectual property.\nAbout Markets on Main, LLC\nMarkets on Main, LLC (MOM) was formed as a Florida limited liability company on April 2, 2020.

(Tersus) (Delaware) was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary as per the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement entered into with Tersus Power, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and the Tersus Shareholders with the sole purpose of entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to effect a name change. The Articles of Incorporation were filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on March 15, 2022.

The Company is in the process of refiling the same corporate action. The delay on the corporate action becoming effective has required Tersus Power to seek alternate financing and to reevaluate its business plan. On May 24, 2023, the Company notified Tersus Power that it has elected to terminate the Exchange Agreement as per section 5.1(a)(iv). Please see NOTE F - NOTE RECEIVABLE for further information.\nConsulting Services\nOn January 12, 2022, the Company entered into a Fee Agreement (the Agreement) for the preparation of a registration statement on Form 1-A and all follow up correspondence with the appropriate regulatory agencies. The Company was fully compensated for its services during the period ended March 31, 2022 and has fulfilled its obligations under the Agreement.\nOn February 1, 2022, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement (the Agreement) with Donohoe Advisory Services, Inc. (Donohoe) to provide assistance to the Company in support of the Companys efforts to obtain a listing on a national securities exchange. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company shall pay Donohoe an initial retainer in the amount of $17,500 and if successful a success fee in the amount of $10,000 in cash or registered shares of common stock.

As of June 30, 2023, the Company has initiated the work to be completed under the Agreement but is awaiting additional information from its client.\nResearch and development\nFor the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we had $0 and $0 research and development costs, respectively.\nEmployees\nCurrently, Global Technologies has one full-time employee. We intend on retaining additional officers, ancillary staff and consultants during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\nPotential Future Acquisitions\nIn implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another company or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon consummation of a transaction, it is probable that our present management and stockholders will no longer be in control of us. In addition, our sole director may, as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, resign and be replaced by new directors without a vote of our stockholders, or sell his stock in us. Any such sale will only be made in compliance with the securities laws of the United States and any applicable state.\nIt is anticipated that any securities issued in any such acquisition would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under application federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, as a negotiated element of the transaction, we may agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. If such registration occurs, it will be undertaken by the surviving entity after it has successfully consummated a merger or acquisition and is no longer considered an inactive company.\nThe issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in our securities may have a depressive effect on the value of our securities in the future. There is no assurance that such a trading market will develop.\nWhile the actual terms of a transaction cannot be predicted, it is expected that the parties to any business transaction will find it desirable to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the business transaction in a so-called tax-free reorganization under Sections 368(a)(1) or 351 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). In order to obtain tax-free treatment under the Code, it may be necessary for the owner of the acquired business to own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. In such event, our stockholders would retain less than 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This would result in significant dilution in the equity of our stockholders.\nAs part of our investigation, we expect to meet personally with management and key personnel, visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis of verification of certain information provided, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of our limited financial resources and management expertise. The manner in which we participate in an opportunity will depend on the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of both parties, and the management of the opportunity.\nWith respect to any merger or acquisition, and depending upon, among other things, the target companys assets and liabilities, our stockholders will in all likelihood hold a substantially lesser percentage ownership interest in us following any merger or acquisition. The percentage ownership may be subject to significant reduction in the event we acquire a target company with assets and expectations of growth. Any merger or acquisition can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our stockholders.\nWe will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate written business agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally we anticipate that such agreements will (i) require specific representations and warranties by all of the parties; (ii) specify certain events of default; (iii) detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties prior to and after such closing; (iv) outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with the Companys attorneys and accountants; (v) set forth remedies on defaults; and (vi) include miscellaneous other terms.\nAs stated above, we will not acquire or merge with any entity which cannot provide independent audited financial statements within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or within time parameters necessary to ensure our compliance within the requirements of the 1934 Act, or if the audited financial statements provided do not conform to the representations made by that business to be acquired, the definitive closing documents will provide that the proposed transaction will be voidable, at the discretion of our present management. If such transaction is voided, the definitive closing documents will also contain a provision providing for reimbursement for our costs associated with the proposed transaction.\nThere are no guarantees that we will be successful in Closing any additional acquisitions or mergers.\nCompetition\nWe believe we are an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and financial concerns that have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than we have. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.\nIn reference to our subsidiary 911 Help Now (911), the Personal Emergency Response marketplace is a large and fragmented market, which has many competitors with larger financial resources than us. Our differentiating factor in this space is our no monthly fee sales model. At present, we own no intellectual property within our 911 subsidiary. In order to generate future revenue within 911, we will need to identify and either acquire or license intellectual property. In the event of an acquisition, we will then need to either develop products utilizing our intellectual property or license out our intellectual property to a third party. There is no guarantee that we will be successful with an acquisition or licensing of any intellectual property.\nIn reference to our subsidiary HMNRTH (HMNRTH), the market for the sale of CBD-based products is fragmented and intensely competitive. Currently, in the United States, we do not believe that there are any businesses that can demonstrate or claim a dominant market share of the growing CBD products market. Our competitors in the retail location sales of CBD-based products include Green Roads, PlusCBD, and Select CBD, and in the digital space include Diamond CBD, CBDistillery, and Lazarus Natural. We expect that the quantity and composition of the competitive environment will continue to evolve as the industry matures and new customers enter the marketplace. In order for the Company to generate revenue through HMNRTH, we will need to: (i) produce additional inventory for retail sales through the Companys ecommerce site or sales, or (ii) sales to third party distributors, or (iii) direct sales to brick and mortar CBD retail outlets, or (iv) generate additional CBD formulas to be utilized in new products At present, the Company does not have the required capital to move forward with any of the options and there is no guarantee that we will be able to raise the required funds.\nIn reference to our newly formed business operation through our subsidiary Markets on Main (MOM), the Companys goal is to become a leader in sales and distribution of entrepreneur driven products, in a highly competitive industry. We compete with companies from all industries, some of which have substantially more resources, stronger name recognition, and longer operating histories than us, and which benefit from greater economies of scale.\nWe target products that leverage some sort of intellectual property that we may own or license from the entrepreneurs. Under the Companys business plan, we anticipate that certain of our licensors will have reserved the right to manufacture, distribute and sell similar or identical products. Some of these products could directly compete with our products and could be sold to our customers or directly to consumers at lower prices than those at which our products are sold. Our competitors for MOM include Funko, Inc. and other dropship entities.\nInvestment Company Act 1940\nAlthough we will be subject to regulation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the 1934 Act, we believe we will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act) insofar as we will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities. In the event we engage in business combinations that result in us holding passive investment interests in a number of entities, we could be subject to regulation under the 1940 Act. In such event, we would be required to register as an investment company and incur significant registration and compliance costs. We have obtained no formal determination from the SEC as to our status under the 1940 Act and, consequently, any violation of the 1940 Act would subject us to material adverse consequences. We believe that, currently, we are exempt under Regulation 3a-2 of the 1940 Act.\nIntellectual Property\nWe own no intellectual property.\nCorporate Information\nOur principal executive office is located at 8 Campus Drive, Suite 105 Parsippany, New Jersey 07054 and our telephone number is (973) 233-5151.

Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and other information in this prospectus, including the financial statements and related notes that appear at the end of this prospectus, before deciding to invest in our securities. These risks should be considered in conjunction with any other information included herein, including in conjunction with forward-looking statements made herein. If any of the following risks actually occur, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Company\nWe have incurred significant losses and anticipate future losses.\nAs of June 30, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $167,478,377 and a stockholders deficit of approximately $4,528,007.\nFuture losses are likely to occur as, until we are able to merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create value for our shareholders as we have no sources of income to meet our operating expenses. As a result of these, among other factors, we received from our registered independent public accountants in their report for the financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur existing financial resources are insufficient to meet our ongoing operating expenses.\nWe have no sources of income at this time and no existing cash balances to meet our ongoing operating expenses. In the short term, unless we are able to raise additional debt and/or equity we shall be unable to meet our ongoing operating expenses. On a longer-term basis, we intend to raise the debt and/or equity to meet our ongoing operating expenses and merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create value for our shareholders. There can be no assurance that this series of events will be successfully completed.\nScarcity of, and competition for, business opportunities and combinations.\nWe believe we are an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and financial concerns that have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than we have. Nearly all such entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than us and, consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. Moreover, we will also compete in seeking merger or acquisition candidates with numerous other small public companies. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.\nWe may be negatively affected by adverse general economic conditions.\nCurrent conditions in domestic and global economies are extremely uncertain. Adverse changes may occur as a result of softening global economies, wavering consumer confidence caused by the threat of terrorism and war, and other factors capable of affecting economic conditions. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nBecause our former sole officer and director controls our voting activities, he may cause us to act in a manner that is most beneficial to himself and not to other shareholders which could cause us not to take actions that outside investors might view favorably.\nOur former sole officer and director, has voting authority for approximately ninety percent (90%) of our outstanding voting stock. As a result, he effectively controls all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers and related party transactions. These insiders also have the ability to delay or perhaps even block, by their ownership of our stock, an unsolicited tender offer. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company that you might view favorably.\nOur sole officer and director may have conflicts of interest which may not be resolved favorably to us.\nCertain conflicts of interest may exist between our sole director and us. Our sole officer and director has other business interests to which he devotes his attention and may be expected to continue to do so although management time should be devoted to our business. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise that can be resolved only through exercise of such judgment as is consistent with fiduciary duties to us. See Directors and Executive Officers (page 42 below).\nWe may depend upon outside consultants/advisors; who may not be available on reasonable terms and as needed.\nTo supplement the business experience of our officers and directors, we may be required to employ accountants, technical experts, appraisers, attorneys, or other consultants or advisors. Our Board, without any input from stockholders, will make the selection of any such advisors. Furthermore, it is anticipated that such persons may be engaged on an as needed basis without a continuing fiduciary or other obligation to us. In the event we consider it necessary to hire outside advisors, we may elect to hire persons who are affiliates, if they are able to provide the required services.\nWe may not be able to meet the filing and internal control reporting requirements imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which may result in a decline in the price of our common shares and an inability to obtain future financing.\nAs directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as amended by SEC Release No. 33-8934 on June 26, 2008, the SEC adopted rules requiring each public company to include a report of management on the companys internal controls over financial reporting in its annual reports. In addition, the independent registered public accounting firm auditing a companys financial statements may have to also attest to and report on managements assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal controls over financial reporting. We may be required to include a report of management on its internal control over financial reporting. The internal control report must include a statement:\n\u25cf Of managements responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over its financial reporting;\n\u25cf Of managements assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of year-end; and\n\u25cf Of the framework used by management to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nFurthermore, our independent registered public accounting firm may be required to file its attestation on whether it believes that we have maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting.\nWhile we expect to expend significant resources in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, there is a risk that we may not be able to comply timely with all of the requirements imposed by this rule. In the event that we are unable to receive a positive attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our internal controls, investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and our stock price and ability to obtain equity or debt financing as needed could suffer.\nIn addition, in the event that our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to rely on our internal controls in connection with its audit of our financial statements, and in the further event that it is unable to devise alternative procedures in order to satisfy itself as to the material accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures, it is possible that we would be unable to file our Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC, which could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to secure additional financing as needed.\nReporting requirements under the Exchange Act and compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including establishing and maintaining acceptable internal controls over financial reporting, are costly and may increase substantially.\nThe rules and regulations of the SEC require a public company to prepare and file periodic reports under the Exchange Act, which will require that the Company engage legal, accounting, auditing and other professional services. The engagement of such services is costly. Additionally, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) requires, among other things, that we design, implement and maintain adequate internal controls and procedures over financial reporting. The costs of complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the limited technically qualified personnel we have may make it difficult for us to design, implement and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting. In the event that we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may not be able to produce reliable financial reports or report fraud, which may harm our overall financial condition and result in loss of investor confidence and a decline in our share price.\nAs a public company, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Despite recent reforms made possible by the JOBS Act, compliance with these rules and regulations will nonetheless increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results.\nWe are working with our legal, accounting and financial advisors to identify those areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as a public company. These areas include corporate governance, corporate control, disclosure controls and procedures and financial reporting and accounting systems. We have made, and will continue to make, changes in these and other areas. However, we anticipate that the expenses that will be required in order to adequately prepare for being a public company could be material. We estimate that the aggregate cost of increased legal services; accounting and audit functions; personnel, such as a chief financial officer familiar with the obligations of public company reporting; consultants to design and implement internal controls; and financial printing alone will be a few hundred thousand dollars per year and could be several hundred thousand dollars per year. In addition, if and when we retain independent directors and/or additional members of senior management, we may incur additional expenses related to director compensation and/or premiums for directors and officers liability insurance, the costs of which we cannot estimate at this time. We may also incur additional expenses associated with investor relations and similar functions, the cost of which we also cannot estimate at this time. However, these additional expenses individually, or in the aggregate, may also be material.\nIn addition, being a public company could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors and officers liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nThe increased costs associated with operating as a public company may decrease our net income or increase our net loss and may cause us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services to offset the effect of such increased costs. Additionally, if these requirements divert our managements attention from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have material weakness in our controls and procedures.\nWe have conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations for the Treadway Commission (COSO) and published in 2013, and subsequent guidance prepared by COSO specifically for smaller public companies. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2023 and 2022 for the reasons discussed below:\nManagement identified the following material weakness and significant deficiencies in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023:\n\u25cf The Company did not maintain effective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting process because we lacked personnel with accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure that is commensurate with our financial reporting requirements.\n\u25cf Material Weakness - Inadequate segregation of duties.\nThe management of the Company believes that these material weaknesses will remain until such time that the Company has the resources to increase the number of personnel committed to the performance of its financial duties that such weaknesses can be specifically addressed. This will include, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf Hiring of additional personnel to adequately segregate financial reporting duties.\n\u25cf The retention of outside consultants to review our controls and procedures\nA significant deficiency is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, that adversely affects the entitys ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the entitys financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected by the entitys internal control.\nA material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nGeneral Business Risks\nWe are highly dependent on the services of key executives, the loss of whom could materially harm our business and our strategic direction. If we lose key management or significant personnel, cannot recruit qualified employees, directors, officers, or other personnel or experience increases in our compensation costs, our business may materially suffer.\nWe are highly dependent on our management team, specifically Fredrick Cutcher, who we currently anticipate will be able to devote 25-30 hours per week to the Companys operations. If we lose key employees, our business may suffer. Furthermore, our future success will also depend in part on the continued service of our management personnel and our ability to identify, hire, and retain additional key personnel. We do not carry key-man life insurance on the lives of any of our executives, employees or advisors. We experience intense competition for qualified personnel and may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business. Because of this competition, our compensation costs may increase significantly.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to continue operations over the coming year.\nWe anticipate the need to raise approximately $1,000,000 in capital to fund our operations through June 30, 2024. We expect to use these cash proceeds, primarily to identify new business opportunities and possible acquisitions. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to raise these required funds or generate sufficient revenue to remain operational.\nWe may be unable to manage growth, which may impact our potential profitability.\nSuccessful implementation of our business strategy requires us to manage our growth. Growth could place an increasing strain on our management and financial resources. To manage growth effectively, we will need to:\n\u25cf Establish definitive business strategies, goals and objectives;\n\u25cf Maintain a system of management controls; and\n\u25cf Attract and retain qualified personnel, as well as, develop, train and manage management-level and other employees.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed, and our stock price may decline.\nOur lack of adequate D&O insurance may also make it difficult for us to retain and attract talented and skilled directors and officers.\nWe may in the future be subject to additional litigation, including potential class action and stockholder derivative actions. Risks associated with legal liability are difficult to assess and quantify, and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time. To date, we have not obtained directors and officers liability (D&O) insurance. While neither Delaware law nor our Articles of Incorporation or bylaws require us to indemnify or advance expenses to our officers and directors involved in such a legal action, we have entered into an indemnification agreement with our President and intend to enter into similar agreements with other officers and directors in the future. Without adequate D&O insurance, the amounts we would pay to indemnify our officers and directors should they be subject to legal action based on their service to the Company could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Furthermore, our lack of adequate D&O insurance may make it difficult for us to retain and attract talented and skilled directors and officers, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting, the reputational effects could materially adversely affect our business.\nUnder the provisions of Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended by the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to perform an evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Internal Controls) and to report on our evaluation in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our Internal Controls constitute a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In the event we discover material weakness in our internal controls and our remediation of such reported material weakness is ineffective, or if in the future we are unable to maintain effective Internal Controls, additional resulting material restatements could occur, regulatory actions could be taken, and a resulting loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements could occur.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. In addition, failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting and could harm our ability to manage our expenses.\nWe estimate that it will cost approximately $75,000 annually to maintain the proper management and financial controls for our filings required as a public reporting company. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause a decline in our stock price and adversely affect our ability to raise capital.\nIf the registration of our common stock is revoked in the future, our business opportunities will cease to exist.\nIn the event our securities registration was to be revoked, we would not have the ability to raise money through the issuance of shares and would lose the ability to continue the business plan set out in this filing. Common stock issued and outstanding at that time would no longer be tradable.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry-forwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have incurred substantial losses during our history. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporations ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards, or NOLs, and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nWe may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses, assets or properties, and any ability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow, divert the attention of key personnel, disrupt our business and impair our financial results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to consider acquisitions of companies, technologies and products. We may not be able to identify such attractive acquisition opportunities. Acquisitions, involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including, among other things:\n\u25cf difficulty in integrating the technologies, products, operations and existing contracts of a target company and realizing the anticipated benefits of the combined businesses;\n\u25cf mistaken assumptions about volumes or the timing of those volumes, revenues or costs, including synergies;\n\u25cf negative perception of the acquisition by customers, financial markets or investors;\n\u25cf difficulty in supporting and transitioning customers, if any, of the target company;\n\u25cf inability to achieve anticipated synergies or increase the revenue and profit of the acquired business;\n\u25cf the assumption of unknown liabilities;\n\u25cf exposure to potential lawsuits;\n\u25cf limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;\n\u25cf the diversion of managements and employees attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf unforeseen difficulties operating in new geographic areas;\n\u25cf customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses;\n\u25cf the price we pay or other resources that we devote may exceed the value we realize; or\n\u25cf the value we could have realized if we had allocated the purchase price or other resources to another opportunity and inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs.\nRisks Associated with the Acquisition of Fox Trott Tango, LLC\nRevenue from our properties, through the subsequent Fox Trott Tango acquisition, may be reduced or limited if the operations of our tenants are not successful.\nRevenue from our properties, through the subsequent Fox Trott Tango acquisition, depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis. Some of our leases provide for the payment, in addition to base rent, of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and generally provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property. Economic, legal, and/or competitive conditions, as well as COVID-19, may impact the success of our tenants retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants. Any reduction in our tenants abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent, or other charges on a timely basis, including the closing of stores prior to the end of the lease term or the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection, will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In the event of default by a tenant, we may experience delays and unexpected costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under lease terms, which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur net income depends on the success and continued presence of our anchor tenants.\nOur net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business, or the bankruptcy or insolvency, of any anchor tenant. Anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage, pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property. The closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by, or reductions in rent from, other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result. Over the past several years, we have seen higher levels of anchor turnover and closings in some markets, which has caused an oversupply of larger retail spaces. Therefore, tenant demand for certain of our anchor spaces may decrease and as a result, we may see an increase in vacancy and/or a decrease in rents for those spaces that could have a negative impact to our net income.\nWe have properties that are geographically concentrated, and adverse economic or real estate market declines in these areas could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAny adverse situation that disproportionately affects the markets where our properties are concentrated may have a magnified adverse effect on our portfolio. Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns, as they have been in the past, and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this market in both the short and long term.\nDeclines in the economy or a decline in the real estate market in these states could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties. Factors that may negatively affect economic conditions in these states include:\n\u25cf business layoffs or downsizing;\n\u25cf industry slowdowns;\n\u25cf elevated levels of inflation over an extended period of time;\n\u25cf increasing interest rates;\n\u25cf increased business restrictions due to health crises;\n\u25cf relocations of businesses;\n\u25cf changing demographics;\n\u25cf increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places;\n\u25cf infrastructure quality;\n\u25cf any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate;\n\u25cf concessions or reduced rental rates under new leases for properties where tenants defaulted; and\n\u25cf increased operating costs including insurance premiums and real estate taxes.\nWe may be unable to collect balances due from tenants that file for bankruptcy protection.\nIf a tenant or lease guarantor files for bankruptcy, we may not be able to collect all pre-petition amounts owed by that party. In addition, a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may terminate our lease in which event we would have a general unsecured claim that would likely be for less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or re-leasing space.\nWe derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants. We are subject to the risks that, upon expiration or termination of leases, whether by their terms, as a result of a tenant bankruptcy, general economic conditions or otherwise, leases for space in our properties may not be renewed, space may not be re-leased, or the terms of renewal or re-lease, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than current lease terms and may include decreases in rental rates. As a result, our net income could be reduced.\nOur performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry.\nOur economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently, the value of our investments, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected. As a company that invests in real estate, we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks:\n\u25cf economic downturns in general, or in the areas where our properties are located;\n\u25cf adverse changes in local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply or reduction in demand;\n\u25cf changes in tenant preferences that reduce the attractiveness of our properties to tenants;\n\u25cf zoning or regulatory restrictions;\n\u25cf decreases in market rental rates;\n\u25cf weather conditions that may increase or decrease energy costs and other weather-related expenses;\n\u25cf costs associated with the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-lease space; and\n\u25cf increases in the cost of adequate maintenance, insurance and other operating costs, including real estate taxes, associated with one or more properties, which may occur even when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in revenues from one or more properties, although real estate taxes typically do not increase upon a reduction in such revenues.\nEach of these risks could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nMany real estate costs are fixed, even if income from our properties decreases.\nOur financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us. Costs associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied, rental rates decrease, or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. As a result, cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms. Under those circumstances, we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs. Additionally, new properties that we may acquire or redevelop may not produce any significant revenue immediately, and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully occupied.\nCompetition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants.\nNumerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition. This competition may:\n\u25cf reduce properties available for acquisition;\n\u25cf increase the cost of properties available for acquisition;\n\u25cf reduce rents payable to us;\n\u25cf interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants;\n\u25cf lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties; and\n\u25cf adversely affect our ability to minimize expenses of operation.\nRisks Associated with Our Subsidiary, HMNRTH, LLC\nAll strains of cannabis other than hemp remain illegal under Federal law.\nDespite the development of a legal cannabis industry under the laws of certain states and the legalization of hemp under the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, the state laws legalizing medical and adult cannabis use are in conflict with the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which classifies cannabis as a Schedule-I controlled substance and makes cannabis use and possession illegal on a national level. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that the Federal government has the right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, even for medical purposes, and thus Federal law criminalizing the use of cannabis pre-empts state laws that legalize its use. However, the Obama Administration determined that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct Federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state laws allowing the use and distribution of medical and recreational cannabis. There is no guarantee that the current or any future Administration will not change the Federal governments stated policy regarding the low-priority enforcement of Federal laws in states where cannabis has been legalized. Any such change in the Federal governments enforcement of Federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us and our shareholders.\nWe recently entered the CBD Market and as a result, we are subject to numerous potential regulatory matters, which could negatively impact our operations.\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) which enforces the controlled substances laws of the United States has issued various rules and announcements concerning various items considered to be marijuana extracts which may encompass Cannabinoids. The uncertainty involves the extent to which the DEA will try to restrict the marketing or distribution of hemp finished/CBD products which we manufacture and distribute. If the DEA or other government agency were to take any action concerning our CBD products, it would have a negative impact on our revenues and financial condition.\nBecause we are subject to numerous laws and regulations, we could incur substantial costs.\nThe manufacture, labeling and distribution of our products is regulated by various federal, state and local agencies. These governmental authorities may commence regulatory or legal proceedings, which could restrict the permissible scope of our product claims or the ability to sell our products in the future. The FDA regulates our nutraceutical and wellness products to ensure that the products are not adulterated or misbranded.\nWe are subject to additional regulation as a result of our CBD products. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that we may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nFailure to comply with FDA requirements may result in, among other things, injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, product seizures, fines and criminal prosecutions. Our advertising is subject to regulation by the FTC under the FTCA. Additionally, some states also permit advertising and labeling laws to be enforced by private attorney generals, who may seek relief for consumers, seek class action certifications, seek class wide damages and product recalls of products sold by us. Any actions against us by governmental authorities or private litigants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLaws and regulations affecting the medical marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations.\nLocal, state and federal medical marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our proposed business. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business.\nUntil we have developed and launched our products at commercial levels, there is uncertainty of market acceptance and the efficacy of the commercialization strategy.\nWhile we have launched the sale of our CBD products on our ecommerce website, natural, hemp-based consumer products are new to the marketplace and it is not yet determined whether such products will gain consumer acceptance. Until we have consistent, proven sales, there is uncertainty of product acceptance in the intended markets and our ability to commercialize our products. As with any transformational product, there will be a time before customers embrace the product and recognize its full value. If there are no, or only low levels of, product acceptance and sales, we may have to alter our business plan. As is typical of any new business concept, demand and market acceptance for newly introduced products and services is subject to great uncertainty. Achieving market acceptance will require us to undertake substantial marketing efforts and to make significant expenditures to create awareness of and demand for our products. We have limited marketing experience and limited financial, personnel and other resources to undertake extensive marketing activities. Our efforts will be subject to all of the risks associated with the commercialization of new products, including unanticipated delays, expenses and the evolution of industry standards. There can be no assurance that markets for our products will not be limited, or that our strategies will result in successful product commercialization or in initial or continued market acceptance for our products.\nDue to controversy over the cannabis plant within the United States, we face challenges getting our products into stores.\nSome of our products are intended for ingestion purposes. There are potential significant health benefits to consuming hemp-based products, however, all products derived from the cannabis plant are controversial. Our products contain only trace amounts of THC and are below the legal limit for ingestion within the U.S. However, we anticipate that we may face scrutiny and experience resistance in getting our products into stores due to hesitation by food chains to carry any product even affiliated with the cannabis plant.\nWe face substantial risk of product liability claims and potential adverse product publicity.\nLike any other retailer, distributor or manufacturer of products that are designed to be ingested, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in injury. In the event we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification, product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company is not currently a named defendant in any product liability lawsuit; however, other manufacturers and distributors of nutritional supplements currently are or have been named as defendants in such lawsuits. The successful assertion or settlement of any uninsured claim, a significant number of insured claims, or a claim exceeding the Companys insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nGovernment regulation of cannabis and hemp is constantly evolving, and unfavorable developments could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nAny changes in laws or regulations relating to cannabis and hemp could adversely affect our business, results of operations and our business prospects.\nRisks Associated with Our Subsidiary, Markets on Main, LLC\nAn inability to develop and introduce products in a timely and cost-effective manner may damage our business.\nOur sales and profitability depend on our ability to bring products to market to meet customer demands and before consumers begin to lose interest in a given property. There is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a cost-effective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands. This risk is heightened by our customers increasingly compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business. Moreover, unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, manufacturing delays or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated, may reduce or eliminate the profitability of such products or, in some situations, may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued.\nOur success will depend on the reliability and performance of third-party distributors, manufacturers and suppliers.\nWe compete with other companies for the production capacity of third-party suppliers for components. Certain of these competing companies have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, and we may be at a competitive disadvantage in seeking to procure production capacity. Our inability to contract with third-party manufacturers and suppliers to provide a sufficient supply of our products on acceptable terms and on a timely basis could negatively impact our relationships with existing customers and cause us to lose revenue-generating opportunities with potential customers. We also rely on operators and distributors to market and distribute our products. If our operators or distributors are unsuccessful, we may miss revenue-generating opportunities that might otherwise have been recognized.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology, and potential cyberattacks, security problems or other disruption and expanding social media vehicles present new risks.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, billing and operating data. We may purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems will depend, and we rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential operator and other customer information. We depend upon the secure transmission of this information over public networks. Our networks and storage applications could be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or others through cyberattacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means, or may be breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. In some cases, it will be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause. Any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction, interruption or leakage of information from our systems could harm our reputation and business.\nIn addition, the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or information leakage. Negative posts or comments about us on any social networking website could damage our or our brands reputations. Employees or others might disclose non-public sensitive information relating to our business through external media channels, including through the use of social media. The continuing evolution of social media will present us with new challenges and risks.\nDefects in products we develop internally or for clients could reduce our revenue, increase our costs, burden our engineering and marketing resources, involve us in litigation and adversely affect us.\nOur success will depend on our ability to avoid, detect and correct defects in our products. We may not be able to maintain products that are free from defects. Although we have taken steps to prevent defects, our products could suffer such defects. The occurrence of such defects or malfunctions could result in physical harm to the patrons of our customers and the subsequent termination of agreements, cancellation of orders, product returns and diversion of our resources. Even if our customers do not suffer financial losses, customers may replace our products if they do not perform according to expectations. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and/or loss of sales. In addition, the occurrence of defects in our products may give rise to claims for lost revenues and related litigation by our customers and may subject us to investigation or other disciplinary action by regulatory authorities that could include suspension or revocation of our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to successfully manage our future inventories.\nWe must maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate our business successfully, but we must also avoid accumulating excess inventory, which increases working capital needs and lowers gross margin. We must typically order our CBD products well in advance of the time these products will be offered for sale to our customers. As a result, it may be difficult to respond to changes in consumer preferences and market conditions, which, for pop culture products, can change rapidly. If we do not accurately anticipate the popularity of certain products, then we may not have sufficient inventory to meet demand. Alternatively, if demand or future sales do not reach forecasted levels, we could have excess inventory that we may need to hold for a long period of time, write down, sell at prices lower than expected or discard. If we are not successful in managing our inventory, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may also be negatively affected by changes in retailers inventory policies and practices. As a result of the desire of retailers to more closely manage inventory levels, there is a growing trend to make purchases on a just-in-time basis. This requires us to more closely anticipate demand and could require us to carry additional inventory. Policies and practices of individual retailers may adversely affect us as well, including those relating to access to and time on shelf space, price demands, payment terms and favoring the products of our competitors. Our retail customers make no binding long-term commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders. Any retailer can therefore freely reduce its overall purchase of our products, including the number and variety of our products that it carries, and reduce the shelf space allotted for our products. If demand or future sales do not reach forecasted levels, we could have excess inventory that we may need to hold for a long period of time, write down, sell at prices lower than expected or discard. If we are not successful in managing our inventory, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAn inability to develop and introduce products in a timely and cost-effective manner may damage our business.\nOur sales and profitability for our CBD products depend on our ability to bring products to market to meet customer demands before consumers begin to lose interest in a given property. There is no guarantee that we will be able to source our manufacturing and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner or on a cost-effective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands. This risk is heightened by our customers increasingly compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business. These time constraints may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk. Moreover, unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, manufacturing or distribution delays or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands, or the related third party content, may cause the introduction date for new CBD products to be later than anticipated, may reduce or eliminate the profitability of such products or, in some situations, may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued.\nRisk to Our Common Stock\nIf we fail to remain current on our reporting requirements, we could be removed from the OTC Bulletin Board which would limit the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities in the secondary market.\nCompanies trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board must be reporting issuers under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and must be current in their reports under Section 13, in order to maintain price quotation privileges on the OTC Bulletin Board. As a result, the market liquidity for our securities could be severely adversely affected by limiting the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market. In addition, we may be unable to get relisted on the OTC Bulletin Board, which may have an adverse material effect on the Company.\nRestrictions on the Use of Rule 144 by Shell Companies or Former Shell Companies\nRule 144 is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by shell companies (other than business combination related shell companies) or issuers that have been at any time previously a shell company. However, Rule 144 also includes an important exception to this prohibition if the following conditions are met:\n\u25cf the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company;\n\u25cf the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;\n\u25cf the issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and materials required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Current Reports on Form 8-K; and\n\u25cf at least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company.\nAt the present time, the Company is not classified as a shell company under Rule 405 of the Securities Act.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the future; any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting it at such time as the board of directors may consider relevant. Our current intention is to apply net earnings, if any, in the foreseeable future to increasing our capital base and development and marketing efforts. There can be no assurance that the Company will ever have sufficient earnings to declare and pay dividends to the holders of our common stock, and in any event, a decision to declare and pay dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if its stock price appreciates.\nAuthorization of preferred stock.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time to time by its Board of Directors. Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting, or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock. On July 16, 2019, the Companys Board of Directors approved the designation of two new series of preferred stock, Series K Super Voting Preferred Stock (3 shares authorized) and Series L Preferred Stock (500,000 shares authorized).\nWe have authorized 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock with 294 and 276 shares outstanding at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In the event of issuance of additional shares, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. Please see NOTE J - CAPITAL STOCK for further information.\nThe market price for our common stock may be particularly volatile given our status as a relatively unknown company, with a limited operating history and lack of profits which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. You may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price, which may result in substantial losses to you.\nOur stock price may be particularly volatile when compared to the shares of larger, more established companies that trade on a national securities exchange and have large public floats. The volatility in our share price will be attributable to a number of factors. First, our common stock will be compared to the shares of such larger, more established companies, sporadically and thinly traded. As a consequence of this limited liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our shareholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction. The price for our shares could decline precipitously in the event that a large number of shares of our common stock are sold on the market without commensurate demand. Second, we are a speculative or risky investment due to our limited operating history and lack of profits to date, and uncertainty of future market acceptance for our potential products. As a consequence of this enhanced risk, more risk-adverse investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress, be more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a larger, more established company that trades on a national securities exchange and has a large public float. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common stock will be at any time. Moreover, the OTC Bulletin Board is not a liquid market in contrast to the major stock exchanges. We cannot assure you as to the liquidity or the future market prices of our common stock if a market does develop. If an active market for our common stock does not develop, the fair market value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.\nExisting stockholders will experience significant dilution from our sale of shares under potential Securities Purchase Agreements.\nThe sale of shares pursuant to any Securities Purchase Agreements executed by the Company in the future will have a dilutive impact on our stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly, as we sell shares pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement. In addition, for any particular advance, we will need to issue a greater number of shares of common stock under the Securities Purchase Agreement as our stock price declines. If our stock price is lower, then our existing stockholders would experience greater dilution.\nThe Company May Issue Shares of Preferred Stock with Greater Rights than Common Stock.\nThe Companys charter authorizes the Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from holders of the Companys common stock. Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of the Companys common stock in terms of dividends, priority and liquidation premiums and may have greater voting rights than the Companys common stock.\nBeing a Public Company Significantly Increases the Companys Administrative Costs.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and listing requirements subsequently adopted by the NYSE Amex in response to Sarbanes-Oxley, have required changes in corporate governance practices, internal control policies and audit committee practices of public companies. Although the Company is a relatively small public company, these rules, regulations, and requirements for the most part apply to the same extent as they apply to all major publicly traded companies. As a result, they have significantly increased the Companys legal, financial, compliance and administrative costs, and have made certain other activities more time consuming and costly, as well as requiring substantial time and attention of our senior management. The Company expects its continued compliance with these and future rules and regulations to continue to require significant resources. These rules and regulations also may make it more difficult and more expensive for the Company to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future and could make it more difficult for it to attract and retain qualified members for the Companys Board of Directors, particularly to serve on its audit committee.\nOur shares are subject to the U.S. Penny Stock Rules and investors who purchase our shares may have difficulty re-selling their shares as the liquidity of the market for our shares may be adversely affected by the impact of the Penny Stock Rules.\nOur stock is subject to U.S. Penny Stock rules, which may make the stock more difficult to trade on the open market. Our common shares are not currently traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, but it is the Companys plan that the common shares be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. A penny stock is generally defined by regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as an equity security with a market price of less than US$5.00 per share. However, an equity security with a market price under US $5.00 will not be considered a penny stock if it fits within any of the following exceptions:\n(i) the equity security is listed on NASDAQ or a national securities exchange;\n(ii) the issuer of the equity security has been in continuous operation for less than three years, and either has (a) net tangible assets of at least US $5,000,000, or (b) average annual revenue of at least US $6,000,000; or\n(iii) the issuer of the equity security has been in continuous operation for more than three years and has net tangible assets of at least US $2,000,000.\nOur common stock does not currently fit into any of the above exceptions.\nIf an investor buys or sells a penny stock, SEC regulations require that the investor receive, prior to the transaction, a disclosure explaining the penny stock market and associated risks. Furthermore, trading in our common stock will be subject to Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act, which relates to non-NASDAQ and non-exchange listed securities. Under this rule, broker/dealers who recommend our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to a transaction prior to sale. Securities are exempt from this rule if their market price is at least $5.00 per share. Since our common stock is currently deemed penny stock regulations, it may tend to reduce market liquidity of our common stock, because they limit the broker/dealers ability to trade, and a purchasers ability to sell, the stock in the secondary market.\nThe low price of our common stock has a negative effect on the amount and percentage of transaction costs paid by individual shareholders. The low price of our common stock also limits our ability to raise additional capital by issuing additional shares. There are several reasons for these effects. First, the internal policies of certain institutional investors prohibit the purchase of low-priced stocks. Second, many brokerage houses do not permit low-priced stocks to be used as collateral for margin accounts or to be purchased on margin. Third, some brokerage house policies and practices tend to discourage individual brokers from dealing in low-priced stocks. Finally, brokers commissions on low-priced stocks usually represent a higher percentage of the stock price than commissions on higher priced stocks. As a result, the Companys shareholders may pay transaction costs that are a higher percentage of their total share value than if our share price were substantially higher.\nBecause we can issue additional shares of common stock, purchasers of our common stock may incur immediate dilution and experience further dilution.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 14,991,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 14,488,440,097 and 13,785,662,319 shares of common stock are issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Our Board of Directors has the authority to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares, without consent of any of our stockholders. Consequently, the stockholders may experience more dilution in their ownership of our stock in the future. Please see NOTE - J CAPITAL STOCK for further information.\nA reverse stock split may decrease the liquidity of the shares of our common stock.\nThe liquidity of the shares of our common stock may be affected adversely by a reverse stock split given the reduced number of shares that will be outstanding following a reverse stock split, especially if the market price of our common stock does not increase as a result of the reverse stock split.\nFollowing a reverse stock split, the resulting market price of our common stock may not attract new investors, including institutional investors, and may not satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. Consequently, the trading liquidity of our common stock may not improve.\nAlthough we believe that a higher market price of our common stock may help generate greater or broader investor interest, we cannot assure you that a reverse stock split will result in a share price that will attract new investors.\nYou may be diluted by conversions of the Companys convertible notes and future conversions of the Companys Series L Preferred Stock.\nAs of June 30, 2023, we had (i) outstanding Convertible Promissory Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $390,000, which are convertible for up to 6,900,000,000 shares of our Class A Common Stock based on a closing stock price of $0.0002 at June 30, 2023 and inherent conversion features; and (ii) 294 shares of Series L Preferred Stock outstanding, which are convertible into 14,497,440,097 shares of our Class A Common Stock based on the inherent conversion feature.\nThe conversion of the Convertible Promissory Notes and Series L Preferred Stock will result in further dilution of your investment. In addition, you may experience additional dilution if we issue common stock in the future. As a result of this dilution, you may receive significantly less in net tangible book value than the full purchase price you paid for the shares in the event of liquidation. As of the date of this filing, the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized but unissued shares to issue in the event our noteholders and the holder of our Series L Preferred stock were to elect to convert into shares of our Class A Common Stock. The Company may be required to file an Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Class A Common Stock or to effect a reverse stock split to satisfy the requested conversions.\nIssuances of shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of common stock following this offering, will dilute your ownership interests and may adversely affect the future market price of our common stock.\nThe issuance of additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock could be dilutive to stockholders if they do not invest in future offerings. We may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public offerings in the future.\nThe Companys shares of common stock are quoted on the OTC Pink Sheet market, which limits the liquidity and price of the Companys common stock.\nThe Companys shares of Common Stock are traded on the OTC Pink Sheet market under the symbol GTLL. Quotation of the Companys securities on the OTC Pink Sheet market limits the liquidity and price of the Companys Common Stock more than if the Companys shares of Common Stock were listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market or a national exchange. There is currently no active trading market in the Companys Common Stock. There can be no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Companys Common Stock following a business combination. In the event that an active trading market commences, there can be no assurance as to the market price of the Companys shares of Common Stock, whether any trading market will provide liquidity to investors, or whether any trading market will be sustained.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our stock.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) has adopted rules requiring that, in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative or low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA has indicated its belief that there is a high probability that speculative or low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. If these FINRA requirements are applicable to us or our securities, they may make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that at least some of their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the ability of our stockholders to buy and sell our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market for and price of our common stock.\nWe are classified as a smaller reporting company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a smaller reporting company. Specifically, smaller reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings.\nCautionary Note\nWe have sought to identify what we believe to be the most significant risks to our business, but we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, any of such risks may be realized nor can we guarantee that we have identified all possible risks that might arise. Investors should carefully consider all of such risk factors before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item. Item 2. Properties.\nOur principal executive office is located at 8 Campus Drive, Suite 105 Parsippany, New Jersey 07054 and our telephone number is (973) 233-5151. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nFrom time to time, we may be a defendant and plaintiff in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business. We are currently not a party to any material pending legal proceedings or government actions, including any bankruptcy, receivership, or similar proceedings. In addition, management is not aware of any known litigation or liabilities involving the operators of our properties that could affect our operations. Should any liabilities be incurred in the future, they will be accrued based on managements best estimate of the potential loss. As such, there is no adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow at this time. Furthermore, Management of the Company does not believe that there are any proceedings to which any director, officer, or affiliate of the Company, any owner of record of the beneficially or more than five percent of the common stock of the Company, or any associate of any such director, officer, affiliate of the Company, or security holder is a party adverse to the Company or has a material interest adverse to the Company. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is quoted under the symbol GTLL on the OTC Markets PINK. The following information reflects the high and low closing prices of the Companys common stock on the OTC Markets PINK.\nQuarterly period\nLow\nHigh\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2023:\nFirst Quarter\n$ 0.0002\n$ 0.0005\nSecond Quarter\n$ 0.0001\n$ 0.0003\nThird Quarter\n$ 0.0001\n$ 0.0002\nFourth Quarter\n$ 0.0001\n$ 0.0004\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2022:\nFirst Quarter\n$ 0.0015\n$ 0.0044\nSecond Quarter\n$ 0.0003\n$ 0.0042\nThird Quarter\n$ 0.0003\n$ 0.0019\nFourth Quarter\n$ 0.0002\n$ 0.0005\nHolders of Record\nThe Company had approximately 149 holders of record of our Class A Common Stock as of December 27, 2023.\nDividends\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock, and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nThe Company does not currently maintain any Equity Compensation Plans.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities, Uses of Proceeds from Registered Securities and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nWe claimed exemption from registration under the Securities Act for the sales and issuances of securities in the following transactions under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder, in that such sales and issuances did not involve a public offering, or under Rule 701 promulgated under the Securities Act, in that they were offered and sold either pursuant to written compensatory plans or pursuant to a written contract relating to compensation, as provided by Rule 701. All of the purchasers of unregistered securities for which we relied on Section 4(a)(2) and/or Regulation D represented that they were accredited investors as defined under the Securities Act. We claimed such exemption on the basis that (a) the purchasers in each case represented that they intended to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view to the distribution thereof and that they either received adequate information about the registrant or had access, through employment or other relationships, to such information and (b) appropriate legends were affixed to the stock certificates issued in such transactions.\nClass A Common Stock:\nYear ended June 30, 2023\nOn July 14, 2022, the Company issued 111,111,111 shares of common stock with a fair market value of $33,333 to a noteholder in satisfaction of $20,000 principal against the note dated January 13, 2022.\nOn July 15, 2022, the Company issued 212,500,000 shares of common stock with a fair market value of $63,750 to a noteholder in satisfaction of $23,750 principal and $1,750 interest against the note dated January 13, 2022.\nOn August 8, 2022, the Company issued 379,166,667 shares of common stock with a fair market value of $113,750 to a noteholder in satisfaction of $43,750 principal and $1,750 interest against the note dated February 4, 2022.\nYear ended June 30, 2022\nOn November 17, 2021, the Company issued 40,070,137 shares of common stock with a fair market value of $144,252 to a noteholder in satisfaction of $16,500 principal and $3,535 interest against the note dated December 17, 2019.\nOn November 17, 2021, the Company issued 126,674,824 shares of common stock with a fair market value of $456,029 for a cashless exercise of a warrant.\nOn December 22, 2021, the Company issued 55,000,000 shares of common stock with a fair market value of $110,000 to a noteholder in satisfaction of $68,750 principal and $2,750 interest against the note dated June 17, 2021.\nOn January 18, 2022, the Company issued 55,108,596 shares of common stock with a fair market value of $93,685 to a noteholder in satisfaction of $48,750 principal and $1,950 interest against the note dated July 12, 2021.\nOn March 3, 2022, the Company issued 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a fair market value of $650,000 to an Accredited Investor (the Investor) to replace shares of common stock the Investor had returned to the Company in prior periods.\nOn March 3, 2022, the Company issued 600,000,000 shares of common stock with a fair market value of $780,000 to an Accredited Investor (the Investor) to replace shares of common stock the Investor had returned to the Company in prior periods.\nOn March 15, 2022, the Company issued 163,548,387 shares of common stock with a fair market value of $81,774 to a noteholder in satisfaction of $48,750 principal and $1,950 interest against the note dated September 9, 2021.\nOn April 29, 2022, the Company issued 335,833,333 shares of common stock with a fair market value of $67,167 to a noteholder in satisfaction of $38,750 principal and $1,550 interest against the note dated October 27, 2021.\nCommon Stock cancelled during the year ended June 30, 2022\nA total of 390,000,000 shares of common stock were returned to the Company by shareholders during the year ended June 30, 2022.\nOn October 18, 2021, a Default Final Judgment was entered in favor of the Company in the Complaint for Declaratory Judgment filed with the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida against Fortis Holdings, Ltd, Wayfarer Management, Ltd, Flash Funding, Inc. and OTC Capital Partners, LLC. A total of 2,991,000,000 shares of the Companys issued and outstanding common stock were voided.\nWarrants:\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company had no outstanding warrants.\nPenny Stock\nPenny Stock Regulation Broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks are regulated by certain penny stock rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. Excluded from the penny stock designation are securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on NASDAQ, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange/system or sold to established customers or accredited investors.\nThe penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in connection with the transaction, and the monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction.\nThese disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. As our securities have become subject to the penny stock rules, investors may find it more difficult to sell their securities. Item 6. Selected Financial Data\nNot required for smaller reporting company. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contain forward-looking statements that are based upon current expectations and involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties.\nOur Managements Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words that, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this prospectus. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions. These risks and uncertainties include international, national, and local general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; change in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; the risk of foreign currency exchange rate; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus.\nAlthough the forward-looking statements in this annual report on Form 10-K reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in herein and in our other reports as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.\nOur financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (USD or US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. All references to common stock refer to the common shares in our capital stock.\nFinancing Needs\nIn order to fund our operations, we rely upon direct investments, partnerships and joint ventures with accredited investors. Once the Company becomes profitable, we intend to fund our operations from free cash flow.\nAt present, the Company only has sufficient funds to conduct its operations for two to three months. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.\nIf we are not successful in generating sufficient liquidity from Company operations or in raising sufficient capital resources, on terms acceptable to us, this could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations liquidity and financial condition.\nThe Company presently does not have any available credit, bank financing or other external sources of liquidity. Due to its brief history under its current business model and historical operating losses, the Companys operations have not been a source of liquidity. The Company will need to obtain additional capital in order to expand operations and become profitable. In order to obtain capital, the Company may need to sell additional shares of its common stock or borrow funds from private lenders. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining additional funding.\nThe Company will need additional investments in order to continue operations. Additional investments are being sought, but the Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to obtain such investments. Financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. In the event there is a downturn in the U.S. stock and debt markets, this could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities. Even if the Company is able to raise the funds required, it is possible that it could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to it, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force it to seek alternative financing. Further, if the Company issues additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders.\nResults from Operations\nOur results of operations for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 are summarized below:\nJune 30, 2023 June 30, 2022\nGross revenues $ 17,000 $ 124,506\nCost of goods sold - 13,000\nTotal Operating expenses 540,212 610,794\nLoss from Operations (523,212 ) (499,288 )\nOther income (expense) (510,828\n) (779,027 )\nNet Loss (1,034,040 ) (1,278,315 )\nNet loss per share- basic and diluted $ (0.00 ) $ (0.00 )\nRevenues\nSince our inception on January 20, 1999, we have generated minimal revenue from our operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. We have limited financial resources and limited operations until such time that we are able to begin to generate revenue from our own operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business plan through the subsequent acquisition of Fox Trott Tango, LLC, including the financial risks associated with the limited capital resources currently available to us and risks associated with the implementation of our business strategies.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we generated $17,000 and $124,506 in revenue, respectively. Our revenue for the year ended June 30, 2023 was entirely comprised from consulting services. Our revenue for the year ended June 30, 2022 was comprised of consulting services and sales of Sculptbaby products. We do not anticipate generating any further revenue from the sale of Sculptbaby products.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, our cost of goods sold was $0 and $13,000, respectively. The makeup of the cost of goods sold for the year ended June 30, 2022 was 100% comprised of costs for the sale of the Companys Sculpt Baby product.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses were $540,212 and $610,794 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2023 is largely attributable to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and consulting services.\nWe incurred $0 and $0 in advertising expenses for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nWe incurred $378,634 and $328,237 in officer and director related compensation for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLoss from Operations\nThe Companys loss from operations increased to ($523,212) for the year ended June 30, 2023 from ($499,288) for the year ended June 30, 2022, an increase of $23,924. The increase in loss from operations is largely attributable to an increase in officer and director compensation and professional services.\nOther Income (Expenses)\nOther income (expenses) were ($510,828) for the year ended June 30, 2023 versus ($779,027) for the year ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in other expenses for the year ended June 30, 2023 is largely attributable to a decrease in amortization of debt discount expense and no impairment of goodwill or loss on issuance of convertible notes as compared to the year ended June 30, 2022.\nNet (loss)\nFor the year ended June 30, 2023, our net loss decreased to ($1,034,040), as compared to a net loss of ($1,278,315) for the year ended June 30, 2022, a decrease of $244,275. The decrease in net loss is largely attributable to the Companys decrease in other income (expenses).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash on Hand\nOur cash on hand as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, was $18,300 and $324,494, respectively.\nWe currently have no external sources of liquidity such as arrangements with credit institutions or off-balance sheet arrangements that will have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or immediate access to capital.\nWe are dependent on the sale of our securities or issuance of debt to fund our operations and will remain so until we generate sufficient revenues to pay for our operating costs. Our officers and directors have made no written commitments with respect to providing a source of liquidity in the form of cash advances, loans and/or financial guarantees.\nIf we are unable to raise the funds, we will seek alternative financing through means such as borrowings from institutions or private individuals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the capital we need for our operations from the sale of our securities. We have not located any sources for these funds and may not be able to do so in the future. We expect that we will seek additional financing in the future. However, we may not be able to obtain additional capital or generate sufficient revenues to fund our operations. If we are unsuccessful at raising sufficient funds, for whatever reason, to fund our operations, we may be forced to cease operations. If we fail to raise funds, we expect that we will be required to seek protection from creditors under applicable bankruptcy laws.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and believes that our ability is dependent on our ability to implement our business plan, raise capital and generate revenues. Please see NOTE M- GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY for further information.\nNotes payable, third parties\nOur Notes payable third parties were $390,000 and $387,500 as of June 30, 2023, and June 30, 2022, respectively. Please see NOTE H - NOTES PAYABLE, THIRD PARTIES for a full schedule of all notes payable to third parties, including issue date, maturity date and interest rate.\nLoans payable, related parties\nOur loans payable, related party was $2,250 and $2,250 as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively.\nOur cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 are summarized below:\nYear Ended\nJune 30, 2023\nYear Ended\nJune 30, 2022\nCash (used in) provided by:\nOperating activities\n$ (392,437 )\n$ (484,410 )\nInvesting activities\n(15,000 )\n(350,000 )\nFinancing activities\n101,243\n1,102,604\nNet increase (decrease) in Cash\n$ (306,194 )\n$ 268,194\nUse of Cash\nWe had net cash (used in) operating activities for the years ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 of ($392,437) and ($484,410), respectively.\nWe had net cash (used in) investing activities for the years ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 of ($15,000) and ($350,000), respectively.\nWe had net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 of $101,243 and $1,102,604, respectively. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nFinancial Statements\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 5525)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders (Deficiency) for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nto\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Global Technologies, Ltd.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global Technologies, Ltd. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders (deficiency), and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note M to the financial statements, the Company has a history of net losses, an accumulated deficit, and negative cash flows from operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note M. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nPotential Discontinued Operations - Refer to Notes A and N to the Financial Statements\nThe Company has several subsidiaries with varied business operations and acquired additional companies subsequent to June 30, 2023. There is potential that one or more of the subsidiaries during the year under audit may have discontinued operations which would require additional disclosures and may materially impact the presentation on the financial statements. Determination of the status of the subsidiaries operations is potentially subject to judgment and estimation.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. These procedures included:\n\u25cf Review of underlying agreements and documentation for evidence that deconsolidation, assets are held for sale, or abandonment has occurred.\n\u25cf Determination if it appears reasonable that the entities and related assets are available for future operations.\n\u25cf Assessment of any potential material impact to the financial statements and related disclosures in the qualitative or quantitative sense.\nFruci & Associates II, PLLC -

Accordingly, they do not contain all information and footnotes required by GAAP for annual financial statements. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of the Companys management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and the results of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the periods presented.\nAs of June 30, 2023, Global Technologies had five wholly owned subsidiaries: TCBM Holdings, LLC (TCBM), HMNRTH, LLC (HMNRTH), 911 Help Now, LLC (911), Markets on Main, LLC (MOM) and Tersus Power, Inc. (Tersus). As of June 30, 2023, the Company had a minority investment in one entity, Global Clean Solutions, LLC.\nNOTE C - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThis summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is presented to assist in understanding the Companys financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Companys management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Global Technologies and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCash Equivalents\nInvestments having an original maturity of 90 days or less that are readily convertible into cash are considered to be cash equivalents. For the periods presented, the Company had no cash equivalents. The Company has cash on deposit at one financial institution which, at times, may be in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance limits. The Company has not experienced losses in such accounts and periodically evaluates the creditworthiness of its financial institutions. In the future, the Company may reduce its credit risk by placing its cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions. The Company had approximately $18,300 of cash and cash equivalents on June 30, 2023 of which none was held in foreign bank accounts and $0 was not covered by FDIC insurance limits as of June 30, 2023.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:\nAccounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amount and generally do not bear interest. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established, as necessary, based on past experience and other factors which, in managements judgment, deserve current recognition in estimating bad debts. Such factors include growth and composition of accounts receivable, the relationship of the allowance for doubtful accounts to accounts receivable and current economic conditions. The determination of the collectability of amounts due from customer accounts requires the Company to make judgments regarding future events and trends. Allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on assessing the Companys portfolio on an individual customer and on an overall basis. This process consists of a review of historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts, and the financial condition of Global Technologies customers. Based on a review of these factors, the Company establishes or adjusts the allowance for specific customers and the accounts receivable portfolio as a whole.\nAccounts receivable - related party and allowance for doubtful accounts\nAccounts receivable - related party are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses. The Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes general and specific allowances when there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances. In evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances, the Company considers many factors, including the age of the balance, a customers historical payment history, its current creditworthiness and current economic trends. Accounts are written off after exhaustive efforts at collection.\nConcentrations of Risks\nConcentration of Accounts Receivable - On June 30, 2023, the Company had $- in accounts receivable. At June 30, 2023, the Company elected to write-off $5,000 in accounts receivable from one client the Company was providing consulting services. On June 30, 2022, the Company had $5,000 in accounts receivable.\nConcentration of Revenues - For the year ended June 30, 2023, one customer accounted for 100% of the Companys revenue. For the year ended June 30, 2022, two customers accounted for approximately 20% of the Companys revenue each.\nGLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES, LTD\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nNOTE C - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (contd)\nConcentration of Suppliers - The Company relies on a limited number of suppliers and contract manufacturers.

On June 30, 2022, one borrower accounted for 100% of the Companys total notes receivable. Please see NOTE F - NOTE RECEIVABLE for further information.\nIncome Taxes\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740 - Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method measures deferred income taxes by applying enacted statutory rates in effect at the balance sheet date to the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts on the financial statements. The resulting deferred tax assets or liabilities are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws as they occur. A valuation allowance is provided when it is not more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized.\nWe expect to recognize the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position only after considering the probability that a tax authority would sustain the position in an examination. For tax positions meeting a more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount to be recognized in the financial statements will be the benefit expected to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority. For tax positions not meeting the threshold, no financial statement benefit is recognized. As of June 30, 2023, we had no uncertain tax positions. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions as general and administrative expenses. We currently have no federal or state tax examinations nor have we had any federal or state examinations since our inception. To date, we have not incurred any interest or tax penalties.\nFinancial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe adopted ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC Topic 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing US GAAP that requires the use of fair value measurements that establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements.\nASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC Topic 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entitys own assumptions.\nThe carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. Except for the derivative liability, we had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis during the periods presented.\nDerivative Liabilities\nWe evaluate convertible notes payable, stock options, stock warrants and other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under the relevant sections of ASC Topic 815-40, Derivative Instruments and Hedging: Contracts in Entitys Own Equity.\nThe result of this accounting treatment could be that the fair value of a financial instrument is classified as a derivative instrument and is marked-to-market at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or other expense. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. Financial instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC Topic 815-40 are reclassified to a liability account at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. Please see NOTE I - DERIVATIVE LIABILITY for further information.\nGLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES, LTD\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nNOTE C - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (contd)\nLong-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment. We test for impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Impairment evaluations involve managements estimates on asset useful lives and future cash flows. Actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management which could have a material effect on our reporting results and financial positions. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.\nAccounting for Investments - The Company accounts for investments based upon the type and nature of the investment and the availability of current information to determine its value. Investments in marketable securities in which there is a trading market will be valued at market value on the nearest trading date relative to the Companys financial reporting requirements. Investments in which there is no trading market from which to obtain recent pricing and trading data for valuation purposes will be valued based upon managements review of available financial information, disclosures related to the investment and recent valuations related to the investments fundraising efforts.\nMarketable Equity Securities\nMarketable equity securities are stated at lower of cost or market value with unrealized gains and losses included in operations. The Company has classified its marketable equity securities as trading securities.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nDeferred financing costs represent costs incurred in the connection with obtaining debt financing. These costs are amortized ratably and charged to financing expenses over the term of the related debt.\nRevenue recognition\nGenerally, the Company considers all revenues as arising from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized based on the five-step process outlined in the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606:\nStep 1 - Identify the Contract with the Customer - A contract exists when (a) the parties to the contract have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations, (b) the entity can identify each partys rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred, (c) the entity can identify the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred, (d) the contract has commercial substance and it is probably that the entity will collect substantially all of the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.\nStep 2 - Identify Performance Obligations in the Contract - Upon execution of a contract, the Company identifies as performance obligations each promise to transfer to the customer either (a) goods or services that are distinct, or (b) a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods or services, the Company must apply judgement to determine whether the goods or services are capable of being distinct within the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\nStep 3 - Determine the Transaction Price - When (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, the Company shall recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the performance obligation. The contract terms are used to determine the transaction price. Generally, all contracts include fixed consideration. If a contract did include variable consideration, the Company would determine the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price based on expected value method. Variable consideration would be included in the transaction price, if in the Companys judgement, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract would not occur.\nStep 4 - Allocate the Transaction Price - After the transaction price has been determined, the next step is to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract. If the contract only has one performance obligation, the entire transaction price will be applied to that obligation. If the contract has multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations based on the relative standalone selling price (SSP) at contract inception.\nStep 5 - Satisfaction of the Performance Obligations (and Recognize Revenue) - Revenue is recognized when (or as) goods or services are transferred to a customer. The Company satisfies each of its performance obligations by transferring control of the promised good or service underlying that performance obligation to the customer. Control is the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from an asset. It includes the ability to prevent other entities from directing the use of and obtaining the benefits from an asset. Indicators that control has passed to the customer include: a present obligation to pay; physical possession of the asset; legal title; risks and rewards of ownership; and acceptance of the asset(s). Performance obligations can be satisfied at a point in time or overtime.\nSubstantially all of the Companys revenues continue to be recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which is upon shipment of the finished goods to the customer. All sales have fixed pricing and there are currently no material variable components included in the Companys revenue. Additionally, the Company will issue credits for defective merchandise, historically these credits for defective merchandise have not been material. Based on the Companys analysis of the new revenue standards, revenue recognition from the sale of finished goods to customers, which represents substantially all of the Companys revenues, was not impacted by the adoption of the new revenue standards.\nService revenue is recognized when the professional consulting, maintenance or other ancillary services are provided to the customer.\nGLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES, LTD\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nNOTE C - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (contd)\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for share-based awards to employees in accordance with ASC 718 Stock Compensation. Under this guidance, stock compensation expense is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the estimated service period (generally the vesting period) on the straight-line attribute method. The Company accounts for non-employee stock-based awards in accordance with the Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Under the new standard, the Company will value all equity classified awards at their grant-date under ASC718 and no options were required to be revalued at adoption.\nRelated Parties\nA party is considered to be related to us if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with us. Related parties also include our principal owners, our management, members of the immediate families of our principal owners and our management and other parties with which we may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties, or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests, is also a related party.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. For the periods presented, we had no advertising costs.\nLoss per Share\nWe compute net loss per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260. The ASC specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for loss per share for entities with publicly held common stock.\nBasic loss per share amounts are computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive securities (such as stock options, warrants and convertible securities) outstanding. Dilutive securities having an anti-dilutive effect on diluted net loss per share are excluded from the calculation. For the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company excluded 21,900,000,000 and 3,717,213,115, respectively, shares relating to convertible notes payable to third parties and shares issuable upon conversion of the Companys Series L Preferred stock.\nGLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES, LTD\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nNOTE C - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (contd)\nRecently Enacted Accounting Standards\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13). Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) amends guideline on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, Topic 326 eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. For available-for-sale debt securities, credit losses should be measured in a manner similar to current GAAP, however Topic 326 will require that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. ASU 2016-13 affects entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. The amendments in this ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our financial statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). This ASU reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. As well as amend the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entitys own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. In addition, this ASU improves and amends the related EPS guidance. This standard is effective for us on May 1, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption is either a modified retrospective method or a fully retrospective method of transition. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on our financial statements.\nManagement has evaluated other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe that any of these pronouncements will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. Financial instruments included in the Companys financial statements include cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, accrued interest payable, loans payable to related parties, notes payable to third parties, notes payable to related parties and derivative liability. Unless otherwise disclosed in the notes to the financial statements, the carrying value of financial instruments is considered to approximate fair value due to the short maturity and characteristics of those instruments. The carrying value of debt approximates fair value as terms approximate those currently available for similar debt instruments.\nGoodwill\nAfter completing the purchase price allocation, any residual of cost over fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities was assigned to the unidentifiable asset, goodwill. Formerly subject to mandatory amortization, this now is not permitted to be amortized at all, by any allocation scheme and over any useful life. Impairment testing, using a methodology at variance with that set forth in FAS 144 (which, however, continues in effect for all other types of long-lived assets and intangibles other than goodwill), must be applied periodically, and any computed impairment will be presented as a separate line item in that periods income statement, as a component of income from continuing operations (unless associated with discontinued operations, in which case, the impairment would, net of income tax effects, be combined with the remaining effects of the discontinued operations. In accordance with Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Company does not amortize goodwill, but performs impairment tests of the carrying value on a semi-annual and annual basis.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are stated at the lesser of cost or fair value. Please see NOTE D - ACQUISITION OF TCBM HOLDINGS, LLC for further information.\nGLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES, LTD\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nNOTE D - ACQUISITION OF TCBM HOLDINGS, LLC\nOn November 30, 2019, the Company acquired 100% ownership of TCBM Holdings, LLC (TCBM) and TCBMs two wholly owned subsidiaries, HMNRTH, LLC and 911 Help Now, LLC. The combination has been accounted for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as an acquisition transaction. Accordingly, the financial position and results of operation of the Company prior to November 30, 2019 has been excluded from the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company acquired a 100% interest in exchange for a Convertible Promissory Note in the amount of $2,000,000.\nDetails regarding the book values and fair values of the net assets acquired are as follows:\nSCHEDULE OF FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED\nBook Value Fair Value Difference\nCash $ 546,411 $ 546,411 $ -\nInventory 70,580 70,580 -\nProperty and Equipment 36,363 36,363 -\nTotal $ 653,354 $ 653,354 $ -\nGoodwill and Intangibles\nGoodwill is recorded when the cost of acquired businesses exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Intangible assets other than goodwill are recorded at fair value at the time acquired or at cost, if applicable. Intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized in line with the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed. If the pattern of economic benefit cannot be reliably determined, the intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the legal or estimated life. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter using the same dates each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment.\nIn performing the annual impairment test, the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. For goodwill, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative test is required only if the Company concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount. For quantitative testing, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nFair values are determined using established business valuation techniques and models developed by the Company, estimates of market participant assumptions of future cash flows, future growth rates and discount rates to value estimated cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions, actual growth below the assumed market participant assumptions or an increase in the discount rate could result in an impairment charge in a future period.\nAcquisitions\nUpon acquisition of a business, the Company uses the income, market or cost approach (or a combination thereof) for the valuation as appropriate. The valuation inputs in these models and analyses are based on market participant assumptions. Market participants are considered to be buyers and sellers unrelated to the Company in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\nFair value estimates are based on a series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. Management values property, plant and equipment using the cost approach supported where available by observable market data, which includes consideration of obsolescence. Management values acquired intangible assets using the relief from royalty method or excess earnings method, forms of the income approach supported by observable market data for peer companies. The significant assumptions used to estimate the value of the acquired intangible assets include discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of future cash flows (such as revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and royalty rates). Acquired inventories are marked to fair value for valuation of the total purchase price. For certain items, the carrying value is determined to be a reasonable approximation of fair value based on information available to the Company.\nSCHEDULE OF ASSETS ACQUIRED\nAssets acquired As of\nNovember 30, 2019\nCash $ 546,411\nInventory (i) (i) 70,580\nProperty, plant and equipment (ii) (ii) 36,363\nAssets acquired excluding goodwill 653,354\nGoodwill (iii) (iii) 1,346,646\nTotal purchase price $ 2,000,000\n(i) Inventories acquired were sold on March 11, 2020\n(ii) Property, plant and equipment acquired includes computers, software and other office equipment.\n(iii) Goodwill is recorded when the cost of acquired businesses exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the period from November 30, 2019 through June 30, 2023 were as follows:\nSCHEDULE OF GOODWILL\nBalance as of November 30, 2019 $ 1,346,646\nAdditions and adjustments (1,346,646 )\nBalance as of June 30, 2023 $ -\nFor the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded an impairment of goodwill in the amount of $0 and $473,323, respectively. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 (second calendar quarter of 2021), the Company performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis on the TCBM Holdings, LLC acquisition and its $946,646 goodwill balance based on assessed potential indicators of impairment, including recent disruptions to the domestic CBD market resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the increasing uncertainty of near-term demand requirements, supply constraints and financing constraints. In the previous 2020 annual goodwill impairment evaluation, this reporting unit had a fair value of approximately 100% of the carrying value. The impairment assessment and valuation method require the Company to make estimates and assumptions regarding future operating results, cash flows, changes in working capital and capital expenditures, selling prices, profitability, and the cost of capital. As a result of the goodwill impairment evaluation, the Company determined that the fair value of the TCBM Holdings, LLC acquisition was below carrying value, including goodwill, by $473,323. This was primarily due to changes in the timing and amount of expected cash flows resulting from lower projected revenues, profitability and cash flows due to near-term reductions in the domestic CBD market. Consequently, during the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company recorded a $473,323 impairment charge for the partial impairment of the TCBM Holdings, LLC acquisition goodwill.\nGLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES, LTD\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nNOTE E - PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nSCHEDULE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nJune 30, 2023\nJune 30, 2022\nProperty and Equipment (i) $ 36,363 $ 36,363\nLess: accumulated depreciation (ii) (18,611 ) (13,419 )\nTotal $ 17,752 $ 22,944\n(i) Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated principally on methods and at rates designed to amortize their costs over their useful lives.\n(ii) Depreciation expense for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was $5,192 and $5,193, respectively.\nNOTE F - NOTE RECEIVABLE\nSCHEDULE OF NOTE RECEIVABLE\nJune 30, 2023 June 30, 2022\nNote receivable- Tersus Power, Inc. $ -\n$ 350,000\nTotal $ -\n$ 350,000\n(i) On December 14, 2021, the Company, was issued a Senior Secured Promissory Note (the Note) in the principal amount of $500,000 by Tersus Power, Inc.

Each Class B Share shall (subject to receipt of any and all necessary approvals) convert automatically into one fully paid and non-assessable Class A Share (i) upon its sale, gift, or other transfer to a party other than a Principal Stockholder (as defined below) or an Affiliate of a Principal Stockholder (as defined below), (ii) upon the death of the Class B Stockholder holding such Class B Share, unless the Class B Shares are transferred by operation of law to a Principal Stockholder or an Affiliate of a Principal Stockholder, or (iii) in the event of a sale, gift, or other transfer of a Class B Share to an Affiliate of a Principal Stockholder, upon the death of the transferor. Each of the foregoing automatic conversion events shall be referred to hereinafter as an Event of Automatic Conversion. For purposes of this ARTICLE FIVE, Principal Stockholder includes any of Donald H. Goldman, Steven M. Fieldman, Lance Fieldman, Yuri Itkis, Michall Itkis and Boris Itkis and an Affiliate of a Principal Stockholder is a person that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the person specified. For purposes of this definition, control, when used with respect to any specified person, means the power to direct or cause the direction of the management, and policies of such person, directly or indirectly, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. Without limitation, an Affiliate also includes the estate of such individual.\n(b) Voluntary Conversion. Each Class B Share shall be convertible at the option of the holder, for no additional consideration, into one fully paid and non-assessable Class A Share at any time.\n(c) Conversion Procedure. Promptly upon the occurrence of an Event of Automatic Conversion such that Class B shares are converted automatically into Class A Shares, or upon the voluntary conversion by the holder, the holder of such shares shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Class A Shares, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office (i) stating that the shares are being converted pursuant to an Event of Automatic Conversion into Class A Shares as provided in subparagraph 5.6(a) hereof or a voluntary conversion as provided in subparagraph 5.6(b) hereof, (ii) specifying the Event of Automatic Conversion (and, if the occurrence of such event is within the control of the transferor, stating the transferors intent to effect an Event of Automatic Conversion) or whether such conversion is voluntary, (iii) identifying the number of Class B Shares being converted, and (iv) setting out the name or names (with addresses) and denominations in which the certificate or certificates for Class A Shares shall be issued and including instructions for delivery thereof. Delivery of such notice together with the certificates representing the Class B Shares shall obligate the Corporation to issue such Class A Shares and the Corporation shall be justified in relying upon the information and the certification contained in such notice and shall not be liable for the result of any inaccuracy with respect thereto. Thereupon, the Corporation or its transfer agent shall promptly issue and deliver at such stated address to such holder or to the transferee of Class B Shares a certificate or certificates for the number of Class A Shares to which such holder or transferee is entitled, registered in the name of such holder, the designee of such holder or transferee, as specified in such notice. To the extent permitted by law, conversion pursuant to (i) an Event of Automatic Conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as of the date on which the Event of Automatic Conversion occurred or (ii) a voluntary conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as of the date the Corporation receives the written notice pursuant to this subparagraph (c) (each date being the Conversion Date). The person entitled to receive the Class A Shares issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such Class A Shares at and as of the Conversion Date, and the right of such person as the holder of Class B Shares shall cease and terminate at and as of the Conversion Date, in each case without regard to any failure by the holder to deliver the certificates or the notice by this subparagraph (c).\n(d) Unconverted Shares. In the event of the conversion of fewer than all of the Class B Shares evidenced by a certificate surrendered to the Corporation in accordance with the procedures of this Paragraph 5.6, the Corporation shall execute and deliver to or upon the written order of the holder of such certificate, without charge to such holder, a new certificate evidencing the number of Class B Shares not converted.\n(e) Reissue of Shares. Class B Shares that are converted into Class A Shares as provided herein shall be retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued.\n(f) Reservation. The Corporation hereby reserves and shall at all times reserve and keep available, out of its authorized and unissued Class A Shares, for the purpose of effecting conversions, such number of duly authorized Class A Shares as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Class B Shares. The Corporation covenants that all the Class A Shares so issuable shall, when so issued, be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and free from liens and charges with respect to the issue. The Corporation will take all such action as may be necessary to assure that all such Class A Shares may be so issued without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or any of the requirements of any national securities exchange upon which the Class A Shares may be listed. The Corporation will not take any action that results in any adjustment of the conversion ratio if the total number of Class A Shares issued and issuable after such action upon conversion of the Class B Shares would exceed the total number of Class A Shares then authorized by the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended.\nGLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES, LTD\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nNOTE J - CAPITAL STOCK (contd)\nOn June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company is authorized to issue 14,991,000,000 and 14,991,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, respectively.

As of June 30, 2023, the 300,000,000 shares of common stock had not been issued.\nMezzanine Equity\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company has common stock to be issued upon conversion of the Companys Series L Preferred Stock (Series L Preferred) in the amount of $2,899,448. As of June 30, 2023, the Series L Preferred can be converted at $0.0002 per share, into 14,497,440,097 shares of common stock. As of the balance sheet date and the date of this report, these shares have not been issued to the Purchaser. S99-3A(2) ASR 268 requires preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets to be classified outside of permanent equity if they are redeemable (1) at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date, (2) at the option of the holder, or (3) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer. Given that there is an unknown amount of preferred shares to be issued, cash has been repaid and the preferred shares are convertible at the option of the holder, the Company determined that mezzanine treatment appears appropriate. As such, the Company feels these securities should be classified as Mezzanine equity until they are fully issued.\nCommon Stock cancelled during the year ended June 30, 2022\nA total of 390,000,000 shares of common stock were returned to the Company by shareholders during the year ended June 30, 2022.\nOn October 18, 2021, a Default Final Judgment was entered in favor of the Company in the Complaint for Declaratory Judgment filed with the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida against Fortis Holdings, Ltd, Wayfarer Management, Ltd, Flash Funding, Inc. and OTC Capital Partners, LLC.

A valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In recognition of the uncertainty regarding the ultimate amount of income tax benefits to be derived, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance on June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities.\nSignificant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at an estimated effective tax rate of 21%. (35% for tax year 2017)\nThe provision for (benefit from) income taxes differ from the amount computed by applying the statutory United States federal income tax rate for the periods presented to income (loss) before income taxes. The income tax rate was 21% for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. The sources of the difference are as follows:\nSCHEDULE OF PROVISION (BENEFIT) FOR INCOME TAXES\nJune 30, 2023 June 30, 2022\nYear Ended\nJune 30, 2023 June 30, 2022\nExpected tax at 21% and 21%, respectively $ (217,148 ) $ (268,446 )\nNon-deductible stock-based compensation 15,750 -\nNon-deductible loss (non-taxable income) from derivative liability 14,238 10,768\nNon-deductible default principle - 4,700\nNon-deductible loss on issuance of convertible nots - 45,652\nNon-deductible amortization of debt discounts 10,471 89,276\nImpairment of goodwill - 99,398\nForgiveness of debt and accrued interest - (94,352 )\nIncrease (decrease) in Valuation allowance 176,689 113,004\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes $ - $ -\nAll tax years remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.\nSignificant components of the Companys deferred income tax are as follows:\nSCHEDULE OF COMPONENTS OF DEFERRED INCOME TAX\nJune 30, 2023 June 30, 2022\nUnpaid accrued officer and director compensation $ - $ -\nNet operating loss carry-forwards 841,378 451,785\nValuation allowance (841,378 ) (451,785 )\nNet non-current deferred tax asset $ - $ -\nBased on managements present assessment, the Company has not yet determined it to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset of $841,378 attributable to the net operating loss carry forward as of June 30, 2023 will be realized. Accordingly, the Company has provided a 100% allowance against the deferred tax asset in the financial statements at June 30, 2023. The Company will continue to review this valuation allowance and make adjustments as appropriate. $3,517,654 of the net operating loss can be carried forward indefinitely.\nCurrent tax laws limit the amount of loss available to be offset against future taxable income when a substantial change in ownership occurs. Therefore, the amount available to offset future taxable income may be limited to 80% of taxable income.\nGLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES, LTD\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nNOTE L - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nOccupancy\nOur principal executive office is located at 8 Campus Drive, Suite 105 Parsippany, New Jersey 07054 and our telephone number is (973) 233-5151.\nEmployment and Director Agreements\nOn May 17, 2023, the Company entered into an Employment Agreement (the Agreement) with Mr. Cutcher for his role as the Companys Chief Executive Officer. Under the terms of the Agreement, Mr. Cutcher is to receive a base salary of $100,000 and $100,000 in Restricted Stock Units that vest at the end of the initial term of the Agreement.

The compensation of $20,000 per quarter commenced with the third calendar quarter of 2021 (first fiscal quarter of 2022). On May 17, 2023, Mr. Anderson resigned in his role as an officer and director of the Company. Please see NOTE G - ACCRUED OFFICER AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION.\nNOTE M - GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY\nUnder ASC 205-40, we have the responsibility to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about our ability to meet our future financial obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. As required by this standard, our evaluation shall initially not take into consideration the potential mitigating effects of our plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements are issued.\nIn performing the first step of this assessment, we concluded that the following conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to meet our financial obligations as they become due. We have a history of net losses: As of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $167,478,377 and $166,444,337, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, we had cash used in operating activities of $392,437 and $484,410, respectively. We expect to continue to incur negative cash flows until such time as our operating segments generate sufficient cash inflows to finance our operations and debt service requirements.\nIn performing the second step of this assessment, we are required to evaluate whether our plans to mitigate the conditions above alleviate the substantial doubt about our ability to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Our future plans include securing additional funding sources that may include establishing corporate partnerships, establishing licensing revenue agreements, issuing additional convertible debentures and issuing public or private equity securities, including selling common stock through an at-the-market facility (ATM).\nThere is no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will be available through external sources. The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material effect on the business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms or they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Companys existing shareholders. We have therefore concluded there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from our failure to continue as a going concern.\nGLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES, LTD\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nNOTE N - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn November 17, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Agreement) with Jetco Holdings, LLC (the Purchaser).

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures.\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management conducted an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer and our principal financial and accounting officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, we concluded that because of the material weakness and significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2023 or 2022.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of our financial statements and related information. Management uses its best judgment to ensure that the financial statements present accurately, in material respects, our financial position and results of operations in fairness and conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in the Exchange Act. These internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the reported financial information is presented fairly, that disclosures are adequate, and that the assumptions and opinions in the preparation of financial statements are reasonable. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls, including the possibility of human error and overriding of controls. Consequently, an ineffective internal control system can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect to reporting financial information.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to maintaining records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with our managements and directors authorization; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nWe conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and published in 2013, and subsequent guidance prepared by COSO specifically for smaller public companies. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 for the reasons discussed below.\nA significant deficiency is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, that adversely affects the entitys ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the entitys financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected by the entitys internal control. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management identified the following material weakness and significant deficiencies in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022:\n\u25cf The Company did not maintain effective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting process because we lacked personnel with accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure that is commensurate with our financial reporting requirements.\n\u25cf Material Weakness - Inadequate segregation of duties.\nWe expect to be materially dependent on a third party that can provide us with accounting consulting services for the foreseeable future. Until such time as we have a chief financial officer with the requisite expertise in U.S. GAAP, there are no assurances that the material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will not result in errors in our financial statements, which could lead to a restatement of those financial statements. Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and maintained, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must account for resource constraints. In addition, the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, can and will be detected.\nChanges in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended June 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLoss Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company considers the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as its ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.\nAccounting for Acquisitions\nIn accordance with the guidance for business combinations, we determine whether a transaction or other event is a business combination, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business. Each business combination is then accounted for by applying the acquisition method. If the assets acquired are not a business, we account for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, we recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. In addition, for transactions that are business combinations, we evaluate the existence of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase. We capitalize acquisition-related costs and fees associated with asset acquisitions and immediately expense acquisition-related costs and fees associated with business combinations.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets (future tax benefits) and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the expected future tax return consequences of those differences, which are expected to be either deductible or taxable when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled.\nRecent Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13). Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) amends guideline on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, Topic 326 eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. For available-for-sale debt securities, credit losses should be measured in a manner similar to current GAAP, however Topic 326 will require that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. ASU 2016-13 affects entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. The amendments in this ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our financial statements.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-11. Among other things, ASU 2017-11 provides guidance that eliminates the requirement to consider down round features when determining whether certain financial instruments or embedded features are indexed to an entitys stock and need to be classified as liabilities. ASU 2017-11 provides for entities to recognize the effect of a down round feature only when it is triggered and then as a dividend and a reduction to income available to common stockholders in basic earnings per share. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018; early adoption is permitted. The Company has adopted ASU 2017-11. As a result, we have not recognized the fair value of the warrants containing down round features as liabilities.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). This ASU reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. As well as amend the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entitys own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. In addition, this ASU improves and amends the related EPS guidance. This standard is effective for us on May 1, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption is either a modified retrospective method or a fully retrospective method of transition. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on our financial statements.\nManagement has evaluated other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe that any of these pronouncements will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are not currently a party to, or otherwise involved with, any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nShare-based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (FASB ASC Topic 718), which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values.\nPART III Item 10. Directors and Executive Officers.\nDirectors and Executive Officers\nThe names and ages of our Directors and Executive Officers are set forth below. Our By-Laws provide for not less than one Director. All Directors are elected annually by the stockholders to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. The officers are elected by our Board.\nName Age Position and Term\nFredrick Cutcher President, Principal Financial Officer and Chairman of the Board (May 2023 to present)\nFredrick Cutcher President, Principal Financial Officer, Director and Chairman of the Board -\nFamily Relationships\nThere are no family relationships among the directors and executive officers.\nConflicts of Interest- General\nOur directors and officers are, or may become, in their individual capacities, officers, directors, controlling shareholder and/or partners of other entities engaged in a variety of businesses. Thus, there exist potential conflicts of interest including, among other things, time, efforts and corporation opportunity, involved in participation with such other business entities. While our sole officer and director of our business is engaged in business activities outside of our business, he devotes to our business such time as he believes to be necessary.\nConflicts of Interest- Corporate Opportunities\nPresently no requirement is contained in our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, or minutes which requires officers and directors of our business to disclose to us business opportunities which come to their attention. Our officers and directors do, however, have a fiduciary duty of loyalty to us to disclose to us any business opportunities which come to their attention, in their capacity as an officer and/or director or otherwise. Excluded from this duty would be opportunities which the person learns about through his involvement as an officer and director of another company. We have no intention of merging with or acquiring an affiliate, associate person or business opportunity from any affiliate or any client of any such person.\nCommittees to the Board of Directors\nIn the ordinary course of business, the board of directors maintains a compensation committee and an audit committee.\nThe primary function of the compensation committee is to review and make recommendations to the board of directors with respect to the compensation, including bonuses, of our officers and to administer the grants under our stock option plan.\nThe functions of the audit committee are to review the scope of the audit procedures employed by our independent auditors, to review with the independent auditors our accounting practices and policies and recommend to whom reports should be submitted, to review with the independent auditors their final audit reports, to review with our internal and independent auditors our overall accounting and financial controls, to be available to the independent auditors during the year for consultation, to approve the audit fee charged by the independent auditors, to report to the board of directors with respect to such matters and to recommend the selection of the independent auditors.\nIn the absence of a separate audit committee our board of directors functions as audit committee and performs some of the same functions of an audit committee, such as recommending a firm of independent certified public accountants to audit the annual financial statements; reviewing the independent auditors independence, the financial statements and their audit report; and reviewing managements administration of the system of internal accounting controls.\nInvolvement in Certain Legal Proceedings\nTo the best of our knowledge, none of our directors or executive officers has, during the past ten years:\n(1) had a petition under the Federal bankruptcy laws or any state insolvency law filed by or against, or a receiver, fiscal agent or similar officer was appointed by a court for the business or property of such person, or any partnership in which he was a general partner at or within two years before the time of such filing, or any corporation or business association of which he was an executive officer at or within two years before the time of such filing;\n(2) has been convicted in a criminal proceeding or is a named subject of a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses);\n(3) has been the subject of any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining him from, or otherwise limiting, the following activities:\n(i) Acting as a futures commission merchant, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, commodity pool operator, floor broker, leverage transaction merchant, any other person regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or an associated person of any of the foregoing, or as an investment adviser, underwriter, broker or dealer in securities, or as an affiliated person, director or employee of any investment company, bank, savings and loan association or insurance company, or engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with such activity;\n(ii) Engaging in any type of business practice;
