    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGENERAL\nUniFirst Corporation, a corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1950, together with its subsidiaries, hereunder referred to as we, our, the Company, or UniFirst, is one of the largest providers of workplace uniforms and protective work wear clothing in the United States. We design, manufacture, personalize, rent, clean, deliver, and sell a wide range of uniforms and protective clothing, including shirts, pants, jackets, coveralls, lab coats, smocks, aprons and specialized protective wear, such as flame resistant and high visibility garments. We also rent and sell industrial wiping products, floor mats, facility service products and other non-garment items, and provide restroom and cleaning supplies and first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies as well as certain safety training, to a variety of manufacturers, retailers and service companies. We serve businesses of all sizes in numerous industry categories. At certain specialized facilities, we also decontaminate and clean work clothes and other items that may have been exposed to radioactive materials and service special cleanroom protective wear and facilities.\nOur principal services include providing customers with uniforms and other non-garment items, picking up soiled uniforms or other items on a periodic basis (usually weekly), and delivering, at the same time, cleaned and processed items. We offer uniforms in a wide variety of styles, colors, sizes and fabrics and with personalized emblems selected by the customer. Our centralized services, specialized equipment and economies of scale generally allow us to be more cost effective in providing garment services than customers could be themselves, particularly those customers with high employee turnover rates. During the fiscal year ended August 27, 2022 (fiscal 2022), we manufactured approximately 61% of the garments we placed in service. These were primarily work pants and shirts manufactured at three of our plants located in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, one plant located in Managua, Nicaragua, as well as at subcontract manufacturers that we utilize to supplement our manufacturing capacity in periods of high demand. Because we design and manufacture a majority of our own uniforms and protective clothes, we can produce custom garment programs for our larger customers, offer a diverse range of such designs within our standard line of garments and better control the quality, price and speed at which we produce such garments.\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nWe provide our customers with personalized workplace uniforms and protective work clothing in a broad range of styles, colors, sizes and fabrics. Our uniform products include shirts, pants, jackets, coveralls, lab coats, smocks, aprons and specialized protective wear, such as flame resistant and high visibility garments. At certain specialized facilities, we also decontaminate and clean clothes and other items which may have been exposed to radioactive materials and service special cleanroom protective wear and facilities. We also offer non-garment items and services, such as industrial wiping products, floor mats, dry and wet mops, restroom and cleaning supplies and other textile products. We also sell first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies, provide certain safety training and maintain wholesale distribution and pill packaging operations.\nWe offer our customers a range of garment service options, including full-service rental programs in which garments are cleaned and serviced by us, lease programs in which garments are cleaned and maintained by individual employees and purchase programs to buy garments and related items directly. As part of our rental business, we pick up a customers soiled uniforms and/or other items on a periodic basis (usually weekly) and deliver back cleaned and processed replacement items. We believe our centralized services, specialized equipment and economies of scale generally allow us to be more cost effective in providing garment and related services than customers would be themselves, particularly those customers with high employee turnover rates. Our uniform program is intended not only to help our customers foster greater company identity, but to enhance their corporate image and improve employee safety, productivity and morale. We primarily serve our customers pursuant to written service contracts that range in duration from three to five years.\nHistorically, our revenues and operating results have varied from quarter to quarter and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations have been due to a number of factors, including: general economic conditions in our markets; the timing of acquisitions and of commencing start-up operations and related costs; our effectiveness in integrating acquired businesses and start-up operations; the timing of nuclear plant outages; capital expenditures; seasonal rental and purchasing patterns of our customers; and price changes in response to competitive factors. In addition, our operating results historically have been lower during the second and fourth fiscal quarters than during the other quarters of the fiscal year. The operating results for any historical quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for an entire fiscal year or any other interim periods.\nCUSTOMERS\nWe serve businesses of all sizes in most industry categories. During each of the past three years, no single customer in our Core Laundry Operations segment accounted for more than 10% of our revenues. Our typical customers include automobile service centers and dealers, delivery services, food and general merchandise retailers, manufacturers, maintenance facilities, restaurants and food-related businesses, healthcare providers including vaccine manufacturers, business service providers, soft and durable goods wholesalers, transportation and warehousing companies, energy production and transmission operations, and many others who require employee clothing on the job for image, identification, protection and/or utility purposes. Among our largest customers of our conventional uniform rental business are divisions, units, regional operations or franchised agencies of major, nationally recognized organizations. With respect to our Specialty Garments segment, typical customers include government agencies, research and development laboratories, high technology companies, cleanroom operators, and utilities operating nuclear reactors. We currently service over 300,000 customer locations in the United States, Canada and Europe from 260 customer service, distribution and manufacturing facilities.\nMARKETING, SALES, AND CUSTOMER SERVICE\nWe market our products and services to a diverse customer base and to prospects that range across virtually all industry segments. Marketing contact is made through print advertising, direct mail, publicity, trade shows, catalogs, telemarketing, multiple web sites and direct field sales representation. We have built and maintain an extensive, proprietary database of prescreened and qualified business prospects that have been sourced from our various promotional initiatives, including mailers, web site contacts, advertising responses, sales calls and lists purchased from third-party providers. These prospect records serve as a primary targeting resource for our professional sales organization and are constantly updated, expanded and maintained by an in-house team of specialist database qualifiers and managers. To aid in the effective marketing of products and services, we supply sales representatives with an extensive selection of sales aids, brochures, presentation materials and vertical market communications tools. We also provide representatives with detailed on-line profiles of high opportunity markets to educate them to the typical issues, needs and concerns of those markets. This helps establish credibility and aids their ability to deliver value-based solutions.\nWe employ a large team of trained professional sales representatives whose sole function is to market our services to potential customers and develop new accounts. While most of our sales representatives are capable of presenting a full range of service solutions, some are dedicated to developing business for a limited range of products and services or have a specific market focus.\nFor example, in select geographic markets we employ teams of dedicated facility services sales representatives who focus exclusively on developing business for our floor care, restroom and related service programs. We employ specialist executive-level salespeople in our National Account Organization-some who specialize in rental programs and some who specialize in direct sale programs-to target the very largest national companies with known uniform and/or facility services program needs. We believe that effective customer service is the most important element in developing and maintaining our market position. Our commitment to service excellence is reflected throughout our organization. Our route sales representatives are the first line of continuing customer contact, who are supported by local customer service representatives, local service management staff and local operations management leaders, all of whom are focused on addressing the ongoing needs of customers, constantly delivering high-value service and pursuing total customer satisfaction. Our proprietary information systems and our support service center enable us to respond to customer inquiries or issues within 24 hours, and our service personnel are specially trained to handle the daily contact work necessary to effectively manage customer relations.\nWe measure the speed and accuracy of our customer service efforts on a weekly basis and, through our Customers for Life program, we continuously survey, record and report satisfaction levels as a means of evaluating current performance and highlighting areas for improvement.\nCOMPETITION\nThe uniform rental and sales industry is highly competitive. The principal methods of competition in the industry are the quality of products, the quality of service and price. Our principal competitors include Cintas Corporation, Alsco and Aramarks uniform services business. The remainder of the market is divided among several hundred smaller businesses, mostly serving a single or a limited number of geographic service areas. In addition to our traditional rental competitors, we may increasingly compete in the future with businesses that focus on selling uniforms and other related items.\nMANUFACTURING AND SOURCING\nWe manufactured approximately 61% of all garments we placed in service during fiscal 2022. These garments were primarily work pants and shirts manufactured at three of our plants located in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, one plant located in Managua, Nicaragua, as well as at subcontracted manufacturers that we utilize to supplement our manufacturing capacity in periods of high demand. The balance of the garments used in our programs are purchased from a variety of industry suppliers. While we currently acquire the raw materials with which we produce our garments from a limited number of suppliers, we believe that such materials are generally readily available from other sources. To date, we have experienced limited difficulty in obtaining any of our raw materials or supplies although at certain times, we have sourced raw materials or supplies from alternative sources or experienced costs increases for such raw materials and supplies. Currently, we also manufacture approximately 98% of the mats we place in service at our plant in Cave City, Arkansas.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nAs of August 27, 2022, we employed approximately 14,000 persons, and less than 1% of our United States employees are represented by a union pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.\nOur success depends on our employee team partners. As a result, we strive to recruit, develop and retain talented team partners. We provide training to our team partners along with opportunities to advance. For example, our leadership development program provides leadership education, operational knowledge and hands-on business experience within the industrial laundry and facilities services industry and is designed to develop our future managers.\nWe also seek to promote a family culture and a culture of diversity and inclusion. We believe that promoting diversity and inclusion in our workforce is critical to our success and to the service of our customers.\nIn addition, we focus on the safety and well-being of our team partners. We provide safety training and personal protective equipment, which has been particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also provide our team partners with competitive healthcare, wellness and other benefits.\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nOur executive officers are as follows:\nNAME\nAGE\nPOSITION\nSteven S.

In particular, industrial laundries currently use and must dispose of detergent waste water and other residues, and, in the past, used perchloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents. We are attentive to the environmental concerns surrounding the disposal of these materials and have, through the years taken measures to avoid their improper disposal. We have settled, or contributed to the settlement of, past actions or claims brought against us relating to the disposal of hazardous materials at several sites and there can be no assurance that we will not have to expend material amounts to remediate the consequences of any such disposal in the future. Further, under environmental laws, an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on, or in, or emanating from such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee knew of, or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. There can be no assurance that acquired or leased locations have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon us under such laws or expose us to third-party actions such as tort suits. We continue to address environmental conditions under terms of consent orders negotiated with the applicable environmental authorities or otherwise with respect to certain sites. We routinely review and evaluate sites that may require remediation and monitoring and determine our estimated costs based on various estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of our accruals with respect to environmental liabilities and additional discussion regarding environmental matters, refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer also to the risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding environmental matters.\nOur nuclear garment decontamination facilities in the United States are licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or in certain cases, by the applicable state agency, and are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities. We also have nuclear garment decontamination facilities in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. These facilities are licensed and regulated by the respective countrys applicable federal agency. In the past, scrutiny and regulation of nuclear facilities and related services have resulted in the suspension of operations at certain nuclear facilities served by us or disruptions in our ability to service such facilities. There can be no assurance that such scrutiny and regulation will not lead to the shut-down of such facilities or otherwise cause material disruptions in our garment decontamination business.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nWe make available free of charge our Proxy Statement, Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, including exhibits and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).

Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which they are made.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS\nWe face intense competition within our industry, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe uniform rental and sales industry is highly competitive. The principal methods of competition in the industry are quality of products, quality of service and price. Our leading competitors include Cintas Corporation, Alsco and Aramark. The remainder of the market, however, is divided among more than 600 smaller businesses, many of which serve one or a limited number of markets or geographic service areas. In addition to our traditional rental competitors, we may increasingly compete in the future with businesses that focus on selling uniforms and other related items, including single-use disposable garments for use in the nuclear industry. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We also compete with industry competitors for acquisitions, which has the effect of increasing the price for acquisitions and reducing the number of acquisition candidates available to us. If we pay higher prices for businesses we acquire, our returns on investment and profitability may be reduced.\nAdverse economic and business conditions or geopolitical events, including public health events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may affect our business and our customer base and have a material adverse impact on our sales and operating results.\nWe supply uniform services to many industries that have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to adverse economic and business conditions resulting in shifting employment levels, workforce reductions, changes in worker productivity, uncertainty regarding the impacts of rehiring and shifts to offshore manufacturing. In addition, geopolitical conflicts, calamities or other events, including public health events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may disrupt domestic and global business and financial markets and conditions.\nIn recent months, we have observed increased economic uncertainty in the United States and abroad, including the potential for an economic recession. Impacts of such general economic weakness include, without limitation: falling overall demand for goods and services; reduced credit availability; reduced liquidity; volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets; bankruptcies and rising interest rates.\nAdverse economic conditions have included or resulted, and could continue to include or result, in a significant increase in inflation, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, including our operating margins. Any conditions or events that adversely affect our current customers or sales prospects may cause such customers or prospects to restrict expenditures, reduce workforces or even to cease to conduct their businesses. Any of these circumstances would have the effect of reducing the number of employees utilizing our uniform services, which could have a material adverse impact on our sales and results of operations.\nOur failure to implement successfully our acquisition strategy and to grow our business could adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues and could negatively impact our profitability.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to continue to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities. However, as discussed above, we compete with others within our industry for suitable acquisition candidates. This competition may increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of acquisition candidates available to us. As a result, our ability to acquire businesses in the future, and to acquire such businesses on favorable terms, may be limited. Even if we are able to acquire businesses on favorable terms, managing growth through acquisition is a difficult process that includes integration and training of personnel, combining plant and operating procedures and additional matters related to the integration of acquired businesses within our existing organization. Unanticipated issues related to integration may result in additional expense or in disruption to our operations, either of which could negatively impact our ability to achieve anticipated benefits. While we believe we will be able to fully integrate acquired businesses, we can give no assurance that we will be successful in this regard.\nGrowth of our business will likely require us to increase our work force, the scope of our operating and financial systems and the geographic area of our operations. We believe this growth will increase our operating complexity and the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel. Managing and sustaining our growth and expansion may require substantial enhancements to our operational and financial systems and controls, as well as additional administrative, operational and financial resources. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our expanding operations successfully, that any acquired business will perform as we expect, or that we will be able to maintain or accelerate our growth, and any failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn order to finance such acquisitions, we may need to obtain additional funds either through public or private financings, including bank and other secured and unsecured borrowings and the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that such financings would be available to us on reasonable terms or that any future issuances of securities in connection with acquisitions will not be dilutive to our shareholders.\nIf we are unable to preserve positive labor relationships or become the target of corporate labor unionization campaigns, the resulting labor unrest could disrupt our business by impairing our ability to produce and deliver our products.\nAs of August 27, 2022, we employ approximately 14,000 persons and less than 1% of our United States employees are represented by a union pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. Competitors within our industry have been the target of corporate unionization campaigns by multiple labor unions. While our management believes that our employee relations are good, we cannot assure you that we will not become the target of campaigns similar to those faced by our competitors. The potential for unionization could increase if the United States Congress passes federal card check legislation in the future. If we do encounter pressure from any labor unions in connection with our acquisitions of other businesses, any resulting labor unrest could disrupt our business by impairing our ability to produce and deliver our products. In addition, significant union representation would require us to negotiate wages, salaries, benefits and other terms with many of our employees collectively and could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our labor costs or otherwise restricting our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations.\nWe may incur unexpected cost increases due to rising healthcare costs, the Affordable Care Act and other labor costs.\nIn general, the cost of healthcare that we provide to our employees has grown over the last few years at a rate in excess of our revenue growth and, as a result, has negatively impacted our operating results. Moreover, it is generally expected that healthcare costs in the United States will increase over the coming years. In addition, we may incur significant healthcare costs if a significant number of our employees experience injury or illness, including in connection with public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of these factors, and depending on the effect of any modifications we have made and may make in the future to our employee healthcare plans and enrollment levels in those plans, including as a result of the Affordable Care Act or any future legislation or regulation affecting the healthcare industry, we expect that our future operating results will continue to be further adversely impacted by increasing healthcare costs.\nFederal, state and municipal governments are mandating increases to minimum wage and other employee benefits. In addition, we face wage pressure as the result of a low unemployment environment and increased competition in hiring. We have raised, and expect to continue to raise, our wage rates and benefits to reflect these changes, which has the effect of increasing our labor costs, which in turn adversely affects our results of operation and financial condition. Our failure to comply with these regulatory requirements would expose us to applicable penalties and increase the likelihood that we would be subject to unionization campaigns. Further mandates would require additional increases to our labor costs and adversely affect our operating margins.\nOur failure to retain our current customers, renew our existing customer contracts and enter into customer contracts with new customers could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain our current customers, renew our existing customer contracts and obtain new customers. Our ability to do so generally depends on a variety of factors, including the quality, price and responsiveness of our services, as well as our ability to market these services effectively and to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. In addition, renewal rates and our ability to obtain new customers are generally adversely affected by difficult economic and business conditions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new customers, renew existing customer contracts at the same or higher rates or that our current customers will not turn to competitors, cease operations or terminate contracts with us. Our failure to renew a significant number of our existing contracts would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and failure to obtain new customers could have an adverse effect on our growth and results of operations.\nIncreases in fuel and energy costs could materially adversely affect our operating costs.\nThe price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries, regional production patterns, limits on refining capacities, natural disasters, environmental concerns, including the impact of legislative and regulatory efforts to limit GHG emissions, and public health emergencies, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our operating margins have been, and may continue to be, adversely\nimpacted by the recent surge in energy prices. A continuing surge in fuel and energy costs or any further increases in fuel and energy costs could materially adversely affect our operating costs.\nAs a result of our significant presence in energy producing regions, a prolonged drop in energy prices could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe have a substantial number of plants and conduct a significant portion of our business in energy producing regions in the U.S. and Canada. In general, we are relatively more dependent on business in these regions than are many of our competitors. If a dramatic decrease in oil prices were to occur, it could impact our customers in the oil industry and cause those customers to curtail their level of operations, which could have a corresponding effect on our customers in businesses which service or supply the oil industry as well as our customers in unrelated businesses. As a result, our organic growth in periods following a dramatic decrease in oil prices could be negatively impacted by elevated headcount reductions in our wearer base as well as increased lost accounts. At times, volatility in energy prices has had and may in the future have a significant impact on wearer levels at existing customers in our North American energy-dependent markets.\nFluctuations in the nuclear portion of our Specialty Garments segment, including the loss of key customers or a significant reduction in our business derived from key customers, could disproportionately impact our revenue and net income and create volatility in the price of our Common Stock.\nOur nuclear decontamination business is affected by shut-downs, outages and clean-ups of the nuclear facilities we service. We are not able to control or predict with certainty when such shut-downs, outages and clean-ups will occur. In addition, our nuclear decontamination business tends to generate more revenue in the first and third fiscal quarters, which is when nuclear power plants typically schedule their plant outages and refuelings and thereby increase nuclear garment utilization. Moreover, a significant percentage of this segments revenues are generated from a limited number of nuclear power plant operator customers. This concentration subjects this business to significant risks and may result in greater volatility in this segments results of operations. Fluctuations in our nuclear decontamination business, including the loss of key customers of our Specialty Garments business, or a significant reduction in our business derived from such key customers, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nContinued high inflation rates, or further increases in inflation rates, could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and operating margins. In addition, if our costs increase and we are not able to pass along these price increases to our customers, our results of operations would be adversely affected, and the adverse impact may be material.\nInflation rates, particularly in the United States, have increased recently to historic levels and have had an adverse impact on our operating margins. Continued high inflation or increases in inflation may result in decreased demand for our products and services, increased operating costs, including our labor costs, reduced liquidity, and limitations on our ability to access credit or otherwise raise debt and equity capital. In addition, the United States Federal Reserve has raised, and may again raise, interest rates in response to concerns about inflation. Increases in interest rates, especially if coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets, may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks, which may result in economic recession. In an inflationary environment, we may be unable to raise the prices of our products and services at or above the rate at which our costs increase, which may reduce our operating margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We also may experience lower than expected sales and potential adverse impacts on our competitive position if there is a decrease in customer spending or a negative reaction to our pricing. A reduction in our revenue would be detrimental to our profitability and financial condition and could also have an adverse impact on our future growth.\nOur international business results are influenced by currency fluctuations and other risks that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA portion of our sales is derived from international markets. Revenue denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar represented approximately 7.9%, 8.4% and 6.9% of total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2022, the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021 (fiscal 2021) and the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020 (fiscal 2020), respectively. The operating results of our international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars and such results are affected by movements in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The strength of the U.S. dollar has generally increased recently as compared to other currencies, which has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our operating results as reported in U.S. dollars. In addition, a weaker Canadian dollar increases the costs to our Canadian operations of merchandise and other operational inputs that are sourced from outside Canada, which has the effect of reducing the operating margins of our Canadian business if we are unable to recover these additional costs through price adjustments with our Canadian customers. Our international operations\nare also subject to other risks, including the requirement to comply with changing and conflicting national and local regulatory requirements; potential difficulties in staffing and labor disputes; managing and obtaining support and distribution for local operations; credit risk or financial condition of local customers; potential imposition of restrictions on investments; potentially adverse tax consequences, including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries; foreign exchange controls; and local political and social conditions. In addition, U.S. and foreign trade policies and tariffs and other impositions on imported goods may have a negative impact on our business. There can be no assurance that the foregoing factors will not have an adverse effect on our international operations or on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nWe own and operate manufacturing facilities in Mexico. Violence, crime and instability in Mexico has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our operations, including the hijacking of our trucks and the implementation of security measures to protect our employees. We are not insured against such criminal attacks and there can be no assurance that losses that could result from an attack on our trucks or our personnel would not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Operations in developing nations present several additional risks, including greater fluctuation in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, economic and governmental instability, civil disturbances, volatility in gross domestic production, Foreign Corrupt Practice Act compliance issues and nationalization and expropriation of private assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to properly and efficiently design, construct, implement and operate a new customer relationship management (CRM) computer system or an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system could materially disrupt our operations, adversely impact the servicing of our customers and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we initiated a multiyear CRM project to further develop, implement and deploy a third-party application we licensed. Our previous CRM systems project, which we terminated in 2018, did not result in the successful implementation of a CRM system.\nWe began deployment of our new CRM project during the third quarter of fiscal 2021, and the deployment is ongoing. This new system is intended to improve functionality, capability and information flow as well as increase automation in servicing our customers. In addition, we are working on a corporate-wide ERP system with a strong focus on supply chain and procurement automation and technology. The failure to properly, efficiently and economically complete, implement and operate such systems on a timely basis or at all could materially disrupt our operations, adversely impact the servicing of our customers and have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nIf our information technology systems suffer interruptions or failures, including as a result of cyber-attacks, our business operations could be disrupted or other material adverse impacts on our business could result.\nOur information technology systems serve an important role in the efficient operation of our business. The failure of these information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, our information technology systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, ransomware, computer viruses or cyber-based attacks. Further, state-sponsored cyber-attacks could expand as part of the hostilities in Ukraine, which could adversely affect our or our suppliers ability to maintain and enhance key cyber security and data protection measures. While we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events, if such events were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis, we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations and service our customers, and we may be required to make a significant investment to fix or replace our information technology systems, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, if customer, employee or our proprietary information is compromised by a security breach or cyber-attack or other event, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, including as a result of remedial actions that we may be required to take, potential liabilities and penalties, loss of business and reputational damage. Our failure to properly respond to any such event could also result in exposure to liability. We are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the United States and internationally designed to protect the information of clients, customers, employees, and other third parties that we collect and maintain. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number. If we fail to comply with such laws or regulations, we may be subject to litigation, monetary damages, enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe also rely on systems and applications provided by third-party vendors for certain information technology services. If these third-party vendors, or our suppliers or other vendors, experience service interruptions, security breaches, cyber-attacks,\ncomputer viruses, ransomware or other similar events, customer, employee or other proprietary information could be compromised and it could as a result or otherwise, have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur business may be subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations.\nHistorically, our revenues and operating results have varied from quarter to quarter and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. In addition, our operating results historically have been seasonally lower during the second and fourth fiscal quarters than during the other quarters of the fiscal year. We incur various costs in integrating or establishing newly acquired businesses or start-up operations, and the profitability of a new location is generally expected to be lower in the initial period of its operation than in subsequent periods. Start-up operations in particular lack the support of an existing customer base and require a significantly longer period to develop sales opportunities and meet targeted operating results.\nThese factors, among others, may cause our results of operations in some future quarters to be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nLoss of our key management or other personnel and our inability to hire qualified personnel could adversely impact our business.\nOur success is largely dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, and certain other key personnel. If, for any reason, one or more senior executives or key personnel were not to remain active in our Company, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Our future success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees. There is competition in the market for the services of such qualified personnel and hourly workers. In addition, we face wage pressure as the result of a low unemployment environment and increased competition in hiring. We have raised, and expect to continue to raise, our wage rates and benefits to reflect these changes, which has the effect of increasing our labor costs, which in turn adversely affects our results of operation and financial condition. Our failure to attract and retain such personnel or workers could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe depend on third parties to supply us with raw materials and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate raw materials in a timely manner.\nWe manufactured approximately 61% of all garments we placed in service during fiscal 2022. These were primarily work pants and shirts manufactured at three of our plants located in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, one plant located in Managua, Nicaragua, as well as at subcontracted manufacturers that we utilize to supplement our manufacturing capacity in periods of high demand. The balance of the garments used in our programs are purchased from a variety of industry suppliers. While we currently acquire the raw materials with which we produce our garments from a limited number of suppliers, we believe that such materials are generally readily available from other sources. To date, we have experienced no significant difficulty in obtaining any of our raw materials or supplies, although at certain times, we have sourced raw materials or supplies from alternative sources or experienced costs increases for such raw materials and supplies. However, if we were to experience difficulty obtaining any of our raw materials from such suppliers and were unable to obtain new materials or supplies from other industry suppliers, or if the cost of obtaining such materials or supplies were to increase, including in any case as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Russias invasion of Ukraine or other supply chain disruptions, it could adversely affect our results of operations.\nUnexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nUnexpected events, including, without limitation, fires at facilities, natural disasters as a result of climate change or otherwise, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and tornados, public health emergencies, war or terrorist activities, unplanned utility outages, pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, supply disruptions, failure of equipment or information systems, temporary or long-term disruption of our computer systems, or changes in laws and/or regulations impacting our business, could adversely affect our operating results. These events could result in disruption of customer service, physical damage to one or more key operating facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems. In addition, the destruction or temporary loss of our distribution facility in Owensboro, Kentucky or our manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Nicaragua would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting material adverse economic conditions had in the past a significant adverse impact on our business and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has, at times, resulted in material adverse economic conditions that have impacted, and may again impact, our business and the businesses of our suppliers and customers. For example, at times during the COVID-19 pandemic our revenues have been significantly adversely impacted as a result of many customers closing their business operations or operating at limited capacities. In addition, at times during the pandemic, we have experienced supply chain disruptions with respect to certain products, including hand sanitizer and masks. Although there continues to be supply chain disruption that is impacting our operating results, these adverse impacts and disruptions have declined since the height of the pandemic.\nAny future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations and the business and operations of our customers and suppliers remain uncertain. New variants of the virus could emerge, the virus may continue to spread and there could be future impositions of related public health measures and travel, health-related, business and other restrictions. Such conditions and any related material adverse economic conditions could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The COVID-19 pandemic has also, at times, resulted in severe disruption and volatility in the financial markets, and the market price of our Common Stock on the NYSE has, at times, declined dramatically. The price of our Common Stock on the NYSE may experience volatility and declines should future outbreaks and continued spread of the virus occur.\nWe are controlled by our principal shareholders, and our other shareholders may be unable to affect the outcome of shareholder voting.\nAs of October 21, 2022, to the Companys knowledge, the members of the Croatti family and other family members owned, directly or indirectly, in the aggregate approximately 3,590,295 shares of our Class B Common Stock, which represents approximately 19.2% of the aggregate number of outstanding shares of our Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, but approximately 70.4% of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. To the Companys knowledge, the members of the Croatti family and other family members owned, directly or indirectly, a number of shares of Common Stock. As a result, the members of the Croatti family, acting with other family members, could effectively control most matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of a majority of the directors. While historically the members of the Croatti family have individually voted their respective shares of Class B Common Stock in the same manner, there is no contractual understanding requiring this and there is no assurance that the family members will continue to individually vote their shares of Class B Common Stock in the same manner. This voting control by the members of the Croatti family, together with certain provisions of our by-laws and articles of organization, could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company that would otherwise be beneficial to our public shareholders.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to our revenue and accounts receivable process, caused principally by ineffective information technology general controls. If not remediated appropriately and timely, such material weakness could adversely impact our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, result in loss of investor confidence and have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nInternal control related to the operation of technology systems are critical to maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting for our revenue and accounts receivable process. This material weakness primarily related to ineffective information technology general controls (ITGCs) in the area of user access over the CRM system that we are in the process of deploying. As a result, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of August 27, 2022. This issue was attributable to numerous role security defects that we experienced in the application and uncertainty that additional role security defects would not arise. Our business process controls within the revenue and accounts receivable process, both automated and manual, that are dependent on the completeness and accuracy of the information derived from the affected IT system were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. Although we are working on remedial measures, there can be no assurance that such remedial measures will be successful and that we will be able to remediate the material weakness prior to the end of fiscal 2023. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness appropriately and timely, or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nOur business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting, including as a result of the material weakness identified by management and discussed above.\nThe design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, including new and revised financial and information technology-related controls that we have been designing, implementing and operating in connection with the deployment of our new CRM system, may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, including the material weakness identified by management and discussed above and any additional material weakness which may occur in the future, could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nThe expenses we incur to comply with environmental regulations, including costs associated with potential environmental remediation, may prove to be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe, like our competitors, are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and other substances. In particular, industrial laundries currently use and must dispose of detergent waste water and other residues, and, in the past, used perchloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents. We are attentive to the environmental concerns surrounding the disposal of these materials and have, through the years, taken measures to avoid their improper disposal. Over the years, we have settled, or contributed to the settlement of, past actions or claims brought against us relating to the disposal of hazardous materials at several sites and there can be no assurance that we will not have to expend material amounts to remediate the consequences of any such disposal in the future. Further, under environmental laws, an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on, or in, or emanating from such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. There can be no assurance that acquired or leased locations have been operated in\ncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon us under such laws or expose us to third-party actions such as tort suits.\nWe continue to address environmental conditions under terms of consent orders negotiated with the applicable environmental authorities or otherwise with respect to sites located in or related to certain sites.\nWe have accrued certain costs related to certain sites, including but not limited to, sites in Woburn and Somerville, Massachusetts, as it has been determined that the costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We, together with multiple other companies, are party to a consent decree related to our property and parcels of land (the Central Area) at a site in Woburn, Massachusetts. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) has provided us and other signatories to the consent decree with comments on the design and implementation of groundwater and soil remedies at the Woburn site and investigation of environmental conditions in the Central Area. The consent decree does not address any remediation work that may be required in the Central Area. We, and other signatories, have implemented and proposed to do additional work at the Woburn site but many of the EPAs comments remain to be resolved. We have accrued costs to perform certain work responsive to the EPAs comments. Additionally, we have implemented mitigation measures and continue to monitor environmental conditions at a site in Somerville, Massachusetts. We have agreed to undertake additional actions responsive to a notice of audit findings from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection concerning a regulatory submittal that we made in 2009 for a portion of the site. We have received demands from the local transit authority for reimbursement of certain costs associated with its construction of a new municipal transit station in the area of the Somerville site. This station is part of an ongoing extension of the transit system. We have reserved for costs in connection with this matter; however, in light of the uncertainties associated with this matter, these costs and the related reserve may change.\nOn a quarterly basis, we assess each of our environmental sites to determine whether the costs of investigation and remediation of environmental conditions are probable and can be reasonably estimated as well as the adequacy of our accruals with respect to such costs. There can be no assurance that our accruals with respect to our environmental sites will be sufficient or that the costs of remediation and investigation will not substantially exceed our accruals as new facts, circumstances or estimates arise.\nOur nuclear garment decontamination facilities are licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or in certain cases, by the applicable state agency, and are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities. We also have nuclear garment decontamination facilities in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. These facilities are licensed and regulated by the respective countrys applicable federal agency. In the past, scrutiny and regulation of nuclear facilities and related services have resulted in the suspension of operations at certain nuclear facilities served by us or disruptions in our ability to service such facilities. There can be no assurance that such scrutiny and regulation will not lead to the shut-down of such facilities or otherwise cause material disruptions in our garment decontamination business.\nIn addition, our nuclear garment decontamination operations are subject to asset retirement obligations related to the decommissioning of our nuclear laundry facilities. We recognize as a liability the present value of the estimated future costs to decommission these facilities. The estimated liability is based on historical experience in decommissioning nuclear laundry facilities, estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, external vendor estimates as to the cost to decommission these assets in the future, and federal and state regulatory requirements. No assurances can be given that these accruals will be sufficient or that the costs of such decommissioning will not substantially exceed such accruals, as our facts, circumstances or estimates change, including changes in the Companys estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, estimated dates of decommissioning, changes in decommissioning costs, changes in federal or state regulatory guidance on the decommissioning of such facilities, or other changes in estimates.\nIn addition to contingencies and claims relating to environmental compliance matters, we may from time to time be subject to legal or regulatory proceedings and claims related to our business operations which may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition to contingencies and claims relating to environmental compliance matters, we are subject from time to time to legal or regulatory proceedings, including, without limitation, with respect to tax matters, and to claims and disputes arising from the conduct of our business operations, including personal injury claims, customer contract matters and employment claims such as claims alleging violations of, and damages under, the Fair Labor Standards Act (the FLSA). Refer to Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion, including regarding a tax assessment matter in Mexico and claims relating to the FLSA. Certain of the claims to which we are subject are typically not covered by our available insurance. In addition, claims occasionally result in significant investigation and\nlitigation expenses and, if successful, may result in material losses to us. Certain claims may also result in significant adverse publicity against us. As a consequence, successful claims against us not covered by our available insurance coverage, or the impact of adverse publicity against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nFailure to comply with state, federal and other rules and regulations to which we are subject may result in penalties or costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is subject to various state, federal, international and other rules and regulations, including employment laws and regulations such as the FLSA, minimum wage requirements, overtime requirements, working condition requirements, citizenship requirements, healthcare insurance mandates, data protection requirements, import and export requirements and restrictions and other laws, rules and regulations, including those of the SEC and NYSE and those relating to accounting. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with the laws and regulations to which we are subject. Any appreciable increase in the statutory minimum wage rate, income or overtime pay, costs of complying with healthcare insurance mandates, changes in the requirements under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, changes in environmental compliance requirements, or changes to immigration laws and citizenship requirements would likely result in an increase in our labor costs and/or contribute to a shortage of available labor and such cost increase or labor shortage, or the penalties for failing to comply with such statutory minimums or regulations, could have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity and results of operations. The impact of any new laws, rules and regulations, or changes to laws, rules and regulations, cannot be predicted and could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs. Any failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations could result in substantial fines or penalties by government authorities, payment of damages to private litigants or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations, which could adversely affect our ability to service customers and our results of operations.\nChanges in or new interpretations of the governmental regulatory framework may affect our contract terms and may reduce our sales or profits.\nA portion of our total consolidated revenues is derived from business with U.S. federal, state and local governments and agencies. Changes or new interpretations in, or changes in the enforcement of, the statutory or regulatory framework applicable to services provided under governmental contracts or bidding procedures could result in fewer new contracts or contract renewals, modifications to the methods we apply to price government contracts or in contract terms of shorter duration than we have historically experienced, any of which could result in lower sales or profits than we have historically achieved, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nAdverse global financial and economic conditions may result in impairment of our goodwill and intangibles.\nOur market capitalization, from time to time, has experienced volatility due in part to turbulent economic conditions and disruption in the global equity and credit markets. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), we may be required to record an impairment charge if changes in circumstances or events indicate that the carrying values of our goodwill and intangible assets exceed their fair value and are not recoverable. Any significant and other-than-temporary decrease in our market capitalization could be an indicator, when considered together with other factors, that the carrying values of our goodwill and intangible assets exceed their fair value, which may result in our recording an impairment charge. We are unable to predict economic trends, but we continue to monitor the impact of changes in economic and financial conditions on our operations and on the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets. Should the value\nof our acquired goodwill or one or more of our acquired intangibles become impaired, our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected.\nThe price of our Common Stock may be highly volatile, which could result in significant price declines.\nThe price of our Common Stock may experience significant volatility. Such volatility may be caused by fluctuations in our operating results, changes in earnings estimated by investment analysts, the number of shares of our Common Stock traded each day, the degree of success we achieve in implementing our business and growth strategies, changes in business or regulatory conditions affecting us, our customers or our competitors and other factors, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the NYSE historically has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to, or disproportionate to, the operating performance of its listed companies. These fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nIf we are unable to accurately predict our future tax liabilities or become subject to increased levels of taxation or our tax contingencies are unfavorably resolved, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe rules dealing with U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. taxation are regularly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the U.S. Treasury Department and other taxing authorities. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect us or holders of our Common Stock. Any such tax laws, regulations, interpretations, or rulings could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. These changes could subject us to additional income taxes and non-income taxes (such as payroll, sales, use, import, value-added, digital tax, net worth, property, and goods and services taxes), which in turn could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. Additionally, new, changed, modified, or newly interpreted or applied tax laws could increase our customers and our compliance costs, operating and other costs, as well as the costs of our products. In recent years, many such changes have been made, and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. As we expand the scale of our business activities, any changes in the U.S. and non-U.S. taxation of such activities may increase our effective tax rate and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are also subject to tax audits in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business, including, but not limited to, various states, as well as Canada and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Quebec and New Brunswick, and Mexico. These audits can be complicated and can require several years to resolve. The final resolution of any such tax audit could result in an increase in our income tax and other tax liabilities. Although we believe that our current tax provisions are reasonable and appropriate, there can be no assurance that these items will be settled for the amounts accrued, that additional tax exposures will not be identified in the future or that additional tax reserves will not be necessary for any such exposures. Any increase in the amount of taxes we owe, including any fines or penalties, as a result of challenges to our tax filing positions could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Refer to Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion, including regarding a tax assessment matter in Mexico. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nAs of August 27, 2022, we owned or leased approximately 260 facilities containing an aggregate of approximately 7.9 million square feet located in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Nicaragua. We owned 136 of these facilities, containing approximately 6.1 million square feet. These facilities include our 325,000 square foot Owensboro, Kentucky distribution center and almost all of our industrial laundry processing plants. We believe our industrial laundry facilities are among the most modern in the industry.\nWe own substantially all of the machinery and equipment used in our operations. We believe that our facilities and our production, cleaning and decontamination equipment have been well maintained and are adequate for our present needs. We also own a fleet of approximately 4,300 delivery vans, trucks and other vehicles. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the current conduct of our business operations, including personal injury, customer contract, employment claims such as claims alleging violations of, and\ndamages under, the FLSA and environmental matters as described in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We maintain insurance coverage providing indemnification against many of such claims, and we do not expect that we will sustain any material loss as a result thereof.\nIn addition, we, like our competitors, are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and other substances. In particular, industrial laundries currently use and must dispose of detergent waste water and other residues, and, in the past, have used perchloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents. We have settled, or contributed to the settlement of, past actions or claims brought against us relating to the disposal of hazardous materials at several sites and there can be no assurance that we will not have to expend material amounts to remediate the consequences of any such disposal in the future. Further, under environmental laws, an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in or emanating from such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. There can be no assurance that our acquired or leased locations have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon us under such laws or expose us to third-party actions such as tort suits. Refer to Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot Applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nCommon Stock Information\nOur Common Stock trades on the NYSE under the symbol UNF, while our Class B Common Stock is not publicly traded. On July 12, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of Common Stock and $0.24 per share of Class B Common Stock. Both dividends were paid on September 28, 2022 to shareholders of record as of September 7, 2022. The amount and timing of any future dividend payment is subject to the approval of the Board of Directors each quarter.\nThe approximate number of shareholders of record of our Common Stock and Class B Common Stock as of October 21, 2022 was 53 and 46, respectively. We believe that the number of beneficial owners of our Common Stock is substantially greater than the number of record holders because a large portion of our Common Stock is held of record in broker street names.\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nThe following table sets forth information concerning our equity compensation plans as of August 27, 2022:\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nPlan category\nNumber of securities\nto be issued upon\nexercise of\noutstanding\noptions, warrants\nand rights (1)\nWeighted average\nexercise price\nof outstanding\noptions, warrants\nand rights (2)\nNumber of securities\nremaining available\nfor future issuance\nunder equity\ncompensation plans\n(excluding securities\nreferenced in\ncolumn (a))\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nEquity compensation plans approved by\nsecurity holders\n460,048\n$\n141.68\n173,581\nEquity compensation plans not approved by\nsecurity holders\n-\nN/A\n-\nTotal\n460,048\n173,581\n(1)Includes shares of Common Stock issuable upon vesting of restricted stock units.\n(2)Restricted stock units are not included in the weighted-average exercise price calculation because there is no exercise price associated with restricted stock units.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe following table provides information regarding our purchases of equity securities for the periods set forth therein:\n(a) Total\nNumber of\nShares of Stock\nPurchased(1)\n(b) Average\nPrice Paid per\nShare(1)\n(c) Total Number\nof Shares\nPurchased as\nPart of Publicly\nAnnounced Plans\nor Programs(1)\n(d) Maximum\nNumber (or\nApproximate\nDollar Value) of\nShares that May\nYet be Purchased\nUnder the Plans\nor Programs(1)\nMay 29, 2022 - June 25, 2022\n28,275\n$\n164.22\n28,275\n$\n66,956,250\nJune 26, 2022 - July 23, 2022\n47,775\n$\n166.59\n47,775\n$\n63,640,769\nJuly 24, 2022 - August 27, 2022\n-\n$\n-\n-\n$\n63,640,769\n76,050\n76,050\n(1)On January 2, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase from time to time up to $100.0 million of our outstanding shares of Common Stock. On October 18, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase from time to\ntime up to $100.0 million of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, inclusive of the amount which remained available under the existing share repurchase program approved in January 2019, which program has no scheduled expiration date. Repurchases made under the program, if any, will continue to be made in either the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including economic and market conditions, the trading price of our Common Stock, corporate liquidity requirements and priorities, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The share repurchase program has been funded to date using our available cash and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. In addition to the shares repurchased under our share repurchase program and reflected in the table, we repurchased 35,714 shares of Class B Common Stock for $168.00 per share in a privately negotiated transaction in July 2022.\nStock Performance Graph\nThe graph below compares the cumulative five-year total return on UniFirst Corporation's Common Stock with the Russell 2000 Index and a customized peer group of three companies that includes Aramark, Cintas Corporation and Rollins, Inc.

ITEM 6. RESERVED ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBusiness Overview\nUniFirst Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, hereunder referred to as we, our, the Company, or UniFirst, is one of the largest providers of workplace uniforms and protective work wear clothing in the United States. We design, manufacture, personalize, rent, clean, deliver, and sell a wide range of uniforms and protective clothing, including shirts, pants, jackets, coveralls, lab coats, smocks, aprons and specialized protective wear, such as flame resistant and high visibility garments. We also rent and sell industrial wiping products, floor mats, facility service products and other non-garment items, and provide restroom and cleaning supplies and first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies as well as provide certain safety training to a variety of manufacturers, retailers and service companies.\nWe serve businesses of all sizes in numerous industry categories. Typical customers include automobile service centers and dealers, delivery services, food and general merchandise retailers, food processors and service operations, light manufacturers, maintenance facilities, restaurants, service companies, soft and durable goods wholesalers, transportation companies, healthcare providers and others who require employee clothing for image, identification, protection or utility purposes. We also provide our customers with restroom and cleaning supplies, including air fresheners, paper products and hand soaps.\nAt certain specialized facilities, we also decontaminate and clean work clothes and other items that may have been exposed to radioactive materials and service special cleanroom protective wear and facilities. Typical customers for these specialized services include government agencies, research and development laboratories, high technology companies and utilities operating nuclear reactors.\nHeadquartered in Wilmington, Massachusetts, we are a North American leader in the supply and servicing of uniform and workwear programs, as well as the delivery of facility service programs. Together with our subsidiaries, we also provide first aid and safety products, and manage specialized garment programs for the cleanroom and nuclear industries. We manufacture our own branded workwear, protective clothing, and floorcare products, as well as offer products from industry leading suppliers; and with 260 service locations, over 300,000 customer locations, and 14,000 employee Team Partners, we outfit more than 2 million workers each business day.\nU.S. GAAP establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information of those segments to be presented in interim financial reports issued to shareholders. Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. Our chief operating decision-maker is our Chief Executive Officer. We have six operating segments based on the information reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer: U.S. Rental and Cleaning, Canadian Rental and Cleaning, Manufacturing (MFG), Specialty Garments Rental and Cleaning (Specialty Garments), First Aid and Corporate. The U.S. Rental and Cleaning and Canadian Rental and Cleaning operating segments have been combined to form the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment. Refer to Note 15, Segment Reporting, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for our disclosure of segment information.\nThe U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment purchases, rents, cleans, delivers and sells, uniforms and protective clothing and non-garment items in the United States and Canada. The operations of the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment are referred to by us as our \u2018industrial laundry operations and we refer to the locations related to this reporting segment as our \u2018industrial laundries.\nThe MFG operating segment designs and manufactures uniforms and non-garment items primarily for the purpose of providing these goods to the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment. The amounts reflected as revenues of MFG are primarily generated when goods are shipped from our manufacturing facilities, or subcontract manufacturers, to our other locations. These intercompany revenues are recorded at a transfer price which is typically in excess of the actual manufacturing cost. Products are carried in inventory and subsequently placed in service and amortized at this transfer price. On a consolidated basis, intercompany MFG revenues and MFG income are eliminated and the carrying value of inventories and rental merchandise in service is reduced to the manufacturing cost. Income before income taxes from MFG, net of the intercompany MFG elimination, offsets the merchandise amortization costs incurred by the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment as the merchandise costs of this reporting segment are amortized and recognized based on inventories purchased from MFG at the transfer price which is above our manufacturing cost.\nThe Corporate operating segment consists of costs associated with our distribution center, sales and marketing, information systems, engineering, materials management, manufacturing planning, finance, budgeting, human resources, other general and administrative costs and interest expense. The revenues generated from the Corporate operating segment represent certain direct sales made directly from our distribution center. The products sold by this operating segment are the same products rented and sold by the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment. In the segment disclosures in Note 15, Segment Reporting, of our Consolidated Financial Statements, no assets or capital expenditures are presented for the Corporate operating segment as no assets are allocated to this operating segment in the information reviewed by our chief\nexecutive officer. However, depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets are reflected in income from operations and income before income taxes for the Corporate operating segment. The assets that give rise to this depreciation and amortization are included in the total assets of the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment as this is how they are tracked and reviewed by us.\nWe refer to our U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning, MFG, and Corporate segments combined as our Core Laundry Operations.\nThe Specialty Garments operating segment purchases, rents, cleans, delivers and sells, specialty garments and non-garment items primarily for nuclear and cleanroom applications and provides cleanroom cleaning services at limited customer locations. The First Aid operating segment sells first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies as well as maintains wholesale distribution and pill packaging operations.\nApproximately 88.5% of our revenues in fiscal 2022 were derived from our U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning and Corporate segments. A key driver of this business is the number of workers employed by our customers. Our revenues are directly impacted by fluctuations in these employment levels. Revenues from Specialty Garments, which accounted for approximately 7.6% of our fiscal 2022 revenues, increase during outages and refueling by nuclear power plants, as garment usage increases at these times. First Aid represented approximately 3.9% of our total revenues in fiscal 2022.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We utilize key estimates in preparing the financial statements, including casualty and environmental estimates, recoverability of goodwill, intangibles, income taxes and long-lived assets. These estimates are based on historical information, current trends, and information available from other sources. Our results are affected by economic, political, legislative, regulatory and legal actions. Economic conditions, such as recessionary trends, inflation, interest and monetary exchange rates, government fiscal policies, government policies surrounding the containment of COVID-19 and changes in the prices of raw materials, can have a significant effect on operations. These factors and other events could cause actual results to differ from management's estimates.\nRevenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe recognize revenue from rental operations and related services in the period in which the services are provided. Direct sale revenue is recognized in the period in which the services are performed or when the product is shipped. Our judgment and estimates are used in determining the collectability of accounts receivable and evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts as well as our sales credits reserve. We consider specific accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and the age of outstanding balances as part of our evaluation in assessing the allowance for doubtful accounts. We consider our historical credit experience in assessing the sales credits reserve. Changes in our estimates are reflected in the period they become known. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Material changes in our estimates may result in significant differences in the amount and timing of bad debt expense recognition for any given period. Our revenues do not include taxes we collect from our customers and remit to governmental authorities.\nCosts to Obtain a Contract\nWe defer commission expenses paid to employee-partners when the commissions are deemed to be incremental for obtaining the route servicing customer contract. The deferred commissions are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which is generally the estimated life of the customer relationship. We review the deferred commission balances for impairment on an ongoing basis. Deferred commissions are classified as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect to recognize the expense. The current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the non-current portion is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. As of August 27, 2022, the current and non-current assets related to deferred commissions totaled $15.2 million and $65.1 million, respectively. As of August 28, 2021, the current and non-current assets related to deferred commissions totaled $14.2 million and $60.6 million, respectively. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we recorded $15.4 million and $14.4 million, respectively, of amortization expense related to deferred commissions. This expense is classified in selling and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income.\nInventories and Rental Merchandise in Service\nOur inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, net of any reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. Judgments and estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to our customers or used in our rental operations. Historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both excess and obsolete inventories. If actual product demand and market conditions are less favorable than the amount we projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required. We use the first-in, first-out method to value our inventories, which primarily consist of finished goods. Rental merchandise in service is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives of the merchandise, which range from six to thirty-six months. In establishing estimated lives for merchandise in service, our management considers historical experience and the intended use of the merchandise. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of operating profit for any period if we make significant changes to our estimates.\nGoodwill, Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, we do not amortize goodwill. Instead, we test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Our evaluation considers changes in the operating environment, competitive information, market trends, operating performance and cash flow modeling.\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 and the last day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. There have been no impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets in fiscal 2022, 2021 or 2020.\nWe cannot predict future economic conditions and their impact on the Company or the future net realizable value of our stock. A decline in our market capitalization and/or deterioration in general economic conditions could negatively and materially impact our assumptions and assessment of the fair value of our business. If general economic conditions or our financial performance deteriorate, we may be required to record a goodwill impairment charge in the future which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nProperty, plant and equipment, and definite-lived intangible assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on our estimates of the period that the assets will generate economic benefits. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired. There were no material impairments of long-lived assets in fiscal 2022, 2021 or 2020.\nInsurance\nWe self-insure for certain obligations related to healthcare, workers compensation, vehicles and general liability programs. We also purchase stop-loss insurance policies for workers compensation, vehicles and general liability programs to protect ourselves from catastrophic losses. Judgments and estimates are used in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for events that have occurred but have not been reported. Our estimates consider historical claim experience and other factors. Our liabilities are based on our estimates, and, while we believe that our accruals are adequate, the ultimate liability may be significantly different from the amounts recorded. In certain cases where partial insurance coverage exists, we must estimate the portion of the liability that will be covered by existing insurance policies to arrive at our net expected liability. Receivables for insurance recoveries are recorded as assets, on an undiscounted basis. Changes in our claim experience, our ability to settle claims or other estimates and judgments we use could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any given period.\nEnvironmental and Other Contingencies\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of our business operations, including environmental matters, personal injury, customer contract matters and employment claims. U.S. GAAP requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred, and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. We regularly consult with our attorneys and outside consultants, in our consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, before recording a contingent liability. We record accruals for environmental and other contingencies based on enacted laws, regulatory orders or decrees, our estimates of costs, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, the timing of payments, and the input of our attorneys and outside consultants.\nThe estimated liability for environmental contingencies has been discounted as of August 27, 2022 using risk-free interest rates ranging from 3.0% to 3.4% over periods ranging from ten to thirty years. The estimated current costs, net of legal settlements with insurance carriers, have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at 3.0% per year. Changes in\nenacted laws, regulatory orders or decrees, our estimates of costs, risk-free interest rates, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, the timing of payments, the input of our attorneys and outside consultants or other factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for our environmental and other contingent liabilities. Refer to Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion and analysis.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nUnder U.S. GAAP, asset retirement obligations generally apply to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or the normal operation of a long-lived asset. Current accounting guidance requires that we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset.\nWe have recognized as a liability the present value of the estimated future costs to decommission our nuclear laundry facilities in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We depreciate, on a straight-line basis, the amount added to property, plant and equipment and recognize accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the various remaining lives which range from approximately one to twenty-two years.\nOur estimated liability has been based on historical experience in decommissioning nuclear laundry facilities, estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, external vendor estimates as to the cost to decommission these assets in the future, and federal and state regulatory requirements. The estimated current costs have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at 3% per year. The liability has been discounted using credit-adjusted risk-free rates that range from approximately 7.0% to 7.5%. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in the estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, estimated dates of decommissioning, changes in decommissioning costs, changes in federal or state regulatory guidance on the decommissioning of such facilities, or other changes in estimates. Changes due to revisions in our estimates are recognized by adjusting the carrying amount of the liability and the related long-lived asset if the assets are still in service or charged to expense in the period if the assets are no longer in service.\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plan and other Pension Plans\nWe recognize pension expense on an accrual basis over our employees estimated service periods. Pension expense is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements.\nThe calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires us to use a number of critical assumptions, including the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, the assumed discount rate, the assumed rate of compensation increases and life expectancy of participants. Changes in our assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual expense can differ from these assumptions. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future.\nIncome Taxes\nWe compute income tax expense by jurisdiction based on our operations in each jurisdiction. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the amounts recognized for income tax and financial reporting purposes at currently enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. See Note 4, Income Taxes of our Consolidated Financial Statements for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes. We regularly review deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets will be realized.\nWe are periodically reviewed by U.S. domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews typically include inquiries regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, we record estimated reserves. Refer to Note 4, Income Taxes, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our accounting for income taxes and our uncertain tax positions for financial accounting purposes.\nEffects of Inflation and Current Economic Conditions\nIn general, we believe that our results of operations are not dependent on moderate changes in the inflation rate. Historically, we have been able to manage the impacts of more significant changes in inflation rates through our customer relationships, customer agreements that generally provide for price increases consistent with the rate of inflation and continued focus on improvements of operational productivity. However, the current inflationary environment has had a negative impact on our margins, including as a result of increased energy costs for our vehicles and our plants, as well as increasing wages in the labor markets in which we compete. We expect that inflation will continue to pressure our margins in future periods. In addition, in response to the concerns over inflation risk in the broader U.S. economy, the U.S. Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates in March 2022 for the first time in over three years, and has continued to increase interest rates throughout 2022 and may continue to do so in the future. It is possible that dramatic increases in interest rates may ultimately result in an economic recession. Adverse economic conditions resulting from inflationary pressures, U.S. Federal Reserve actions, geopolitical issues or otherwise are difficult to predict and may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nPlease see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an additional discussion of risks and potential risks of inflation and adverse economic conditions on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCOVID-19 Assessment\nAt times during the global COVID-19 pandemic, our revenues have been significantly adversely impacted as a result of many customers closing their businesses or operating at limited capacities. In addition, at times during the pandemic, we have experienced supply chain disruptions with respect to certain products, including hand sanitizer and masks. Although there continues to be supply chain disruption and increased costs for supplies that is impacting our operating results, including as a result of Russias invasion of Ukraine, these adverse impacts and disruptions have declined since the height of the pandemic.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic has continued, instances of new COVID-19 cases have risen periodically with the outbreak of various COVID-19 variants, and new COVID-19 variants could emerge and spread in the future and have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe remain focused on the safety and well-being of our team partners and on the service of our customers. We will continue to review and assess the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on our team partners, our customers, our suppliers and our business so that we can seek to address the impacts on our business and service our customers.\nPlease see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an additional discussion of risks and potential risks of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents certain selected financial data, including the percentage of revenues represented by each item, for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n% Change\n(In thousands, except for percentages)\nFiscal\n% of\nRevenues\nFiscal\n% of\nRevenues\nFiscal\n% of\nRevenues\nFiscal 2022\nvs.\nFiscal 2021\nFiscal 2021\nvs.\nFiscal 2020\nRevenues\n$\n2,000,822\n100.0\n%\n$\n1,826,216\n100.0\n%\n$\n1,804,159\n100.0\n%\n9.6\n%\n1.2\n%\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue (1)\n1,306,451\n65.3\n1,141,275\n62.5\n1,164,932\n64.6\n14.5\n(2.0\n)\nSelling and administrative\nexpenses (1)\n451,243\n22.6\n383,161\n21.0\n361,801\n20.1\n17.8\n5.9\nDepreciation and amortization\n108,777\n5.4\n105,955\n5.8\n104,697\n5.8\n2.7\n1.2\n1,866,471\n93.3\n1,630,391\n89.3\n1,631,430\n90.4\n14.5\n(0.1\n)\nOperating income\n134,351\n6.7\n195,825\n10.7\n172,729\n9.6\n(31.4\n)\n13.4\nOther (income) expense, net\n0.0\n(1,046\n)\n(0.1\n)\n(5,159\n)\n(0.3\n)\n(102.5\n)\n(79.7\n)\nIncome before income taxes\n134,325\n6.7\n196,871\n10.8\n177,888\n9.9\n(31.8\n)\n10.7\nProvision for income taxes\n30,921\n1.5\n45,760\n2.5\n42,118\n2.3\n(32.4\n)\n8.6\nNet income\n$\n103,404\n5.2\n%\n$\n151,111\n8.3\n%\n$\n135,770\n7.5\n%\n(31.6\n)%\n11.3\n%\n(1)Exclusive of depreciation on our property, plant and equipment and amortization of our intangible assets.\nRevenues and income (loss) from operations by reporting segment for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 are presented in the following table.

We also rent industrial wiping products, floor mats, facility service products, other non-garment items, and provide restroom and cleaning supplies and first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies, to a variety of manufacturers, retailers and service companies.\nCost of revenues include the amortization of rental merchandise in service and merchandise costs related to direct sales as well as labor and other production, service and delivery costs, and distribution costs associated with operating our Core Laundry Operations, Specialty Garments facilities, and First Aid locations. Selling and administrative costs include costs related to our sales and marketing functions as well as general and administrative costs associated with our corporate offices, non-operating environmental sites and operating locations including information systems, engineering, materials management, manufacturing planning, finance, budgeting, and human resources.\nOur operating results are also directly impacted by the costs of the gasoline used to fuel our vehicles and the natural gas used to operate our plants. Our operating margins have been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by the recent surge in energy prices. In addition, as described above, the current inflationary environment has had a negative impact on our margins, and we expect that it will continue to pressure our margins in future periods.\nOur business is subject to various state and federal regulations, including employment laws and regulations, minimum wage requirements, overtime requirements, working condition requirements, citizenship requirements, healthcare insurance mandates and other laws and regulations that impact our labor costs. Labor costs have increased recently as a result of increases in state and local minimum wage levels as well as the overall impact of wage pressure as the result of a low unemployment environment.\nA portion of our sales is derived from international markets, including Canada. Revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar represented approximately 7.9%, 8.4% and 6.9% of total consolidated revenues for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The operating results of our international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars and such results are affected by movements in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, a weaker Canadian dollar increases the costs to our Canadian operations of merchandise and other operational inputs that are sourced from outside\nCanada, which has the effect of reducing the operating margins of our Canadian business if we are unable to recover these additional costs through price adjustments with our Canadian customers. In fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, foreign currency fluctuations impacted our consolidated revenues negatively by 0.1%, 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively. These impacts were primarily driven by fluctuations in the Canadian dollar. Our operating results in future years could be negatively impacted by any further devaluation, as compared to the U.S. dollar, of the Canadian dollar or any of the currencies of the other countries in which we operate.\nOn October 20, 2021, we announced that we would be raising our quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share for Common Stock and to $0.24 per share for Class B Common Stock. The amount and timing of any future dividend payment is subject to the approval of the Board of Directors each quarter.\nOn January 2, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase from time to time up to $100.0 million of its outstanding shares of Common Stock. The share repurchase program was funded with available cash.\nOn October 18, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to $100.0 million of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, inclusive of the amount which remained available under the existing share repurchase program approved on January 2, 2019. Repurchases made under the program, if any, will be made in either the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including economic and market conditions, the Company stock price, corporate liquidity requirements and priorities, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The share repurchase program may be funded using available cash or capacity under our 2021 Credit Agreement (as defined below) and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal 2022, we repurchased 0.2 million shares of Common Stock for an average price per share of $179.98. During fiscal 2021, we repurchased 0.1 million shares for an average price per share of $184.13. During fiscal 2020, we repurchased 0.1 million shares for an average price per share of $184.67. As of August 27, 2022, we had $63.6 million remaining under our current share repurchase program.\nIn fiscal 2018, we initiated a multiyear CRM project to further develop, implement and deploy a third-party application we licensed. This new solution is intended to improve functionality, capability and information flow as well as increase automation in servicing our customers. As of August 27, 2022, we have capitalized $40.9 million related to our new CRM project. We began deployment of our new CRM project during the second half of fiscal 2021 and anticipate this will continue through fiscal 2023. We are depreciating this system over a 10-year life and recognized $3.2 million and $1.4 million of amortization expense in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.\nOver the next few years, we intend to focus on three discrete strategic initiatives that are critical in our efforts to transform the company in terms of our overall capabilities and competitive positioning. These initiatives are the continued rollout of our new CRM system (discussed above), investments in the UniFirst brand, and a corporate-wide enterprise resource planning (ERP) system with a strong focus on supply chain and procurement automation and technology. We refer to these initiatives together as our Key Initiatives. For fiscal 2022, we incurred $19.7 million, $11.7 million and $1.7 million of costs related to our CRM system, UniFirst branding project and ERP system, respectively, for a total of $33.1 million directly attributable to our Key Initiatives.\nOur fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in August. For financial reporting purposes fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 all consisted of 52 weeks.\nFiscal Year Ended August 27, 2022 Compared with Fiscal Year Ended August 28, 2021\nRevenues\nFiscal\nFiscal\nDollar\nChange\nPercent\nChange\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nCore Laundry Operations\n$\n1,770,502\n$\n1,615,560\n$\n154,942\n9.6\n%\nSpecialty Garments\n152,885\n145,454\n7,431\n5.1\n%\nFirst Aid\n77,435\n65,202\n12,233\n18.8\n%\nTotal consolidated revenues\n$\n2,000,822\n$\n1,826,216\n$\n174,606\n9.6\n%\nCore Laundry Operations revenues for fiscal 2022 increased compared to the prior fiscal year.

In addition, we incurred higher energy costs as a percentage of revenues due to a surge in energy costs and elevated labor costs due to a very challenging employment environment.\nSpecialty Garments cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior year due primarily to higher merchandise, labor, and energy costs as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2022.\nSelling and administrative expenses\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nFiscal 2022\nFiscal 2021\nDollar\nChange\nPercent\nChange\nSelling and administrative expenses\n$\n451,243\n$\n383,161\n$\n68,082\n17.8\n%\n% of Revenues\n22.6\n%\n21.0\n%\nOur selling and administrative costs increased as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to costs we incurred related to our CRM, ERP and branding initiatives as well as higher labor costs as a percentage of revenues due to a very challenging employment environment.\nDepreciation and amortization\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nFiscal 2022\nFiscal 2021\nDollar\nChange\nPercent\nChange\nDepreciation and amortization\n$\n108,777\n$\n105,955\n$\n2,822\n2.7\n%\n% of Revenues\n5.4\n%\n5.8\n%\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased in fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year due primarily to continued investment in our infrastructure and technology initiatives.\nIncome from operations\nFor fiscal 2022, the changes in revenues in our Core Laundry Operations, Specialty Garments and First Aid segments, as well as the changes in our costs discussed above, resulted in the following changes in our income from operations:\nFiscal\nFiscal\nDollar\nChange\nPercent\nChange\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nCore Laundry Operations\n$\n110,710\n$\n171,717\n$\n(61,007\n)\n(35.5\n)%\nSpecialty Garments\n23,658\n24,801\n(1,143\n)\n(4.6\n)%\nFirst Aid\n(17\n)\n(693\n)\n(97.5\n)%\nTotal consolidated income from operations\n$\n134,351\n$\n195,825\n$\n(61,474\n)\n(31.4\n)%\nPercentage of total revenues\n6.7\n%\n10.7\n%\nOther (income) expense, net\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nFiscal 2022\nFiscal 2021\nDollar\nChange\nPercent\nChange\nInterest income, net\n$\n(2,851\n)\n$\n(2,568\n)\n$\n(283\n)\n11.0\n%\nOther expense, net\n2,877\n1,522\n1,355\n89.0\n%\nTotal other (income) expense, net\n$\n$\n(1,046\n)\n$\n1,072\n(102.5\n)%\nThe decrease in other (income) expense, net, in fiscal 2022 compared to the prior fiscal year was due primarily to larger foreign exchange losses in fiscal 2022.\nProvision for income taxes\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nFiscal 2022\nFiscal 2021\nDollar\nChange\nPercent\nChange\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n30,921\n$\n45,760\n$\n(14,839\n)\n(32.4\n)%\nEffective income tax rate\n23.0\n%\n23.2\n%\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 remained consistent with fiscal 2021.\nFiscal Year Ended August 28, 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year Ended August 29, 2020\nRevenues\nFiscal\nFiscal\nDollar\nChange\nPercent\nChange\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nCore Laundry Operations\n$\n1,615,560\n$\n1,601,485\n$\n14,075\n0.9\n%\nSpecialty Garments\n145,454\n133,185\n12,269\n9.2\n%\nFirst Aid\n65,202\n69,489\n(4,287\n)\n(6.2\n)%\nTotal consolidated revenues\n$\n1,826,216\n$\n1,804,159\n$\n22,057\n1.2\n%\nThe increase in our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily driven by the significant adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2020, including from COVID-19-related customer closures as well as related wearer reductions at customers that remained open. The impact on the prior fiscal year was partially offset by a large direct sale of $20.1 million.\nThe Specialty Garments segments results are often affected by seasonality and the timing and length of its customers power reactor outages as well as its project-based activities. The improvement in revenues in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior fiscal year was due primarily to growth in our cleanroom operations and our European nuclear operations.\nThe decrease in our First Aid revenues in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior fiscal year was due primarily to reduced sales from the segments wholesale distribution business coming off of an exceptionally strong year in fiscal 2020 driven by increased demand for the segments safety and personal protective equipment offerings as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in fiscal 2020, which were partially offset by increased sales in our van business in fiscal 2021.\nCost of revenues\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nFiscal 2021\nFiscal 2020\nDollar\nChange\nPercent\nChange\nCost of revenues\n1,141,275\n1,164,932\n-23,657\n-2.0\n%\n% of Revenues\n62.5\n%\n64.6\n%\nCore Laundry Operations cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2021 decreased from the prior fiscal year.

We generated $122.6 million and $212.3 million in cash from operating activities in the fiscal years ended August 27, 2022 and August 28, 2021, respectively.\nPursuant to our share repurchase program, we repurchased 0.2 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of approximately $38.4 million during fiscal 2022, 0.1 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of approximately $11.2 million during fiscal 2021 and 0.1 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate $21.7 million during fiscal 2020. On July 15, 2022, we repurchased 35,714 shares of Class B Common Stock for $6.0 million in a privately negotiated transaction at a per share price of $168.00.\nWe believe, although there can be no assurance, that our current cash and cash equivalents balances, our cash generated from future operations and amounts available under our 2021 Credit Agreement (as defined below) will be sufficient to meet our current anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months and will help us manage the impacts of inflation and address related liquidity needs.\nCash flows provided by operating activities have historically been the primary source of our liquidity. We generally use these cash flows to fund most, if not all, of our operations, capital expenditure and acquisition activities as well as dividends on our Common Stock.

The decrease in accrued liabilities was due primarily to the payment of $12.2 million of United States Social Security and Medicare taxes that we deferred\nunder the Coronavirus Air, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) in fiscal years 2020 and 2021. The Company expects to pay the remaining $12.1 million of deferred United State Social Security and Medicare taxes by the end of calendar year 2022. The elevated inventories related to the supply chain disruption and the increased merchandise in service are attributable to our balance sheet position continuing to normalize coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic impacted period. The increase in accounts receivable was due in part to our revenue growth during the fiscal year. The increase in prepaid income taxes was due primarily to excess payments made for fiscal 2022 income taxes.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nThe net increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2022 was due primarily to an increase in acquisition related activity of $35.8 million as compared to fiscal 2021.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities\nThe increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 was due primarily to incremental cash used for repurchases of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock of $33.2 million and an increase in dividends paid of $2.6 million.\nLong-term Debt and Borrowing Capacity\nOn March 26, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated $175.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement (the 2021 Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, which matures on March 26, 2026. The 2021 Credit Agreement amended and restated our $250.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement, which was scheduled to mature on April 11, 2021. Under the 2021 Credit Agreement, we may borrow funds at variable interest rates based on, at our election, the Eurodollar rate or a base rate, plus in each case a spread based on our consolidated funded debt ratio. Availability of credit requires compliance with certain financial and other covenants, including a maximum consolidated funded debt ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio, each as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement. We test our compliance with these financial covenants on a fiscal quarterly basis. As of August 27, 2022, the interest rates applicable to our borrowings under the 2021 Credit Agreement would be calculated as LIBOR plus 1.00% at the time of the respective borrowing. As of August 27, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings and had outstanding letters of credit amounting to $60.8 million, leaving $114.2 million available for borrowing under the 2021 Credit Agreement.\nAs of August 27, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants under the 2021 Credit Agreement.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nIn June 2018, we entered into twelve forward contracts to exchange CAD for U.S. dollars at fixed exchange rates in order to manage our exposure related to certain forecasted CAD denominated sales of one of our subsidiaries. The hedged transactions are specified as the first amount of CAD denominated revenues invoiced by one of our domestic subsidiaries each fiscal quarter, beginning in the third fiscal quarter of 2019 and continuing through the second fiscal quarter of 2022. In total, we sold approximately 12.1 million CAD at an average Canadian-dollar exchange rate of 0.7814 over these quarterly periods. We concluded that the forward contracts met the criteria to qualify as a cash flow hedge under U.S. GAAP. These forward contracts matured on February 25, 2022.\nIn August 2021, we entered into twenty forward contracts to exchange CAD for U.S. dollars at fixed exchange rates in order to manage our exposure related to certain forecasted CAD denominated sales of one of our subsidiaries. The hedged transactions are specified as the first amount of CAD denominated revenues invoiced by one of our domestic subsidiaries each fiscal quarter, beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2022 and continuing through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2026. In total, we will sell approximately 14.1 million CAD at an average Canadian-dollar exchange rate of 0.7861 over these quarterly periods. We concluded that the forward contracts met the criteria to qualify as a cash flow hedge under U.S. GAAP.\nAs of August 27, 2022, we had forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 7.2 million CAD outstanding and recorded the fair value of the contracts of $0.1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets with a corresponding $0.1 million loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which was recorded net of tax. During fiscal 2022, we reclassified $0.1 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to revenue, related to the derivative financial instruments. The loss on these forward contracts that results in an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss as of August 27, 2022 is expected to be reclassified to revenues prior to their maturity on February 25, 2022 and August 29, 2026, respectively.\nEnvironmental and Legal Contingencies\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and other substances. In particular, industrial laundries currently use and must dispose of detergent waste water and other residues, and, in the past, used perchloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents. We are attentive to the environmental concerns surrounding the disposal of these materials and have, through the years, taken measures to avoid their improper disposal. We have settled, or contributed to the settlement of, past actions or claims brought against us relating to the disposal of hazardous materials at several sites and there can be no assurance that we will not have to expend material amounts to remediate the consequences of any such disposal in the future.\nU.S. GAAP requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. We regularly consult with attorneys and outside consultants in our consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances before recording a contingent liability. Changes in enacted laws, regulatory orders or decrees, our estimates of costs, risk-free interest rates, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, the timing of payments, the input of our attorneys and outside consultants or other factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for our environmental and other contingent liabilities.\nUnder environmental laws, an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on, or in, or emanating from, such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. There can be no assurances that acquired or leased locations have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon our Company under such laws or expose our Company to third party actions such as tort suits. We continue to address environmental conditions under terms of consent orders negotiated with the applicable environmental authorities or otherwise with respect to certain sites.\nWe have accrued certain costs related to certain sites, including but not limited to, sites in Woburn and Somerville, Massachusetts, as it has been determined that the costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We, together with multiple other companies, are party to a consent decree related to our property and the Central Area in Woburn, Massachusetts. The EPA has provided us and other signatories to the consent decree with comments on the design and implementation of groundwater and soil remedies at the Woburn site and investigation of environmental conditions in the Central Area. The consent decree does not address any remediation work that may be required in the Central Area. We, and other signatories, have implemented and proposed to do additional work at the Woburn site but many of the EPAs comments remain to be resolved. We have accrued costs to perform certain work responsive to the EPAs comments. Additionally, we have implemented mitigation measures and continue to monitor environmental conditions at a site in Somerville, Massachusetts. We have agreed to undertake additional actions responsive to a notice of audit findings from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection concerning a regulatory submittal that we made in 2009 for a portion of the site. We have received demands from the local transit authority for reimbursement of certain costs associated with its construction of a new municipal transit station in the area of the Somerville site. This station is part of an ongoing extension of the transit system. We have reserved for costs in connection with this matter; however, in light of the uncertainties associated with this matter, these costs and the related reserve may change.\nWe routinely review and evaluate sites that may require remediation and monitoring and determine our estimated costs based on various estimates and assumptions. These estimates are developed using our internal sources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on:\nManagements judgment and experience in remediating and monitoring our sites;\nInformation available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation and monitoring;\nThe number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) who may be liable for remediation and monitoring of a specific site; and\nThe typical allocation of costs among PRPs.\nThere is usually a range of reasonable estimates of the costs associated with each site. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, our accruals represent the amount within the range that we believe is the best estimate or the low end of a range of estimates if no point within the range is a better estimate. When we believe that both the amount of a particular liability and the timing of the payments are reliably determinable, we adjust the cost in current dollars using a rate of 3% for inflation until the time of expected payment and discount the cost to present value using current risk-free interest rates. As of August 27, 2022, the risk-free interest rates we utilized ranged from 3.0% to 3.4%.\nFor environmental liabilities that have been discounted, we include interest accretion, based on the effective interest method, in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The changes to the amounts of our environmental liabilities for the years ended August 27, 2022 and August 28, 2021 are as follows (in thousands):\nYear ended\nAugust 27,\nAugust 28,\nBeginning balance\n$\n32,859\n$\n30,702\nCosts incurred for which reserves have been provided\n$\n(2,188\n)\n(1,593\n)\nInsurance proceeds\n$\nInterest accretion\n$\nChanges in discount rates\n$\n(3,235\n)\n(1,040\n)\nRevisions in estimates\n$\n4,024\n4,213\nEnding balance\n$\n32,191\n$\n32,859\nAnticipated payments and insurance proceeds of currently identified environmental remediation liabilities as of August 27, 2022 for the next five fiscal years and thereafter, as measured in current dollars, are reflected below (in thousands).\nFiscal year ended August\nThereafter\nTotal\nEstimated costs-current dollars\n$\n12,130\n$\n3,051\n$\n1,741\n$\n1,437\n$\n1,250\n$\n14,947\n$\n34,556\nEstimated insurance proceeds\n(173\n)\n(159\n)\n(173\n)\n(159\n)\n(173\n)\n(230\n)\n(1,067\n)\nNet anticipated costs\n$\n11,957\n$\n2,892\n$\n1,568\n$\n1,278\n$\n1,077\n$\n14,717\n$\n33,489\nEffect of inflation\n9,388\nEffect of discounting\n(10,686\n)\nBalance as of August 27, 2022\n$\n32,191\nEstimated insurance proceeds are primarily received from an annuity received as part of our legal settlement with an insurance company. Annual proceeds of approximately $0.3 million are deposited into an escrow account which funds remediation and monitoring costs for two sites related to our former operations. Annual proceeds received but not expended in the current year accumulate in this account and may be used in future years for costs related to this site through the year 2027. As of August 27, 2022, the balance in this escrow account, which is held in a trust and is not recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, was approximately $4.8 million. Also included in estimated insurance proceeds are amounts we are entitled to receive pursuant to legal settlements as reimbursements from three insurance companies for estimated costs at one of our sites.\nOur nuclear garment decontamination facilities are licensed by respective state agencies, as delegated authority by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the NRC) pursuant to the NRCs Agreement State program and are subject to applicable federal and state radioactive material regulations. In addition, our international locations (Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union) are regulated by equivalent respective jurisdictional authorities. There can be no assurance that such regulation will not lead to material disruptions in our garment decontamination business.\nFrom time to time, we are also subject to legal and regulatory proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of our business operations, including personal injury claims, customer contract matters, employment claims and environmental matters as described above.\nWe are subject to two actions filed by former employees in September 2022 alleging damages under the Fair Labor Standards Act. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to such allegations and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in such matters. While we are unable to ascertain the ultimate outcome of such actions, based on the information currently available, we believe that a loss with respect to such matters is neither probable nor remote. Given the uncertainty associated with the ultimate resolution of such matters, we are unable to reasonably assess an estimate or range of estimates of any potential losses.\nIn addition, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Mexican federal tax authority issued a tax assessment on our subsidiary in Mexico for fiscal 2016 import taxes, value added taxes and custom processing fees of over $17.0 million, plus surcharges, fines and penalties of over $67.7 million for a total assessment of over $84.7 million. We disagree with such tax assessment and have filed an administrative appeal before the legal division of the Mexican federal tax authority challenging the validity of the tax assessment. While we are unable to ascertain the ultimate outcome of this matter, based on the information currently available, we believe that a loss with respect to this matter is neither probable nor remote. Given the uncertainty associated with the ultimate resolution of this matter, we are unable to reasonably assess an estimate or range of estimates of any potential losses.\nWhile it is impossible for us to ascertain the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to contingent liabilities, including lawsuits and environmental contingencies, we believe that the aggregate amount of such liabilities, if any, in excess of amounts covered by insurance have been properly accrued in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. It is possible, however, that the future financial position and/or results of operations for any particular future period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or strategies related to these contingencies or changes out of our control.\nAcquisitions\nAs part of our business, we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other garment service companies. In recent years, we have typically paid for acquisitions with cash and may continue to do so in the future. To pay for an acquisition, we may use cash on hand, cash generated from operations or borrowings under our 2021 Credit Agreement, or we may pursue other forms of debt financing. Our ability to secure short-term and long-term debt financing in the future will depend on several factors, including our future profitability, our levels of debt and equity, and the overall credit and equity market environments.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments\nThe following information is presented as of August 27, 2022 (in thousands).\nPayments Due by Fiscal Period\nContractual Obligations\nTotal\nLess than\n1 year\n1 - 3 years\n3 - 5 years\nMore than\n5 years\nRetirement plan benefit payments\n$\n31,399\n$\n2,092\n$\n3,612\n$\n3,956\n$\n21,739\nAsset retirement obligations\n14,887\n-\n3,798\n11,089\n-\nOperating leases\n53,493\n14,318\n21,321\n12,722\n5,132\nForward contracts\n5,596\n1,399\n2,448\n1,749\n-\nPurchase Commitments*\n56,470\n39,740\n8,477\n3,952\n4,301\nTotal contractual cash obligations\n$\n161,845\n$\n57,549\n$\n39,656\n$\n33,468\n$\n31,172\n*Includes non-cancellable purchase commitments for inventories, software, and services.\nWe have uncertain tax positions that are reserved totaling $9.3 million as of August 27, 2022 that are excluded from the above table as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority.\nWe have accrued $32.2 million in costs related to certain environmental obligations we have to address under terms of consent orders negotiated with the applicable environmental authorities or otherwise. Refer to Environmental and Legal Contingencies, above for additional discussion on our environmental obligations.\nAs discussed above under Long-Term Debt and Borrowing Capacity, as of August 27, 2022, we had borrowing capacity of $175.0 million under our 2021 Credit Agreement, of which approximately $114.2 million was available for borrowing. Also, as of such date, we had no outstanding borrowings and letters of credit outstanding of $60.8 million. All letters of credit expire in less than one year.\nAs discussed above under Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as of August 27, 2022, we had forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 7.2 million CAD outstanding and recorded the fair value of the contracts of $0.1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets with a corresponding $0.1 million gain in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which was recorded net of tax. During fiscal 2022, we reclassified $0.1 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to revenue, related to the derivative financial instruments. The loss on these forward contracts that results in an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss as of August 27, 2022 is expected to be reclassified to revenues prior to their maturity on August 29, 2026.\nEnergy Costs\nSignificant increases in energy costs, specifically with respect to natural gas and gasoline, can materially affect our operating costs. During fiscal 2022, our energy costs, which include fuel, natural gas, and electricity, represented approximately 4.7% of our total revenue.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on recently implemented and issued accounting standards ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe have determined that all of our foreign subsidiaries operate primarily in local currencies that represent the functional currencies of such subsidiaries. All assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. The effects of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of assets and liabilities are recorded as a component of shareholders equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during each month of the fiscal year. As such, our financial condition and operating results are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to currencies in foreign countries. Revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar represented approximately 7.9%, 8.4% and 6.9% of our total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Total assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar represented approximately 6.8% and 7.0% of our total consolidated assets at August 27, 2022 and August 28, 2021, respectively. If exchange rates had increased or decreased by 10% from the actual rates in effect during the fiscal year ended August 27, 2022, our revenues and assets for the year ended and as of August 27, 2022 would have increased or decreased by approximately $0.5 million and $16.4 million, respectively.\nIn June 2018, we entered into twelve forward contracts to exchange CAD for U.S. dollars at fixed exchange rates in order to manage our exposure related to certain forecasted CAD denominated sales of one of our subsidiaries. The hedged transactions are specified as the first amount of CAD denominated revenues invoiced by one of our domestic subsidiaries each fiscal quarter, beginning in the third fiscal quarter of 2019 and continuing through the second fiscal quarter of 2022. In total, we sold approximately 12.1 million CAD at an average Canadian-dollar exchange rate of 0.7814 over these quarterly periods. We concluded that the forward contracts met the criteria to qualify as a cash flow hedge under U.S. GAAP. These forward contracts matured on February 25, 2022.\nIn August 2021, we entered into twenty forward contracts to exchange CAD for U.S. dollars at fixed exchange rates in order to manage our exposure related to certain forecasted CAD denominated sales of one of our subsidiaries. The hedged transactions are specified as the first amount of CAD denominated revenues invoiced by one of our domestic subsidiaries each fiscal quarter, beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2022 and continuing through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2026. In total, we will sell approximately 14.1 million CAD at an average Canadian-dollar exchange rate of 0.7861 over these quarterly periods. We concluded that the forward contracts met the criteria to qualify as a cash flow hedge under U.S. GAAP.\nAs of August 27, 2022, we had forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 7.2 million CAD outstanding and recorded the fair value of the contracts of $0.1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets with a corresponding $0.1 million loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which was recorded net of tax. During fiscal 2022, we reclassified $0.1 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to revenue, related to the derivative financial instruments. The loss on these forward contracts that results in an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss as of August 27, 2022 is expected to be reclassified to revenues prior to their maturity on August 29, 2026.\nOther than the forward contracts discussed above, we do not operate a hedging program to mitigate the effect of a significant change in the value of the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, which include the Canadian dollar, euro, British pound, Mexican peso and Nicaraguan cordoba, as compared to the U.S. dollar. Any losses or gains resulting from unhedged foreign currency transactions, including exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany accounts are reported as transaction losses (gains) in our other expense, net. The intercompany payables and receivables are denominated in Canadian dollars, euros, British pounds, Mexican pesos and Nicaraguan cordobas. During the fiscal year ended August 27, 2022, transaction gains included in other expense, net, was $2.2 million. If exchange rates had changed by 10% during fiscal 2022, we would have recognized exchange gains or losses of approximately $0.4 million.\nPlease see Item 1A.

Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. There have been no material changes in the accounting policies followed by the Company during the current fiscal year other than the adoption of recent accounting pronouncements as discussed in greater detail in the Recent Accounting Pronouncements sub-section of this Note.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements is in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company utilizes key estimates in preparing the financial statements including casualty and environmental estimates, recoverability of goodwill, intangibles, income taxes and long-lived assets. These estimates are based on historical information, current trends, and information available from other sources. The Companys results are affected by economic, political, legislative, regulatory and legal actions. Economic conditions, such as recessionary trends, inflation, interest and monetary exchange rates, government fiscal policies, government policies surrounding the containment of COVID-19 and changes in the prices of raw materials, can have a significant effect on operations. These factors and other events could cause actual results to differ from management's estimates.\nFiscal Year\nThe Companys fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in August. For financial reporting purposes, fiscal years ended August 27, 2022 (fiscal 2022), August 28, 2021 (fiscal 2021) and August 29, 2020 (fiscal 2020) all consisted of 52 weeks.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and money market securities. As of each of August 27, 2022 and August 28, 2021, the Company had no short-term investments.\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable represents amounts due from customers and is presented net of reserves for expected credit losses. The Company utilizes its judgment and estimates are used in determining the collectability of accounts receivable and evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for expected credit losses. The Company considers specific accounts receivable and historical credit loss experience, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and the age of outstanding balances as part of its evaluation. When an account is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the reserve for expected credit losses. In response to the economic disruption created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impact on our customer base, the Company performed an additional evaluation of amounts due from customers in fiscal 2020 that were deemed to be higher collection risk. This evaluation resulted in a reserve for expected credit losses in excess of historical rates. The judgment applied to increase the reserve for expected credit losses beyond our historical policy was deemed to be reasonable and supportable based on the data available as of the consolidated balance sheet date.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe Companys financial instruments, which may expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk, include cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and foreign exchange forward contracts. Each of these financial instruments is recorded at cost, which approximates its fair value given the short maturity of each financial instrument.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn fiscal 2022, approximately 88.5% of the Companys revenues are derived from fees for route servicing of Core Laundry Operations, Specialty Garments and First Aid services performed by the Companys employees at the customers location of business. Revenues from the Companys route servicing customer contracts represent a single-performance obligation. The Company recognizes these revenues over time as services are performed based on the nature of services provided and contractual rates (input method). Certain of the Companys customer contracts, primarily within the Companys Core Laundry Operations, include pricing terms and conditions that include components of variable consideration. The variable consideration is typically in the form of consideration due to a customer based on performance metrics specified within the contract. Specifically, some contracts contain discounts or rebates that the customer can earn through the achievement of specified volume levels. Each component of variable consideration is earned based on the Companys actual performance during the measurement period specified within the contract. To determine the transaction price, the Company estimates the variable consideration using the most likely amount method, based on the specific contract provisions and known performance results during the relevant measurement period. When determining if variable consideration should be constrained, the Company considers whether factors outside its control could result in a significant reversal of revenue. In making these assessments, the Company considers the likelihood and magnitude of a potential reversal. The Companys performance period generally corresponds with the monthly invoice period. No significant constraints on the Companys revenue recognition were applied during fiscal 2022. The Company reassesses these estimates during each reporting period. The Company maintains a liability for these discounts and rebates within accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Variable consideration also includes consideration paid to a customer at the beginning of a contract. The Company capitalizes this consideration and amortizes it over the life of the contract as a reduction to revenue in accordance with the accounting guidance for revenue recognition. These assets are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table presents the Companys revenues for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 disaggregated by service type:\nYears ended\nAugust 27, 2022\nAugust 28, 2021\nAugust 29, 2020\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nRevenues\n% of\nRevenues\nRevenues\n% of\nRevenues\nRevenues\n% of\nRevenues\nCore Laundry Operations\n$\n1,770,502\n88.5\n%\n$\n1,615,560\n88.5\n%\n$\n1,601,485\n88.8\n%\nSpecialty Garments\n152,885\n7.6\n%\n145,454\n8.0\n%\n133,185\n7.4\n%\nFirst Aid\n77,435\n3.9\n%\n65,202\n3.5\n%\n69,489\n3.9\n%\nTotal Revenues\n$\n2,000,822\n100.0\n%\n$\n1,826,216\n100.0\n%\n$\n1,804,159\n100.0\n%\nDuring fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 the percentage of revenues recognized over time as the services are performed was 88.4%, 95.8% and 94.7% of Core Laundry Operations revenues, respectively, and 83.8%, 81.8% and 79.2% of Specialty Garments revenues, respectively. During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, 11.6%, 4.2% and 5.3% of Core Laundry Operations revenues, respectively, 16.2%, 18.2% and 20.8% of Specialty Garments revenues, respectively, and 100% of First Aid revenues were recognized at a point in time, which generally occurs when the goods are transferred to the customer.\nCosts to Obtain a Contract\nThe Company defers commission expenses paid to its employee-partners when the commissions are deemed to be incremental for obtaining the route servicing customer contract. The deferred commissions are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit. The Company reviews the deferred commission balances for impairment on an ongoing basis. Deferred commissions are classified as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the expense. The current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the non-current portion is included in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. As of August 27, 2022, the current and non-current assets related to deferred commissions totaled $15.2 million and $65.1 million, respectively. As of August 28, 2021, the current and non-current assets related to deferred commissions totaled $14.2 million and $60.6 million, respectively. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we recorded $15.4 million and $14.4 million, respectively, of amortization expense related to deferred commissions. This amortization expense is classified in selling and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of income.\nInventories and Rental Merchandise in Service\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, net of any reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. Work-in-process and finished goods inventories consist of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. Judgments and estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to customers or used in rental operations. Historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both excess and obsolete inventories. If actual product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. The Company uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method to value its inventories.\nThe components of inventory as of August 27, 2022 and August 28, 2021 were as follows (in thousands):\nAugust 27,\nAugust 28,\nRaw materials\n$\n25,932\n$\n24,846\nWork in process\n2,876\n4,703\nFinished goods\n122,651\n114,042\nTotal inventory\n$\n151,459\n$\n143,591\nRental merchandise in service is amortized, primarily on a straight-line basis, over the estimated service lives of the merchandise, which range from six to thirty-six months. The amortization expense is included in the cost of revenues on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. In establishing estimated lives for merchandise in service, management considers historical experience and the intended use of the merchandise. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of operating profit for any period if management makes significant changes to these estimates.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, while expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized.\nThe components of property, plant and equipment as of August 27, 2022 and August 28, 2021 were as follows (in thousands):\nAugust 27,\nAugust 28,\nLand, buildings and leasehold equipment\n$\n663,089\n$\n618,910\nMachinery and equipment\n622,168\n595,081\nMotor vehicles\n308,242\n285,543\n1,593,499\n1,499,534\nLess: accumulated depreciation\n928,380\n881,815\nTotal property, plant and equipment\n$\n665,119\n$\n617,719\nThe Company provides for depreciation on the straight-line method based on the date the asset is placed in service using the following estimated useful lives:\nBuildings (in years)\n30 - 40\nBuilding components (in years)\n10 - 20\nLeasehold improvements\nShorter of useful\nlife or term of lease\nMachinery and equipment (in years)\n3 - 10\nMotor vehicles (in years)\n3 - 5\nLong-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired. There were no material impairments of long-lived assets in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company does not amortize goodwill. Instead, the Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis. Management completed its annual goodwill impairment test on the last day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year prior to fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2020, the Company changed its annual goodwill impairment test date to the first day of the fourth quarter to better align with its internal business processes. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that companies test goodwill if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned below its carrying amount. The Company used the qualitative assessment option for its impairment testing for goodwill in fiscal 2022 and determined that the fair values of the reporting units more likely than not exceeded their carrying values and that there was no evidence of impairment as of May 29, 2022.\nThe Company cannot predict future economic conditions and their impact on the Company or the future net realizable value of the Companys stock. A decline in the Companys market capitalization and/or deterioration in general economic conditions could negatively and materially impact the Companys assumptions and assessment of the fair value of the Companys business. If general economic conditions or the Companys financial performance deteriorate, the Company may be required to record a goodwill impairment charge in the future which could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which are based on managements estimates of the period that the assets will generate economic benefits. Definite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no impairments of goodwill or indicators of impairment for definite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2022, 2021 or 2020.\nAs of August 27, 2022, definite-lived intangible assets have a weighted average useful life of approximately 13.5 years. Customer contracts have a weighted average useful life of approximately 13.8 years and other intangible assets, net, which consist of primarily, restrictive covenants, software and trademarks, have a weighted average useful life of approximately 6.1 years.\nEnvironmental and Other Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of its business operations, including environmental matters, personal injury, customer contract matters and employment claims. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. The Company regularly consults with attorneys and outside consultants in its consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances before recording a contingent liability. The Company records accruals for environmental and other contingencies based on enacted laws, regulatory orders or decrees, the Companys estimates of costs, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, the timing of payments, and the input of outside consultants and attorneys.\nThe estimated liability for environmental contingencies has been discounted as of August 27, 2022 using risk-free interest rates ranging from 3.0% to 3.4% over periods ranging from ten to thirty years. The estimated current costs, net of legal settlements with insurance carriers, have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at 3% per year. Changes in enacted laws, regulatory orders or decrees, managements estimates of costs, risk-free interest rates, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, the timing of payments, the input of the Companys attorneys and outside consultants or other factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for environmental and other contingent liabilities. Refer to Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, of these Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion and analysis.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nUnder U.S. GAAP, asset retirement obligations generally apply to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or the normal operation of a long-lived asset. The Company recognizes asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset.\nThe Company has recognized as a liability the present value of the estimated future costs to decommission its nuclear laundry facilities. The Company depreciates, on a straight-line basis, the amount added to property, plant and equipment and recognizes accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the various remaining lives which range from approximately one to twenty-two years.\nThe estimated liability has been based on historical experience in decommissioning nuclear laundry facilities, estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, external vendor estimates as to the cost to decommission these assets in the future, and federal and state regulatory requirements. The estimated current costs have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at 3% per year. The liability has been discounted using credit-adjusted risk-free rates that range from approximately 7.00% to 7.50%. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in the Companys estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, estimated dates of decommissioning, changes in decommissioning costs, changes in federal or state regulatory guidance on the decommissioning of such facilities, or other changes in estimates. Changes due to revised estimates are recognized by adjusting the carrying amount of the liability and the related long-lived asset if the assets are still in service, or charged to expense in the period if the assets are no longer in service.\nInsurance\nThe Company is self-insured for certain obligations related to health, workers compensation, vehicles and general liability programs. The Company also purchases stop-loss insurance policies for health, workers compensation, vehicles and general liability programs to protect itself from catastrophic losses. Judgments and estimates are used in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for events that have occurred, but have not been reported. The Companys estimates consider historical claims experience and other factors. In certain cases where partial insurance coverage exists, the Company estimates the portion of the liability that will be covered by existing insurance policies to arrive at its net expected liability. Receivables for insurance recoveries are recorded as assets, on an undiscounted basis. The Companys liabilities are based on estimates, and, while the Company believes that its accruals are adequate, the ultimate liability may be significantly different from the amounts recorded. Changes in claims experience, the Companys ability to settle claims or other estimates and judgments used by management could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any period.\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plan and other Pension Plans\nPension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees estimated service periods. Pension expense is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements.\nThe Company (1) recognizes in its statement of financial position the over-funded or under-funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation, (2) recognizes as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax, the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost, (3) measures defined benefit plan assets and defined benefit plan obligations as of the date of its statement of financial position, and (4) discloses additional information in the notes to financial statements about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost in the upcoming fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits. Refer to Note 7, Employee Benefit Plans, of these Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Companys pension plans.\nThe calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of critical assumptions, including the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, the assumed discount rates, assumed rate of compensation increases and life expectancy of participants. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in the Companys pension plans will impact the Companys future pension expense and liabilities. The Company cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future.\nNonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan\nThe Company adopted the UniFirst Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan (the NQDC Plan) effective on February 1, 2022. The NQDC Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan that allows eligible participants to voluntarily defer receipt of their salary and annual cash bonuses up to approved limits. In its discretion, the Company may credit one or more additional contributions to participant accounts. NQDC Plan participants who are not accruing benefits under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan are eligible to have discretionary annual employer contributions credited to their NQDC Plan accounts. All participants are also eligible to have employer supplemental contributions and employer discretionary contributions credited to their NQDC Plan accounts. The amounts of such contributions may differ from year to year and from participant to participant. Refer to Note 7, Employee Benefit Plans, of these Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Companys NQDC Plan.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company computes income tax expense by jurisdiction based on its operations in each jurisdiction. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the amounts recognized for income tax and financial reporting purposes at currently enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. See Note 4, Income Taxes in these Consolidated Financial Statements for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes. The Company regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets will be realized.\nThe Company is periodically reviewed by U.S. domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews typically include inquiries regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, the Company records estimated reserves. Refer to Note 4, Income Taxes, of these Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Companys accounting for income taxes and its uncertain tax positions for financial accounting purposes.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and are classified as selling and administrative expenses. The Company incurred advertising costs of $14.7 million, $3.5 million and $3.8 million, for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nShare-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense for all stock options, stock appreciation rights, unrestricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, Share-Based Awards) is recognized ratably over the related vesting period, net of actual forfeitures. Certain Share-Based Awards in the form of stock appreciation rights and shares of unrestricted stock were granted during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 to non-employee Directors of the Company, which were fully vested upon grant and, with respect to stock appreciation rights, expire eight years after the grant date. Accordingly, compensation expense related to these Share-Based Awards in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was recognized on the date of grant.\nFor performance-based restricted stock unit awards with revenue and earnings per share performance criteria, we evaluate the probability of meeting the performance criteria at each balance sheet date and, if probable, related compensation cost is amortized over the performance period on a straight-line basis because such awards vest only at the end of the measurement period. Changes to the probability assessment and the estimate of shares expected to vest will result in adjustments to the related share-based compensation expense that will be recorded in the period of the change. If the performance targets are not achieved, no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed.\nU.S. GAAP requires that share-based compensation cost be measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and be recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Determining the fair value of Share-Based Awards in the form of stock appreciation rights at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends and share price volatility. The fair value of each Share-Based Award in the form of stock appreciation rights is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants over the related vesting period. The fair value for each restricted stock, unrestricted stock and restricted stock unit grant is determined by using the closing price of the Companys stock on the date of the grant. Refer to Note 12, Share-Based Compensation, of these Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Companys share-based compensation plans.\nIncome Per Share\nThe Company calculates income per share by allocating income to its unvested participating securities as part of its income per share calculations.\nThe Class B Common Stock may be converted at any time on a one-for-one basis into Common Stock at the option of the holder of the Class B Common Stock. Diluted income per share for the Companys Common Stock assumes the conversion of all of the Companys Class B Common Stock into Common Stock, full vesting of outstanding restricted stock, and the exercise of Share-Based Awards under the Companys stock incentive plans.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic income per share using the two-class method for amounts attributable to the Companys shares of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (in thousands, except per share data):\nYear ended\nAugust 27,\nAugust 28,\nAugust 29,\nNet income available to shareholders\n$\n103,404\n$\n151,111\n$\n135,770\nAllocation of net income for Basic:\nCommon Stock\n$\n86,844\n$\n126,848\n$\n114,017\nClass B Common Stock\n16,560\n24,263\n21,753\n$\n103,404\n$\n151,111\n$\n135,770\nWeighted average number of shares for Basic:\nCommon Stock\n15,203\n15,237\n15,276\nClass B Common Stock\n3,621\n3,643\n3,643\n18,824\n18,880\n18,919\nIncome per share for Basic:\nCommon Stock\n$\n5.71\n$\n8.32\n$\n7.46\nClass B Common Stock\n$\n4.57\n$\n6.66\n$\n5.97\nThe Company is required to calculate the diluted income per share for Common Stock using the more dilutive of the following two methods:\nThe treasury stock method; or\nThe two-class method assuming a participating security is not exercised or converted.\nFor fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Companys diluted income per share assumes the conversion of all Class B Common Stock into Common Stock and uses the two-class method for its unvested participating shares. The following table sets forth the computation of diluted income per share of Common Stock for the years ended August 27, 2022, August 28, 2021 and August 29, 2020 (in thousands, except per share data):\nYear Ended August 27, 2022\nYear Ended August 28, 2021\nYear Ended August 29, 2020\nEarnings\nto Common\nshareholders\nCommon\nShares\nIncome\nPer Share\nEarnings\nto Common\nshareholders\nCommon\nShares\nIncome\nPer Share\nEarnings\nto Common\nshareholders\nCommon\nShares\nIncome\nPer Share\nAs reported-Basic\n$\n86,844\n15,203\n$\n5.71\n$\n126,848\n15,237\n$\n8.32\n$\n114,017\n15,276\n$\n7.46\nAdd: effect of dilutive potential\ncommon shares\nShare-Based Awards\n-\n-\n-\nClass B Common Stock\n16,560\n3,621\n24,263\n3,643\n21,753\n3,643\nDiluted Income Per Share-\nCommon Stock\n$\n103,404\n18,933\n$\n5.46\n$\n151,111\n19,038\n$\n7.94\n$\n135,770\n19,042\n$\n7.13\nShare-Based Awards that would result in the issuance of 34,416, 6,005 and 8,094 shares, respectively, of Common Stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 because they were anti-dilutive.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of our foreign operations is the local countrys currency. Transaction gains and losses, including gains and losses on our intercompany transactions, are included in other expense, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during each month of the fiscal year. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued updated guidance to modify the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. This guidance was effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2020, and was required to be applied on a retrospective basis with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard was effective for the Company on August 29, 2021. The Companys adoption of this guidance on August 29, 2021 did not have a material impact on its financial statements or related disclosures.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued updated guidance to simplify accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions and improving the consistent application of and simplifying U.S. GAAP in other areas of this topic. This guidance was effective for annual reporting periods, and any interim periods within those annual periods, that began after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Companys adoption of this guidance on August 29, 2021 did not have a material impact on its financial statements.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued updated guidance to improve the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods, and any interim periods within those annual periods, that begin after December 15, 2023 and will be required to be applied on a prospective basis with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard will be effective for the Company on September 1, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued updated guidance to increase the transparency of government assistance, including the disclosure of the types of assistance, an entitys accounting for the assistance and the effect of the assistance on an entitys financial statements. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods that begin after December 15, 2021 and will be required to be applied on a prospective basis with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard will be effective for the Company on August 28, 2022. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its financial statements.\n2. Acquisitions\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company completed thirteen business acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $44.8 million. The allocations of the purchase prices with respect to certain assets acquired during fiscal 2022 are complete.\nThe results of operations of these acquisitions have been included in the Companys consolidated financial results since their respective acquisition dates. These acquisitions were not significant in relation to the Companys consolidated financial results and, therefore, pro forma financial information has not been presented.\nIn September 2019, the Company completed an acquisition for approximately $38.8 million. The all-cash transaction was structured as an asset acquisition, with the Company acquiring substantially all of the acquired companys industrial laundry, industrial uniform rental and industrial direct sales assets.\nAggregate information relating to the acquisition of businesses which were accounted for as purchases is as follows (in thousands, except number of businesses acquired):\nYear ended\nAugust 27,\nAugust 28,\nAugust 29,\nNumber of businesses acquired\nTangible assets acquired\n$\n5,542\n$\n$\n6,370\nGoodwill\n27,964\n4,533\n23,544\nCustomer contracts\n10,450\n3,219\n12,697\nOther intangible assets\nLiabilities assumed\n-\n-\n(1,872\n)\nAcquisition of businesses\n$\n44,763\n$\n8,743\n$\n41,333\nTangible assets acquired primarily relate to accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses and property, plant and equipment. Liabilities assumed primarily relate to leases, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nThe amount assigned to intangible assets acquired was based on their respective fair values determined as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the tangible and intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, the goodwill was primarily allocated to the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning segment and is deductible for tax purposes.\n3. Fair Value Measurements\nU.S. GAAP establishes a framework for measuring fair value and establishes disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We considered non-performance risk when determining fair value of our derivative financial instruments.\nThe fair value hierarchy prescribed under U.S. GAAP contains three levels as follows:\nLevel 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.\nAll financial assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) have been segregated into the most appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to determine the fair value at the measurement date. The assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized in the tables below (in thousands):\nAs of August 27, 2022\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nFair Value\nAssets:\nCash equivalents\n$\n197,121\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n197,121\nPension plan assets\n-\n3,291\n-\n3,291\nNon-qualified deferred compensation plan assets\n-\n1,263\n-\n1,263\nForeign currency forward contracts\n-\n-\nTotal assets at fair value\n$\n197,121\n$\n4,637\n$\n-\n$\n201,758\nAs of August 28, 2021\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nFair Value\nAssets:\nCash equivalents\n$\n197,081\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n197,081\nPension plan assets\n-\n3,795\n-\n3,795\nForeign currency forward contracts\n-\n-\nTotal assets at fair value\n$\n197,081\n$\n3,836\n$\n-\n$\n200,917\nThe Companys cash equivalents listed above represent money market securities and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. The Company does not adjust the quoted market price for such financial instruments.\nThe Companys pension plan assets listed above represent guaranteed deposit accounts that are maintained and operated by Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company (PRIAC). All assets are merged with the general assets of PRIAC and are invested predominantly in privately placed securities and mortgages. At the beginning of each calendar year, PRIAC notifies the Company of the annual rates of interest which will be applied to the amounts held in the guaranteed deposit account during the next calendar year. In determining the interest rate to be applied, PRIAC considers the investment performance of the underlying assets of the prior year; however, regardless of the investment performance the Company is contractually guaranteed a minimum rate of return. As such, the Companys pension plan assets are included within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe Companys foreign currency forward contracts represent contracts the Company has entered into to exchange Canadian dollars for U.S. dollars at fixed exchange rates in order to manage its exposure related to certain forecasted Canadian dollar denominated sales of one of its subsidiaries. These contracts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other long-term assets as of August 27, 2022 and August 28, 2021. The fair value of the forward contracts is based on similar exchange traded derivatives and are, therefore, included within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n4. Income Taxes\nThe provision / (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):\nFiscal year\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$\n7,655\n$\n35,267\n$\n40,084\nForeign\n1,839\n1,714\n1,589\nState\n3,701\n9,873\n12,865\nTotal current\n$\n13,195\n$\n46,854\n$\n54,538\nDeferred:\nFederal\n$\n13,883\n$\n(1,421\n)\n$\n(8,522\n)\nForeign\n(599\n)\nState\n3,663\n(521\n)\n(3,299\n)\nTotal deferred\n$\n17,726\n$\n(1,094\n)\n$\n(12,420\n)\nTotal\n$\n30,921\n$\n45,760\n$\n42,118\nThe following table reconciles the provision for income taxes using the statutory federal income tax rate to the actual provision for income taxes:\nFiscal year\nIncome taxes at the statutory federal income tax rate\n21.0\n%\n21.0\n%\n21.0\n%\nState income taxes\n4.7\n4.2\n4.4\nAdjustments to Tax Reserve\n(2.1\n)\n(0.3\n)\n(0.9\n)\nOther\n(0.6\n)\n(1.7\n)\n(0.8\n)\nTotal\n23.0\n%\n23.2\n%\n23.7\n%\nThe components of deferred income taxes included on the consolidated balance sheets are as follows (in thousands):\nAugust 27,\nAugust 28,\nDeferred Tax Assets\nPayroll and benefit related\n$\n14,923\n$\n21,893\nInsurance related\n15,035\n14,042\nEnvironmental\n8,212\n8,408\nAccrued expenses\n8,170\n10,134\nOperating lease liabilities\n11,471\n9,214\nOther\n9,841\n8,127\nTotal deferred tax assets\n$\n67,652\n$\n71,818\nDeferred Tax Liabilities\nPayroll and benefit related\n$\n20,588\n$\n19,474\nTax in excess of book depreciation\n40,016\n40,725\nPurchased intangible assets\n39,747\n36,183\nRental merchandise in service\n55,287\n45,432\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n11,111\n8,984\nOther\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n166,981\n150,955\nNet deferred tax liability\n$\n99,329\n$\n79,137\nThe Company regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets will be realized.\nEffective tax rate\nThe Companys effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended August 27, 2022 was 23.0% as compared to 23.2% for the corresponding period in the prior year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the tax benefit related to the release of existing tax reserves in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021.\nForeign tax effect\nAs of August 27, 2022, unremitted foreign earnings, have been retained by the Companys foreign subsidiaries for indefinite reinvestment. If the Company were to repatriate those earnings, in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company could be subject to immaterial withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries.\nUncertain tax positions\nAs of August 27, 2022 and August 28, 2021, there was $6.4 million and $9.3 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $5.7 million and $8.7 million, respectively, would favorably impact the Companys effective tax rate, if recognized. The Company recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense which is consistent with the recognition of these items in prior reporting periods. As of August 27, 2022 and August 28, 2021, the Company had accrued a total of a nominal amount and $0.1 million, respectively, in interest and penalties, in its long-term accrued liabilities. For the years ended August 27, 2022, August 28, 2021 and August 29, 2020 the Company recognized a nominal expense in its Consolidated Statement of Income related to interest and penalties.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\nBalance at August 29, 2020\n$\n6,330\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years\n3,552\nReduction for tax positions of prior years\n(287\n)\nStatute expirations\n(911\n)\nBalance at August 28, 2021\n9,321\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years\nReduction for tax positions of prior years\n(3,013\n)\nStatute expirations\n(487\n)\nBalance at August 27, 2022\n$\n6,417\nThe Company has a significant portion of its operations in the United States and Canada. It is required to file federal income tax returns as well as state income tax returns in a majority of the U.S. states and also in a number of Canadian provinces. At times, the Company is subject to audits in these jurisdictions, which typically are complex and can require several years to resolve. The final resolution of any such tax audits could result in either a reduction in the Companys accruals or an increase in its income tax provision, both of which could have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations in any given period.\nAll U.S. and Canadian federal income tax statutes have lapsed for filings up to and including fiscal years 2017 and 2014, respectively. With a few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations for periods prior to fiscal 2018. The Company is not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly in the next 12 months.\n5. Loans Payable and Long-term Debt\nAs of August 27, 2022 and August 28, 2021, the Company had no outstanding loans payable.\nOn March 26, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated $175.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement (the 2021 Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, which matures on March 26, 2026. The 2021 Credit Agreement amended and restated the $250.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement, which was scheduled to mature on April 11, 2021. Under the 2021 Credit Agreement, the Company may borrow funds at variable interest rates based on, at the Companys election, the Eurodollar rate or a base rate, plus in each case a spread based on the Companys consolidated funded debt ratio. Availability of credit requires compliance with certain financial and other covenants, including a maximum consolidated funded debt ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio, each as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement. The Company tests its compliance with these financial covenants on a fiscal quarterly basis. As of August 27, 2022, the interest rates applicable to the Companys borrowings under the 2021 Credit Agreement would be calculated as LIBOR plus 1.00% at the time of the respective borrowing. As of August 27, 2022, the Company had no outstanding borrowings and had outstanding letters of credit amounting to $60.8 million, leaving $114.2 million available for borrowing under the 2021 Credit Agreement.\nAs of August 27, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the 2021 Credit Agreement.\n6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies on certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. U.S. GAAP requires that all of the Companys derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. All subsequent changes in a derivatives fair value are recognized in income, unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.\nDerivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are classified as a hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset, liability or forecasted transaction. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income until the hedged item or forecasted transaction is recognized in earnings. The Company performs an assessment at the inception of the hedge and on a quarterly basis thereafter, to determine whether its derivatives are highly effective in\noffsetting changes in the value of the hedged items. Any changes in the fair value resulting from hedge ineffectiveness are immediately recognized as income or expense.\nIn June 2018, the Company entered into twelve forward contracts to exchange CAD for U.S. dollars at fixed exchange rates in order to manage its exposure related to certain forecasted CAD denominated sales of one of its subsidiaries. The hedged transactions are specified as the first amount of CAD denominated revenues invoiced by one of the Companys domestic subsidiaries each fiscal quarter, beginning in the third fiscal quarter of 2019 and continuing through the second fiscal quarter of 2022. In total, the Company sold approximately 12.1 million CAD at an average Canadian-dollar exchange rate of 0.7814 over these quarterly periods. The Company concluded that the forward contracts met the criteria to qualify as a cash flow hedge under U.S. GAAP. These forward contracts matured on February 25, 2022.\nIn August 2021, the Company entered into twenty forward contracts to exchange CAD for U.S. dollars at fixed exchange rates in order to manage its exposure related to certain forecasted CAD denominated sales of one of its subsidiaries. The hedged transactions are specified as the first amount of CAD denominated revenues invoiced by one of the Companys domestic subsidiaries each fiscal quarter, beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2022 and continuing through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2026. In total, the Company will sell approximately 14.1 million CAD at an average Canadian-dollar exchange rate of 0.7861 over these quarterly periods. The Company concluded that the forward contracts met the criteria to qualify as a cash flow hedge under U.S. GAAP.\nAs of August 27, 2022, the Company had forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 7.2 million CAD outstanding and recorded the fair value of the contracts of $0.1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets with a corresponding loss of $0.1 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which was recorded net of tax. For the fiscal year ended August 27, 2022, the Company reclassified $0.1 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to revenue, related to the derivative financial instruments. The loss on these forward contracts that results in an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss as of August 27, 2022 is expected to be reclassified to revenues prior to their maturity on August 29, 2026.\n7. Employee Benefit Plans\nDefined Contribution Retirement Savings Plan\nThe Company has a defined contribution retirement savings plan with a 401(k) feature for all eligible U.S. and Canadian employees not under collective bargaining agreements. The Company matches a portion of the employees contribution and may make an additional contribution at its discretion. Contributions charged to expense under the plan for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $18.2 million, $19.9 million and $16.6 million, respectively.\nPension Plans and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans\nThe Company accounts for its pension plans and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan on an accrual basis over employees estimated service periods.\nThe Company maintains an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for certain eligible employees of the Company. The benefits are based on the employees compensation upon retirement. The amount charged to expense related to this plan amounted to approximately $1.5 million, $2.9 million and $2.6 million for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company maintains a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (UniFirst Plan) covering employees at one of its locations. The benefits are based on years of service. The UniFirst Plan assets are invested in a Guaranteed Deposit Account (GDA) that is maintained and operated by Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company (PRIAC). All assets are merged with the general assets of PRIAC and are invested predominantly in privately placed securities and mortgages. At the beginning of each calendar year, PRIAC notifies the Company of the annual rates of interest which will be applied to the amounts held in the GDA during the next calendar year. In determining the interest rate to be applied, PRIAC considers the investment performance of the underlying assets of the prior year; however, regardless of the investment performance the annual interest rate applied per the contract must be a minimum of 3.25%. The amount charged to expense related to this plan amounted to approximately $0.1 million for fiscal 2022 and $0.2 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nIn connection with one of the Companys acquisitions, the Company assumed liabilities related to a frozen pension plan covering many of the acquired Companys former employees (Textilease Plan). The Textilease Plan was terminated in fiscal 2020. The pension benefits were based on years of service and the employees compensation. The Textilease Plan assets were held in a separate GDA with PRIAC; however the minimum interest rate per the Textilease Plan contract was 1.5%. The amount charged to expense related to this plan amounted to approximately $0.5 million for fiscal 2020. There was no expense incurred related to this plan in either fiscal 2022 or 2021.\nThe Company refers to its UniFirst Plan and Textilease Plan collectively as its Pension Plans.\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost related to the Companys Pension Plans and SERP for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\nPension Plans\nSERP\nService cost\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n1,100\n$\nInterest cost\n1,027\nExpected return on assets\n(118\n)\n(131\n)\n(138\n)\n-\n-\n-\nAmortization of prior service cost\n-\n-\n-\nAmortization of net loss\nOther events\n(10\n)\n-\n(855\n)\n-\n-\nNet periodic benefit cost\n$\n$\n$\n$\n1,508\n$\n2,864\n$\n2,648\nThe Companys obligations and funded status related to its Pension Plans and SERP as of August 27, 2022 and August 28, 2021 were as follows (in thousands):\nPension Plans\nSERP\nChange in benefit obligation:\nProjected benefit obligation, beginning of year\n$\n5,035\n$\n5,468\n$\n36,644\n$\n38,616\nService cost\n1,100\nInterest cost\nActuarial (gain) loss\n(861\n)\n(225\n)\n(8,871\n)\n(2,890\n)\nBenefits paid\n(23\n)\n(28\n)\n(1,203\n)\n(1,125\n)\nSettlements/Curtailments\n(490\n)\n(355\n)\n(855\n)\n-\nProjected benefit obligation, end of year\n$\n3,837\n$\n5,035\n$\n27,562\n$\n36,644\nChange in plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets, beginning of year\n$\n3,796\n$\n4,146\n$\n-\n$\n-\nActual return on plan assets\n-\n-\nEmployer contributions\n-\n-\n-\n-\nBenefits paid\n(23\n)\n(28\n)\n-\n-\nSettlements/Curtailments\n(490\n)\n(355\n)\n-\n-\nFair value of plan assets, end of year\n$\n3,300\n$\n3,796\n$\n-\n$\n-\nFunded status (net amount recognized):\n$\n(537\n)\n$\n(1,239\n)\n$\n(27,562\n)\n$\n(36,644\n)\nAs of August 27, 2022 and August 28, 2021, the accumulated benefit obligations for the Companys Pension Plans were $3.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively.

The NQDC Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan that allows eligible participants to voluntarily defer receipt of their salary and annual cash bonuses up to approved limits. In its discretion, the Company may credit one or more additional contributions to participant accounts. NQDC Plan participants who are not accruing benefits under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan are eligible to have discretionary annual employer contributions credited to their NQDC Plan accounts. All participants are also eligible to have employer supplemental contributions and employer discretionary contributions credited to their NQDC Plan accounts. The amounts of such contributions may differ from year to\nyear and from participant to participant. During the fiscal year ended August 27, 2022, the NQDC Plan had aggregate contributions of $1.3 million credited to participant accounts. The amount charged to expense was nominal for the year ended August 27, 2022. The Company, at its discretion, may also elect to transfer funds to a trust account with the intention to fund the future liability. Total NQDC Plan assets were $1.3 million as of August 27, 2022 and are included within other long-term assets on the balance sheet.\n8. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nAs discussed in Note 2, Acquisitions, when the Company acquires a business the amount assigned to the tangible assets and liabilities and intangible assets acquired is based on their respective fair values determined as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the tangible assets and liabilities and intangible assets is recorded as goodwill. The following details the changes in the Companys intangible assets and goodwill related to the Companys acquisitions for the years ended August 27, 2022 and August 28, 2021 as well as the respective periods over which the assets will be amortized (in thousands, except weighted average life in years). These amounts include additional payments associated with prior year acquisitions:\nYear ended\nAugust 27,\nWeighted\nAverage Life\nin Years\nAugust 28,\nWeighted\nAverage Life\nin Years\nGoodwill\n$\n27,964\nN/A\n$\n4,533\nN/A\nCustomer contracts\n10,450\n13.8\n3,219\n10.0\nOther intangible assets\n6.1\n5.0\nTotal intangible assets and goodwill acquired\n$\n39,221\n$\n7,931\nThe Company does not amortize goodwill, but it is reviewed annually or more frequently if certain indicators arise, for impairment.

Asset Retirement Obligations\nAsset retirement obligations generally result from legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or the normal operation of a long-lived asset. Accordingly, the Company recognizes asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. The Company continues to depreciate, on a straight-line basis, the amount added to property, plant and equipment and recognizes accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the various remaining lives which range from approximately one to twenty-two years.\nThe Company recognized as a liability the present value of the estimated future costs to decommission its nuclear laundry facilities. The estimated liability is based on historical experience in decommissioning nuclear laundry facilities, estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, external vendor estimates as to the cost to decommission these assets in the future, and federal and state regulatory requirements. The estimated current costs have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at 3% per year. The liability has been discounted using credit-adjusted risk-free rates that range from approximately 7.00% to 7.50% over approximately one to twenty-two years. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in the Companys estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, estimated dates of decommissioning, changes in decommissioning costs, changes in federal or state regulatory guidance on the decommissioning of such facilities, or other changes in estimates. Changes due to revised estimates are recognized by adjusting the carrying amount of the liability and the related long-lived asset if the assets are still in service, or charged to expense in the period if the assets are no longer in service.\nA rollforward of the Companys asset retirement liability is as follows for fiscal 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nAugust 27,\nAugust 28,\nBeginning balance\n$\n14,887\n$\n13,920\nAccretion expense\nEffect of exchange rate changes\n(583\n)\n(18\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n15,274\n$\n14,887\nThe Companys asset retirement obligations are included in current accrued liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n11. Commitments and Contingencies\nLease Commitments\nThe Company has operating leases for certain operating facilities, vehicles and equipment, which provide the right to use the underlying asset and require lease payments over the term of the lease. Each new contract is evaluated to determine if an arrangement contains a lease and whether that lease meets the classification criteria of a finance or operating lease. All identified leases are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding operating lease right-of-use asset, net, representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and the operating lease liabilities representing the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Short-term operating leases, which have an initial term of twelve months or less, are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term and include options to extend or terminate the lease when they are reasonably certain to be exercised. The present value of lease payments is determined primarily using the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available as of the lease commencement date. Lease expense for operating leases is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease costs are recorded as incurred. Both lease expense and variable lease costs are primarily recorded in cost of revenues on the Company's consolidated statements of income. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nThe following table presents the operating lease cost and information related to the operating lease right-of-use assets, net and operating lease liabilities for fiscal 2022:\n(In thousands, except lease term and discount rate)\nLease cost\nOperating lease costs including short-term lease expense and variable lease costs, which were immaterial in the period\n$\n21,904\nOperating cash flow impacts\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities\n$\n3,380\nOperating lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities\n$\n21,391\nWeighted-average remaining lease term - operating leases\n4.35\nWeighted-average discount rate - operating leases\n2.02\n%\nTotal rent expense on all leases was $18.3 million, $16.2 million and $15.2 million for the fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

In particular, industrial laundries currently use and must dispose of detergent waste water and other residues, and, in the past, used perchloroethylene and other dry-cleaning solvents. The Company is attentive to the environmental concerns surrounding the disposal of these materials and has, through the years, taken measures to avoid their improper disposal. The Company has settled, or contributed to the settlement of, past actions or claims brought against the Company relating to the disposal of hazardous materials at several sites and there can be no assurance that the Company will not have to expend material amounts to remediate the consequences of any such disposal in the future.\nU.S. GAAP requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. The Company regularly consults with attorneys and outside consultants in its consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances before recording a contingent liability. Changes in enacted laws, regulatory orders or decrees, managements estimates of costs, risk-free interest rates, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, the timing of payments, the input of the Companys attorneys and outside consultants or other factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for environmental and other contingent liabilities.\nUnder environmental laws, an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on, or in, or emanating from, such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee knew of, or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. There can be no assurances that acquired or leased locations have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon the Company under such laws or expose the Company to third-party actions such as tort suits. The Company continues to address environmental conditions under terms of consent orders negotiated with the applicable environmental authorities or otherwise with respect to certain sites.\nThe Company has accrued certain costs related to certain sites, including but not limited to, sites in Woburn and Somerville, Massachusetts, as it has been determined that the costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company, together with multiple other companies, are party to a consent decree related to the Company's property and the Central Area in Woburn, Massachusetts. The EPA has provided the Company and other signatories to the consent decree with comments on the design and implementation of groundwater and soil remedies at the Woburn site and investigation of environmental conditions in the Central Area. The consent decree does not address any remediation work that may be required in the Central Area. The Company, and other signatories, has implemented and proposed to do additional work at the Woburn site but many of the EPAs comments remain to be resolved. The Company has accrued costs to perform certain work responsive to the EPAs comments. Additionally, the Company has implemented mitigation measures and continue to monitor environmental conditions at a site in Somerville, Massachusetts. The Company has agreed to undertake additional actions responsive to a notice of audit findings from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection concerning a regulatory submittal that the Company made in 2009 for a portion of the site. The Company has received demands from the local transit authority for reimbursement of certain costs associated with its construction of a new municipal transit station in the area of the Somerville site. This station is part of an ongoing extension of the transit system. The Company has reserved for costs in\nconnection with this matter; however, in light of the uncertainties associated with this matter, these costs and the related reserve may change.\nThe Company routinely reviews and evaluates sites that may require remediation and monitoring and determines its estimated costs based on various estimates and assumptions. These estimates are developed using its internal sources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on:\nManagements judgment and experience in remediating and monitoring the Companys sites;\nInformation available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation and monitoring;\nThe number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) who may be liable for remediation and monitoring of a specific site; and\nThe typical allocation of costs among PRPs.\nThere is usually a range of reasonable estimates of the costs associated with each site. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Companys accruals reflect the amount within the range that it believes is the best estimate or the low end of a range of estimates if no point within the range is a better estimate. Where it believes that both the amount of a particular liability and the timing of the payments are reliably determinable, the Company adjusts the cost in current dollars using a rate of 3% for inflation until the time of expected payment and discounts the cost to present value using current risk-free interest rates. As of August 27, 2022, the risk-free interest rates utilized by the Company ranged from 3.0% to 3.4%.\nFor environmental liabilities that have been discounted, the Company includes interest accretion, based on the effective interest method, in selling and administrative expenses on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The changes to the Companys environmental liabilities for fiscal 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in thousands):\nYear ended\nAugust 27,\nAugust 28,\nBeginning balance\n$\n32,859\n$\n30,702\nCosts incurred for which reserves have been provided\n(2,188\n)\n(1,593\n)\nInsurance proceeds\nInterest accretion\nChanges in discount rates\n(3,235\n)\n(1,040\n)\nRevisions in estimates\n4,024\n4,213\nEnding balance\n$\n32,191\n$\n32,859\nAnticipated payments and insurance proceeds of currently identified environmental remediation liabilities as of August 27, 2022, for the next five fiscal years and thereafter, as measured in current dollars, are reflected below.\n(In thousands)\nThereafter\nTotal\nEstimated costs-current dollars\n$\n12,130\n$\n3,051\n$\n1,741\n$\n1,437\n$\n1,250\n$\n14,947\n$\n34,556\nEstimated insurance proceeds\n(173\n)\n(159\n)\n(173\n)\n(159\n)\n(173\n)\n(230\n)\n(1,067\n)\nNet anticipated costs\n$\n11,957\n$\n2,892\n$\n1,568\n$\n1,278\n$\n1,077\n$\n14,717\n$\n33,489\nEffect of inflation\n9,388\nEffect of discounting\n(10,686\n)\nBalance as of August 28, 2021\n$\n32,191\nEstimated insurance proceeds are primarily received from an annuity received as part of a legal settlement with an insurance company. Annual proceeds of approximately $0.3 million are deposited into an escrow account which funds remediation and monitoring costs for two sites related to former operations. Annual proceeds received but not expended in the current year accumulate in this account and may be used in future years for costs related to this site through the year 2027. As of August 27, 2022, the balance in this escrow account, which is held in a trust and is not recorded in the Companys accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet, was approximately $4.8 million. Also included in estimated insurance proceeds are amounts the Company is entitled to receive pursuant to legal settlements as reimbursements from three insurance companies for estimated costs at one of its sites.\nThe Companys nuclear garment decontamination facilities are licensed by respective state agencies, as delegated authority by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the NRC) pursuant to the NRCs Agreement State program and are subject to applicable federal and state radioactive material regulations. In addition, the Companys international locations (Canada, the\nUnited Kingdom and the European Union) are regulated by equivalent respective jurisdictional authorities. There can be no assurance that such regulation will not lead to material disruptions in the Companys garment decontamination business.\nFrom time to time, the Company is also subject to legal and regulatory proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of its business operations, including personal injury claims, customer contract matters, employment claims and environmental matters as described above.\nThe Company is subject to two actions filed by former employees in September 2022 alleging damages under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to such allegations and intends to defend itself vigorously in such matters. While the Company is unable to ascertain the ultimate outcome of such actions, based on the information currently available, the Company believes that a loss with respect to such matters is neither probable nor remote. Given the uncertainty associated with the ultimate resolution of such matters, the Company is unable to reasonably assess an estimate or range of estimates of any potential losses.\nIn addition, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Mexican federal tax authority issued a tax assessment on the Companys subsidiary in Mexico for fiscal 2016 import taxes, value added taxes and custom processing fees of over $17.0 million, plus surcharges, fines and penalties of over $67.7 million for a total assessment of over $84.7 million. The Company disagrees with such tax assessment and has filed an administrative appeal before the legal division of the Mexican federal tax authority challenging the validity of the tax assessment. While the Company is unable to ascertain the ultimate outcome of this matter, based on the information currently available, the Company believes that a loss with respect to this matter is neither probable nor remote. Given the uncertainty associated with the ultimate resolution of this matter, the Company is unable to reasonably assess an estimate or range of estimates of any potential losses.\nWhile it is impossible for the Company to ascertain the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to contingent liabilities, including lawsuits and environmental contingencies, the Company believes that the aggregate amount of such liabilities, if any, in excess of amounts covered by insurance have been properly accrued in accordance with U.S. GAAP. It is possible, however, that the future financial position and/or results of operations for any particular future period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions or strategies related to these contingencies or changes out of the Companys control.\nOther Contingent Liabilities\nAs security for certain agreements with the NRC and various state agencies related to the nuclear operations (see above) and certain insurance programs, the Company had standby irrevocable bank commercial letters of credit of $60.8 million and $67.5 million outstanding as of August 27, 2022 and August 28, 2021, respectively.\nNon-cancellable purchase commitments for inventories, software, and services amounted to $56.5 million as of August 27, 2022, of which $39.7 million will be paid in less than 1 year, $8.5 million will be paid in 1 to 3 years, and the remaining will be paid in 3 to 8 years.\n12. Share-based Compensation\nThe Company adopted a stock incentive plan (the 1996 Plan) in November 1996 and reserved 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance under the 1996 Plan. The 1996 Plan provided for the issuance of stock options and stock appreciation rights. The Company ceased granting new awards under the 1996 Plan as of January 21, 2011, and the 1996 Plan expired in accordance with its terms on January 8, 2012. The Company adopted a stock incentive plan (the 2010 Plan) in October 2010 and reserved 600,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance under the 2010 Plan. The 2010 Plan replaced the Companys 1996 Plan. The 2010 Plan permits the award of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, unrestricted stock and performance shares (collectively referred to as Share-Based Awards) as well as dividend equivalent rights and cash-based awards. On October 27, 2014, the Board of Directors, subject to the approval of the Companys shareholders, which was received at the 2015 annual meeting of shareholders, adopted an amendment to the 2010 Plan to, among other matters, reserve for issuance an additional 750,000 shares and extend to 2025 the time period awards may be granted under the 2010 Plan. As of August 27, 2022, the number of remaining shares available for future grants under the 2010 Plan was 173,581. Share-based compensation expense, which includes expense related to Share-Based Awards, has been recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income in selling and administrative expenses.\nAll Share-Based Awards issued to management were recommended to the Board of Directors by the Compensation Committee and approved by the Board of Directors. All Share-Based Awards issued to the Companys non-employee members of the Board of Directors (the Directors) under the 2010 Plan were recommended to the Board of Directors by the Compensation Committee and approved by the Board of Directors.\nIn fiscal 2022, a total of 1,025 shares of fully vested unrestricted stock were granted to certain non-employee Directors of the Company. No such shares were granted during each of fiscal 2021 and 2020. Accordingly, compensation expense related to the unrestricted stock granted in fiscal 2022 was recognized on the date of grant.\nIn fiscal 2022, the Company granted a total of 9,750 stock appreciation rights under the 2010 Plan to the Companys non-employee Directors. In both fiscal 2021 and 2020, the Company granted a total of 5,000 stock appreciation rights under the 2010 Plan to the Companys non-employee Directors. Such stock appreciation rights were fully vested upon grant, expire on the earlier of the eighth anniversary of the grant date or the second anniversary of the date that the Director ceases to be a member of the Board of Directors and must be settled in stock at the time of exercise. Accordingly, compensation expense related to the stock appreciation rights was recognized on the date of grant.\nAs of August 27, 2022, the total compensation cost not yet recognized related to non-vested Share-Based Awards was approximately $14.4 million. The weighted average period over which compensation cost for Share-Based Awards will be recognized is 1.5 years.\nAll stock appreciation rights issued to employees were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair net realizable value of the Companys Common Stock on the date of grant. Stock appreciation rights generally vest 20% on each anniversary of the grant date over a five-year period and expire ten years after the grant date. Share-Based Awards granted to the Companys non-employee Directors were fully vested as of the date of grant. Non-employee Director Share-Based Award grants in the form of stock appreciation rights expire on the earlier of the eighth anniversary of the grant date or the second anniversary of the date that the Director ceases to be a member of the Board of Directors.\nTime-based restricted stock units granted to employees vest 20% on each anniversary of the grant date over a five-year period. Generally, performance-based restricted stock units granted to employees are earned based on whether and the extent to which the Company achieves certain consolidated revenues and earnings per share.\nThe fair value of each stock appreciation right is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used:\nFiscal year ended August\nRisk-free interest rate\n1.27\n%\n0.47\n%\n1.69\n%\nExpected dividend yield\n0.60\n%\n0.58\n%\n0.50\n%\nExpected life in years\n5.17\n5.70\n5.60\nExpected volatility\n28.4\n%\n27.5\n%\n22.4\n%\nThe weighted average fair values of Share-Based Awards granted in the form of stock appreciation rights during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $51.25, $42.63 and $46.58, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the Share-Based Awards activity in the form of stock options and stock appreciation rights for fiscal 2022:\nNumber of\nShares\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise Price\nOutstanding, August 28, 2021\n394,174\n$\n144.07\nGranted\n34,754\n199.80\nExpired\n(168\n)\n201.24\nExercised\n(53,226\n)\n123.07\nForfeited\n(7,186\n)\n164.72\nOutstanding, August 27, 2022\n368,348\n$\n151.93\nExercisable, August 27, 2022\n250,223\n$\n141.68\nThe following table summarizes the Share-Based Awards activity in the form of restricted stock units for fiscal 2022:\nNumber of\nShares\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant Price\nUnvested balance at August 28, 2021\n94,558\n$\n178.78\nGranted\n41,875\n199.05\nVested\n(39,131\n)\n179.12\nForfeited\n(5,602\n)\n186.40\nUnvested balance at August 27, 2022\n91,700\n$\n187.43\n13. Shareholders Equity\nThe Company has two classes of common stock: Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote, is freely transferable, and is entitled to a cash dividend equal to 125% of any cash dividend paid on each share of Class B Common Stock. Each share of Class B Common Stock is entitled to ten votes and can be converted to Common Stock on a share-for-share basis. However, until converted to Common Stock, shares of Class B Common Stock are not freely transferable. During fiscal 2022, 17,000 shares of Class B Common Stock were converted to Common Stock. No such conversions occurred during each of fiscal 2021 and 2020.\nOn October 23, 2019, the Company announced that it would be raising its quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share for Common Stock and to $0.20 per share for Class B Common Stock, up from $0.1125 and $0.09 per share, respectively. The amount and timing of any future dividend payment is subject to the approval of the Board of Directors each quarter.\nOn October 20, 2021, the Company announced that it would be raising its quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share for Common Stock and to $0.24 per share for Class B Common Stock, up from $0.25 and $0.20 per share, respectively. The amount and timing of any future dividend is subject to the approval of the Board of Directors each quarter.\nOn January 2, 2019, the Companys Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase from time to time up to $100.0 million of its outstanding shares of Common Stock. Repurchases made under the program, if any, will be made in either the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including economic and market conditions, the Company stock price, corporate liquidity requirements and priorities, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The share repurchase program has been funded to date with available cash and may be funded in the future using the Companys available cash or capacity under its 2021 Credit Agreement and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. On October 18, 2021, the Companys Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase from time to time up to $100.0 million of its outstanding shares of Common Stock, inclusive of the amount which remained available under the existing share repurchase program approved on January 2, 2019. Repurchases made under the new program, if any, will continue to be made in either the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will depend on a variety of factors and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased 213,419 shares for an average price per share of $179.98. During fiscal 2021, the Company repurchased 60,950 shares for an average price per share of $184.13. During fiscal 2020, the Company repurchased 117,767 shares for an average price per share of $184.67. Currently, there is $63.6 million remaining to repurchase outstanding shares of Common Stock under this program. On July 15, 2022, the Company repurchased 35,714 shares of Class B Common Stock for $6.0 million from a related party at a per share price of $168.00\n14.

Segment Reporting\nOperating segments are identified as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Companys chief operating decision maker is the Companys chief executive officer. The Company has six operating segments based on the information reviewed by its chief executive officer: U.S. Rental and Cleaning, Canadian Rental and Cleaning, MFG, Specialty Garments, First Aid and Corporate. The U.S. Rental and Cleaning and Canadian Rental and Cleaning operating segments have been combined to form the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment, and as a result, the Company has five reporting segments.\nThe U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment purchases, rents, cleans, delivers and sells, uniforms and protective clothing and non-garment items in the United States and Canada. The laundry locations of the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment are referred to by the Company as industrial laundries or industrial laundry locations.\nThe MFG operating segment designs and manufactures uniforms and non-garment items primarily for the purpose of providing these goods to the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment. MFG revenues are primarily generated when goods are shipped from the Companys manufacturing facilities, or its subcontract manufacturers, to other Company locations. These intercompany revenues are recorded at a transfer price which is typically in excess of the actual manufacturing cost. Manufactured products are carried in inventory until placed in service at which time they are amortized at this transfer price. On a consolidated basis, intercompany revenues and income are eliminated and the carrying value of inventories and rental merchandise in service is reduced to the manufacturing cost. Income before income taxes from MFG net of the intercompany MFG elimination offsets the merchandise amortization costs incurred by the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment as the merchandise costs of this reporting segment are amortized and recognized based on inventories purchased from MFG at the transfer price which is above the Companys manufacturing cost.\nThe Corporate operating segment consists of costs associated with the Companys distribution center, sales and marketing, information systems, engineering, procurement, supply chain, accounting and finance, human resources, other general and administrative costs and interest expense. The revenues generated from the Corporate operating segment represent certain direct sales made by the Company directly from its distribution center. The products sold by this operating segment are the same products rented and sold by the U.S. and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment. In the table below, no assets or capital expenditures are presented for the Corporate operating segment because no assets are allocated to this operating segment in the information reviewed by the chief executive officer. However, depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets are reflected in income from operations and income before income taxes for the Corporate operating segment.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at August 27, 2022 and August 28, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 27, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 27, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated October 26, 2022 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nSelf-Insurance Accruals\nDescription of the Matter\nAs of August 27, 2022, the Company had recognized current and long-term insurance related liabilities of $32.4 million and $62.0 million, respectively. As discussed in Note 1 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, the Company is self-insured for certain obligations related to health, workers compensation, vehicles and general liability programs and judgments and estimates are used by the Company in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for events that have occurred but have not been reported.\nAuditing managements estimate of the portion of the insurance related liabilities related to workers compensation, vehicles and general liability is highly judgmental and complex due to the significant uncertainty in the potential value of reported claims and the number and potential value of incurred but not reported claims, the application of significant management judgment in making those estimates and the use of various actuarial methods. The reserve estimate is sensitive to actuarial assumptions used to estimate the ultimate liability for reported claims and to estimate the value of claims that have been incurred but have not been reported.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys self-insurance accrual process. This includes controls over the assumptions and methods used to establish the estimate. Specifically, we tested controls related to managements review of data provided to the actuary, significant actuarial assumptions and the related reconciliations.\nTo test the self-insurance accrual, we performed audit procedures over the significant inputs used in managements analysis, including performing transactional testing over the completeness and accuracy of claims data and vouching payments made to third parties. Furthermore, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in evaluating the key assumptions and methodologies used by management to determine the reserve. We then compared the Companys reserve amount to a range which our actuarial specialist developed based on independently selected assumptions.\nEnvironmental Contingencies\nDescription of the Matter\nAs discussed in Note 11 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other substances. As of August 27, 2022, the Company had recorded a current and long-term liability of $12.3 million and $19.9 million, respectively, representing its best estimate of losses related to these environmental matters.\nAuditing managements accounting for environmental loss contingencies was especially challenging, as significant judgment is required by the Company to evaluate whether it is probable that an environmental loss contingency has been incurred and to estimate the future costs to remediate the environmental matters. These judgments include managements identification of sites with potential liabilities, managements estimate of the amount and timing of remediation and other costs, allocation of costs among other potentially responsible parties, changes to enacted laws and regulation, discount rates, and evaluation of information available from regulatory agencies.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys identification and measurement of the environmental loss contingency. For example, we tested controls over managements review of the environmental loss contingency calculation and managements meetings where they evaluate key judgments and estimates affecting the environmental loss contingency, including those outlined in the paragraph above.\nTo test the assessment of the probability of incurrence of a loss and whether the loss was reasonably estimable, we inspected correspondence to and from regulatory agencies, obtained legal counsel confirmation letters, met with the Companys legal counsel and other members of management to discuss environmental matters, inspected environmental studies, read the minutes of the meetings of the Companys Board of Directors and committees of the Companys Board of Directors, and obtained a representation letter from the Company. Additionally, we utilized our environmental specialists to perform a search for unrecorded environmental liabilities related to the Companys sites to look for new or contrary evidence. To test the measurement of the environmental liabilities, we performed detailed testing over costs incurred, and based on these historical trends and input from management, we evaluated the reasonableness of estimated costs to be incurred. We tested the allocation of costs among potentially responsible parties by analyzing allocation settlement agreements, and tested other assumptions impacting the estimate such as inflation and discount rates by agreeing to third party sources. We also evaluated the accuracy of any changes in measurement of the liability through comparison with historical data.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2002.\nBoston, Massachusetts\nOctober 26, 2022 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, solely as a result of the material weakness identified by management and described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that material information relating to the Company required to be disclosed by the Company in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurances of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in designing and evaluating the controls and procedures. We continue to review our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nExcept for the material weakness identified by management and described below, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended August 27, 2022 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagements Responsibility for Financial Statements\nOur management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of our Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Those Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing those Consolidated Financial Statements, management was required to make certain estimates and judgments, which are based upon currently available information and managements view of current conditions and circumstances.\nThe Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, which consists solely of independent directors, oversees our process of reporting financial information and the audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The Audit Committee stays informed of our financial condition and regularly reviews managements financial policies and procedures, the independence of our independent auditors, our internal control over financial reporting and the objectivity of our financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm has full access to the Audit Committee and meets with the Audit Committee periodically, both with and without management present.\nWe have retained Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit our Consolidated Financial Statements found in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 27, 2022. We have made available to Ernst & Young LLP all of our financial records and related data in connection with their audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 27, 2022. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Management concluded that based on its assessment, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of August 27, 2022.\nMaterial Weakness\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nOur management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the revenue and accounts receivable process, primarily due to ineffective information technology general controls (ITGCs) in the area of user access over the CRM system that we are in the process of deploying. This issue was attributable to numerous role security defects that we experienced in the application and uncertainty that additional role security defects would not arise. Our business process controls within the revenue and accounts receivable process, both automated and manual, that are dependent on the completeness and accuracy of the information derived from the affected IT system were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted.\nOur independent registered accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP has issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 27, 2022, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFollowing identification of the material weakness and prior to filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed substantive procedures for the year ended August 27, 2022 over our revenue and accounts receivable balances. Based on these procedures, management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have certified in certifications furnished with this Annual Report on Form 10-K that, to the best of their knowledge, the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Ernst & Young LLP has issued an unqualified opinion on our financial statements, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRemediation\nManagement is currently working with the application provider to implement near-term and longer-term security enhancements to the CRM system that will provide improved control over user access. We believe that these actions as well as other enhancements to our business process controls, both automated and manual, will enable us to remediate the material weakness. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We currently believe that the remediation of the material weakness will be completed by the end of our fiscal 2023.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of UniFirst Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited UniFirst Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of August 27, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, UniFirst Corporation (and subsidiaries) (the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 27, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in managements assessment. Management has identified a material weakness in controls related to the Companys revenue and accounts receivable process. The material weakness is the result of the aggregate effect of: (i) ineffective information technology (IT) controls over user access and security related to a new billing system that supports the revenue and accounts receivable process for a material volume of transactions and locations and (ii) design and operating deficiencies for certain transaction level controls within the revenue and accounts receivable process. As a result of the ineffective IT controls, process level automated controls and manual controls that are dependent on the completeness and accuracy of information derived from the affected IT system were concluded to be ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of UniFirst Corporation as of August 27, 2022 and August 28, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 27, 2022, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) of the Company. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the fiscal 2022 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated October 25, 2022, which expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nOctober 26, 2022 ITEM 9B.
