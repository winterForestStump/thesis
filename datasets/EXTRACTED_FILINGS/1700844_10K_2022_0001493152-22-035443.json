    "content": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIf we are unable to continue to innovate, meet evolving market trends, adapt to changing customer demands and maintain our culture of innovation, our ability to sustain and grow our business may suffer.\nThe ongoing success of our business depends on our ability to continue to introduce innovative eco-friendly HVAC products to meet evolving market trends and satisfy changing customer demands. We must continue to adapt by innovating, improving our products and modifying our strategies, which could cause us to incur substantial costs. We may not be able to continue to innovate or adapt to changing market and customer needs in a timely and cost-effective manner, if at all. This could adversely impact our ability to expand our ecosystem and grow our business. Failure to develop new products to meet evolving market demands through innovation could cause us to lose current and potential customers and harm our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, we may not be able to maintain our culture of innovation, which has been critical to our success and has helped us create value for our shareholders, succeed as a leader in eco-friendly HVAC products, attract, retain and motivate employees and other ecosystem participants. Among other challenges, we may not be able to identify and promote people into leadership positions who share our culture and also focus on technology and innovation. Competitive pressure may also cause us to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision and values. If we cannot maintain our culture of innovation, our long-term business prospect could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to concentration risk of heavy reliance on our largest nano copper supplier for the supply of nano copper solution for our INCU technology, and any shortage of, or delay in, the supply may significantly impact on our business and results of operation.\nWe source INCU nano copper solution for incorporation of our INCU technology into our air purifier products for sale to our customers from our largest nano copper supplier. As such, we rely on the ability and efficiency of our largest supplier to supply products. Our purchase from our largest nano copper supplier amounted to approximately $279,067 and $170,305 for FYE2022 and FYE 2021, respectively, representing approximately 63.24% and 29.07% of our total purchases, respectively. Our purchases from our top largest supplier accounted for a significant portion of our total purchases for FYE2022 and FYE2021.\n11 | Page\nAs we do not engage in manufacturing of INCU solution, our business, financial condition and operating results for our air purifier system depends on the continuous supply of products from our largest suppliers and our continuous supplier-customer relationship with them. Our heavy reliance on our largest supplier for the supply of INCU solution will have significant impact on our air purifier business and results of operation in the event of any shortage of, or delay in the supply. Our product supply may also be disrupted by potential labor disputes, strike action or natural disasters or other accidents affecting our largest supplier. If our largest suppliers do not supply products to us in a timely manner or in sufficient quantities, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. Any shortage of, disruption, or delay in the supply, or our inability to obtain supplies from alternative sources will have significant impact on our business and results of operation.\nWe entered into a long term original design manufacturer supply agreement (the ODM Supply Agreement) with our largest nano copper solution supplier in September, 2020. As is customary in the supply or sales arrangements, the agreements with our largest supplier are terminable by either party by giving notice. We cannot guarantee that our largest suppliers will not terminate the agreements before the expiry of the agreements. In the event that our largest suppliers terminate the agreements, we will have to source products from other suppliers and we may not be able to secure a similar supply of products with quantity and quality required to support our business or at all. Such termination may therefore have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results if we fail to engage any other suppliers with similar standards before the termination.\nThere is no assurance that our major nano copper supplier and supplier of raw materials for our other products will continue to supply their products in the quantities and timeframes required by us to meet the demand of our customers or comply with their supply agreements with us. If our major supplier do not supply products to us in a timely manner or in sufficient quantities, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, in the event of any delay in delivery of the products to us, our cash flow or working capital may be materially and adversely affected as a result of the corresponding delay in delivery of our products to our customers, and hence the delay in our receipt of payment from our customers.\nFurthermore, our largest nano copper supplier may change their existing sales or marketing strategy in respect of the products supplied to us by changing its export strategy, reducing its sales or production volume or changing its selling prices. As a result, there is no assurance that our largest supplier will not appoint other agents, dealers or distributors which may compete with us in the market where we operate. Furthermore, any significant increase in the selling prices of the products which we source from our largest suppliers will increase our costs and may materially and adversely affect our profit margin if we are not able to pass the increased costs on to our customers.\nThere is no assurance that there will be no deterioration in our relationship with our largest supplier which could affect our ability to secure sufficient supply of products for our business. In the event that our largest supplier change their sales or marketing strategy or otherwise appoint other dealers or distributors who may compete with us, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe operate in a competitive industry, and if we fail to compete effectively, our business could suffer.\nThe air-conditioning and air purifying industry in Asia is highly competitive. Competition in our HVAC products includes several multinational, regional and local companies, the largest players\u202fof which include Daikin Industries, Gree Electric, Trane Technologies, Johnson Controls, Lennox International, Midea Group and Mitsubishi Electric. Sales depend on price, product availability, delivery schedule, product performance, product line breadth, brand reputation, design, technical expertise and service. In addition to established players, we face competition from new market entrants. Increased competition may lead to a loss of market share, increased difficulty in launching new service offerings, reduction in revenue or increase in loss, any one of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n12 | Page\nIn certain of our businesses, our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. Our bids are based upon, among other factors, the cost to timely provide the products and services. To generate an acceptable return, we must accurately estimate our costs and schedule. If we fail to do so, the profitability of contracts may be materially and adversely affected - including because some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages if we do not perform on time - which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nIf we are unable to create brand influence, we may not be able to maintain current or attract new users and customers for our products.\nOur operational and financial performance is highly dependent on the strength of our brand. We believe brand familiarity and preference will continue to have a significant role in winning over customers. In order to further expand our customer base, we may need to substantially increase our marketing expenditures to enhance brand awareness through various online and offline means. Moreover, negative coverage in the media of our company could threaten the perception of our brand, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to defuse negative press coverage about our company to the satisfaction of our investors, customers and suppliers. If we are unable to defuse negative press coverage about our company, our brand may suffer in the marketplace, our operational and financial performance may be negatively impacted.\nCurrently, we sell our products, under our various product line brands, to domestic customers in Malaysia and to overseas customers. However, if our competitors initiate a lawsuit against us for infringing their trademarks, we may be forced to adopt a new brand name for our products. As a result, we may incur additional marketing cost to raise awareness of such new brand name. We may also be ordered to pay a significant amount of damages, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. We operate in a competitive environment and our profitability and competitive position depend on our ability to accurately estimate the costs and timing of providing our products and services.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on intellectual property laws in Malaysia and other jurisdictions to protect our patents trademarks. We are in the process of registering patents in Malaysia, China, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan as well as Patent Cooperation Treaty and trademarks in Malaysia and China. We cannot assure you that counterfeiting or imitation of our products will not occur in the future or, if it does occur, that we will be able to address the problem in a timely and effective manner. Any occurrence of counterfeiting or imitation of our products or other infringement of our intellectual property rights could negatively affect our brand and our reputation, which in turn adversely affects the results of our operations.\nLitigation to prosecute infringement of our intellectual property rights could be costly and lengthy and will divert our managerial and financial resources. We will have to bear costs of the intellectual property litigation and may be unable to recover such costs from our opposite parties. Protracted litigation could also result in our customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our products until such litigation is resolved. The occurrence of any of the foregoing will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change and regulations associated with climate change could adversely affect our business.\nThe effects of climate change, including extreme weather conditions, create financial risks to our business. The effects of climate change could disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials and by increasing insurance and other operating costs. The effects of climate change also may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in the areas most prone to physical risks, which could similarly increase our operating and material costs. We could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain that could result in higher prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them.\nThere is a general consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are linked to climate change, and that these emissions must be reduced dramatically to avert its worst effects. As a result, increased public awareness and concern about climate change will likely continue to (1) generate more international, regional and/or national requirements to curtail the use of high global warming potential refrigerants (which are essential to many of our products); (2) increase building energy efficiency; and (3) cause a shift away from the use of fossil fuels as an energy source. While our products are focused to be eco-friendly, nonetheless, these requirements may render some of the existing technology, particularly some of our products that require refrigerant use, non-compliant or obsolete. While we continue to be committed to developing eco-friendly sustainable solutions for our products, there can be no assurance that our development efforts will be successful, that our products will be accepted by the market, that proposed regulations or deregulation will not have an adverse effect on our competitive position, or that economic returns will reflect our investments in new product development.\n13 | Page\nThe inconsistent international, regional and/or national requirements associated with climate change regulations also create economic and regulatory uncertainty. There is also regulatory and budgetary uncertainty associated with government incentives, which, if discontinued, could adversely impact the demand for energy-efficient buildings and could increase costs of compliance.\nOur business and financial performance depend on continued and substantial investments in our information technology infrastructure, which may not yield anticipated benefits and which may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks.\nThe efficient operation of our business requires continued and substantial investments in information technology (IT) infrastructure systems. The failure to design, develop and implement new IT technology infrastructure systems in an effective and timely manner or to maintain existing systems could divert managements attention and resources. Our information systems may also become obsolete because of inadequate investments, requiring an unplanned transition to a new platform that could be time consuming, costly, and damaging to our competitive position and could require additional management attention. Repeated or prolonged interruptions of service because of poor execution, inadequate investments or obsolescence could have a significant adverse impact on our reputation and our ability to sell products and services.\nIn addition, our business may be impacted by disruptions to our or third-party IT infrastructure, which could result from (among other causes) cyber-attacks, infrastructure failures or compromises to our physical security. Cyber-based risks are evolving and include attacks: (i) on our IT infrastructure (ii) targeting the security, integrity and/or availability of hardware and software; (iii) on information installed, stored or transmitted in our products (including after the purchase of those products and when they are installed into third-party products); and (iv) on facilities or similar infrastructure. Such attacks could disrupt our systems (or those of third parties) and business operations, impact the ability of our products to work as intended or result in the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of information in violation of applicable law and/or contractual obligations. We have experienced cyber-based attacks and, due to the evolving threat landscape, may continue to experience them going forward, potentially with more frequency or severity. We continue to make investments and adopt measures to enhance our protection, detection, response and recovery capabilities, and to mitigate potential risks to our technology, products, services, operations and confidential data. However, depending on the nature, sophistication and scope of cyber-attacks, it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period. As a result, we could potentially experience: (i) production downtimes; (ii) operational delays or other detrimental impacts on our operations; (iii) destruction or corruption of data; (iv) security breaches; (v) manipulation or improper use of our or third-party systems, networks or products; and (vi) financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, liability, penalties, fines and/or damage to our reputation-any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Due to the evolving nature of such risks, the impact of any potential incident cannot be predicted. In addition, because of the global nature of our business, our internal systems and products must comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards in a number of jurisdictions, and government enforcement actions and violations of data privacy and cybersecurity laws could be costly or interrupt our business operations. Any disruption to our business arising from such issues, or an increase in our costs to cover these issues that is greater than what we have anticipated, could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\n14 | Page\nWe depend on our intellectual property and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers. Infringement of or the failure to protect that intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success.\nThe Companys intellectual property rights are important to our business and include numerous patents, trademarks, proprietary technology, technical data, business processes and other confidential information. Although we consider our intellectual property rights in the aggregate to be valuable, we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single intellectual property right or any group of them. We nonetheless rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, nondisclosure agreements, customer and supplier agreements, license agreements, information technology security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. Our efforts to protect such intellectual property and proprietary information may not be sufficient, however.\nWe cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications.\nIn addition, we may be the target of competitor or other third-party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent the sale and marketing of certain of our products. Our competitive position also may be adversely impacted by limitations on our ability to obtain possession, ownership or necessary licenses concerning data important to the development or sale of our products or service offerings, or by limitations on our ability to restrict the use by others of data related to our products or services. Any of these events or factors could subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nWe use a variety of raw materials and supplier-provided parts in our business. Significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints or production disruptions, price increases, or tariffs could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products.\nOur reliance on suppliers and commodity markets to secure components and raw materials (such as copper and steel as well as INCU ionic copper solution), and on service providers to deliver our products, exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials and services. That potential volatility is particularly acute in certain instances where we depend upon a single source. Issues with suppliers (such as delivery or production disruptions, capacity constraints, quality issues, consolidations, closings or bankruptcies), price increases, raw material shortages, or the decreased availability of trucks and other delivery services could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs.\nWe use various strategies to lock in prices of expected purchases of certain raw materials; however, these efforts could cause us to pay higher prices for a commodity when compared with the market price at the time the commodity is actually purchased or delivered. Tariffs can also increase our costs, the impact of which is difficult to predict. However, we believe that our supply management and production practices appropriately balance the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, these risks may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\n15 | Page\nWe design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies. The introduction of new products and technologies involves risks, and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated.\nOur future success depends on designing, developing, producing, selling and supporting innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. The regulations applicable to our products, as well as our customers product and service needs, change from time to time. Moreover, regulatory changes may render our products and technologies non-compliant. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements or product improvements - including those associated with regulatory changes - depends on a variety of factors, including: meeting development, production, and regulatory approval schedules; meeting performance plans and expectations; the availability of raw materials and parts; our suppliers performance; the hiring, training and deployment of qualified personnel; achieving efficiencies; identifying emerging regulatory and technological trends; validating innovative technologies; the level of customer interest in new technologies and products; and the costs and customer acceptance of our new or improved products.\nFailure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our reputation with customers and negatively impact our results.\nProduct and service quality issues could harm customer confidence in our company and our brands. If certain of our product offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers expectations regarding safety or quality, we can experience lost sales and increased costs and we can and have been exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks. Actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to litigation as well as government enforcement actions, which has also occurred in certain instances. In addition, when our products fail to perform as expected, we are exposed to warranty, product liability claims, personal injury and other claims.\nWe maintain strict quality controls and procedures. However, we cannot be certain that these controls and procedures will reveal defects in our products or their raw materials, which may not become apparent until after the products have been placed in use in the market. Accordingly, there is a risk that products will have defects, which could require a product recall. Product recalls can be expensive to implement, and may damage our reputation, customer relationships and market share.\nIn many jurisdictions, product liability claims are not limited to any specified amount of recovery. If any such claims or contribution requests or requirements exceed our available insurance or if there is a product recall, there could be an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, a recall or claim could require us to review our entire product portfolio to assess whether similar issues are present in other products, which could result in a significant disruption to our business and which could have a further adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will not experience any material warranty or product liability claim losses in the future, that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims or that we will have adequate reserves to cover any recalls, repair and replacement costs.\nWe are subject to litigation, environmental, and other legal and compliance risks.\nWe are subject to a variety of litigation, legal and compliance risks. These risks relate to, among other things, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, taxes, environmental matters, employee health and safety, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. If found responsible in connection with such matters, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments and other damages (in certain cases, treble damages), and experience reputational harm.\nAs a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. Those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. They may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses. Uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we operate, structure our investments and enforce our rights.\n16 | Page\nChanges in environmental and climate change related-laws could require additional investments in product designs, which may be more expensive or difficult to manufacture, qualify and sell and/or may involve additional product safety risks and could increase environmental compliance expenditures.\nAt times we are involved in disputes with private parties over environmental issues, including litigation over the allocation of cleanup costs, alleged personal injuries and property damage. Existing and future asbestos-related claims could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions. Property damage lawsuits may involve claims relating to environmental damage or diminution of real estate values. Even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have, or previously had, significant operations or where certain of our products have been manufactured and used.\nOur failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, or effectively manage our employees, customers and business partners, could severely damage our reputation, and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are subject to risks in relation to actions taken by us, our employees, third-party customers or third-party suppliers that constitute violations of the anti-corruption laws and regulations. While we adopt strict internal procedures and work closely with relevant government agencies to ensure compliance of our business operations with relevant laws and regulations, our efforts may not be sufficient to ensure that we comply with relevant laws and regulations at all times. If we, our employees, third-party customers or third-party suppliers violate these laws, rules or regulations, we could be subject to fines and/or other penalties. Actions by Malaysia regulatory authorities or the courts to provide an alternative interpretation of the laws and regulations or to adopt additional anti-bribery or anti-corruption related regulations could also require us to make changes to our operations. Our reputation, corporate image, and business operations may be materially and adversely affected if we fail to comply with these measures or become the target of any negative publicity as a result of actions taken by us, our employees, third-party customers or third-party suppliers.\nOur business depends on the continued contributions made by Low Wai Koon (Dr. Low), as our founder, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board, the loss of who may result in a severe impediment to our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nOur success is dependent upon the continued contributions made by founder, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board, Dr. Low. We rely on his expertise in business operations when we are developing our business. We have no Key Man insurance to cover the resulting losses in the event that any of our officer or directors should die or resign. In order to mitigate this risk, the Group has continued to invest in its personnel training as well as investment into its research and development department.\nHowever, if Dr. Low cannot serve the Company or is no longer willing to do so, the Company may not be able to find alternatives in a timely manner or at all. This would likely result in a severe damage to our business operations and would have an adverse material impact on our financial position and operating results. To sustain our operations, the Company may have to recruit and train replacement personnel at a higher cost. In addition, if Dr. Low joins our competitors or develops similar businesses that are in competition with our Company, our business, results of operation and financial conditions may also be negatively impacted.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 has severely constrained economic activity and, as a result, has caused a significant contraction in the global economy. In response to this outbreak, governments have taken preventive or protective actions, including imposing restrictions on business operations and travel. Governments have also implemented economic stabilization efforts and other measures to mitigate the economic effects of the outbreak; however, the effectiveness and continuation of those measures remains uncertain. Specifically, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its spread, the Malaysian government has implemented intermittent lockdowns in various stages such as (i) imposing full movement control orders (MCO), under which, quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of stores and facilities in Malaysia were made mandatory; (ii) easing MCO to a Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) under which most business sectors were allowed to operate under strict rules and Standard Operating Procedures mandated by the government of Malaysia; and (iii) further easing CMCO to Recovery Movement Control Order. On January 12, 2021, due to a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, the Malaysian government declared a state of emergency nationwide to combat COVID-19. On February 16, 2021, the government announced that a National COVID-19 Immunization Plan will be implemented for one year after February 2021, in which 80% of the Malaysian population will be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. On March 5, 2021, lockdowns in most parts of the country were eased to a CMCO, however, COVID-19 cases in the country continued to rise. On May 12, 2021, the Malaysian government re-imposed a full lockdown order nationwide, until the earlier of when (i) daily COVID-19 infection cases in the country fall below 4,000; (ii) intensive care unit wards start operating at a moderate level; or (iii) 10% of the Malaysian population is fully vaccinated. The total number of COVID-19 cases in the country surpassed three million on February 13, 2022, and the number of daily cases hit a record high of 33,406 on March 5, 2022.\n17 | Page\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Since we lease offices in Malaysia, Cambodia and China for our business operations, the COVID-19 outbreak caused temporary office and factory closures from late March to May 2020, resulting in lower work efficiency and productivity. The nature and extent of the continuing impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the recent and pending approvals of vaccines, the wide-spread distribution of vaccines and the effectiveness of such vaccines in preventing COVID-19, and the time it takes to vaccinate global populations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created unique global and industry-wide challenges, including challenges to our business. Nonetheless, further prolonged closures and restrictions throughout the world or the rollback of reopening measures due to a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and continued decreases in the general level of economic activity may again disrupt our operations and the operations of our suppliers, distributors and customers.\nAs a result of the foregoing, the pandemic and its impact have also affected and could continue to affect the ability of our customers to pay for our products and services and to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, which has resulted in, and could further result in, a decrease and/or cancellation of orders and/or payment delays or defaults. Such conditions may also adversely affect our supply base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy, which could impact our ability to fulfil orders on time or at the anticipated cost. We also may be required to raise additional capital in the future and our access to and cost of financing will depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our results of operations and our credit ratings. There is no guarantee that financing will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that it will be available on terms consistent with our expectations. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n18 | Page\nThe war between Russia and Ukraine could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn February 24, 2022, Russian military forces launched a military action in Ukraine, and sustained conflict and disruption in the region is likely. The length, impact, and outcome of this ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable and could lead to significant market and other disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices and supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets, supply chain interruptions, political and social instability, trade disputes or trade barriers, changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, as well as an increase in cyberattacks and espionage.\nThe war has led to significant sanctions programs imposed by the U.S., the European Union, the UK, Canada, Switzerland, Japan, and other countries against Russia, Belarus, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk Peoples Republic, and the so-called Luhansk Peoples Republic, including, among others:\n\u25cf blocking sanctions against some of the largest state-owned and private Russian financial institutions (and their subsequent removal from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication payment system) and certain Russian businesses, some of which have significant financial and trade ties to the European Union;\n\u25cf blocking sanctions against Russian and Belarusian individuals, including the Russian President, other politicians, and those with government connections or involved in Russian military activities;\n\u25cf blocking of Russias foreign currency reserves as well as expansion of sectoral sanctions and export and trade restrictions, limitations on investments and access to capital markets, and bans on various Russian imports; and\n\u25cf enhanced export controls and trade sanctions targeting Russias imports of technological goods as a whole, including tighter controls on exports and reexports of dual-use items, stricter licensing policy with respect to issuing export licenses, and/or increased use of end-use controls to block or impose licensing requirements on exports, as well as higher import tariffs and a prohibition on exporting luxury goods to Russia and Belarus.\nIn retaliation against new international sanctions and as part of measures to stabilize and support the volatile Russian financial and currency markets, the Russian authorities also imposed significant currency control measures aimed at restricting the outflow of foreign currency and capital from Russia, imposed various restrictions on transacting with non-Russian parties, banned exports of various products, and imposed other economic and financial restrictions. The situation is rapidly evolving, and additional sanctions by Russia on the one hand, and by the other countries on the other hand, could adversely affect the global economy, financial markets, energy supply and prices, certain critical materials and metals, supply chains, and global logistics and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business must be conducted in compliance with applicable economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations, including those administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the United Nations Security Council, and other relevant governmental authorities. If we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control laws, it could result in substantial fines and penalties for us and for individuals working for us. We are actively monitoring the situation in Ukraine and Russia and assessing its impact on our business, including our business partners, employees and customers. To date, we have not experienced any material interruptions in our infrastructure, supplies, technology systems, or networks needed to support our operations. The conflict has caused us to modify our operations in Russia and could lead to additional modifications in Russia. We cannot predict the progress or outcome of the war or its impacts in the territories where we operate. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions, other consequences, such as Russia imposing restrictions on transactions or banning the export of energy products, including natural gas, and the resulting market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have substantial impact on the global economy and our business for an unknown period of time. Any such disruption may also magnify the impact of other risks described in this section.\n19 | Page\nRisks Related to Doing Business in Malaysia\nDevelopments in the social, political, regulatory and economic environment in Malaysia may have a material adverse impact on us.\nOur business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by social, political, regulatory and economic developments in Malaysia. Such political and economic uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks of war, terrorism, nationalism, nullification of contract, changes in interest rates, imposition of capital controls and methods of taxation.\nNegative developments in Malaysias socio-political environment may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The Malaysian economy registered GDP growth of approximately 14.2% year on year growth for Q3 2022, according to the Department of Statistics Malaysia. Although the overall Malaysian economic environment (in which we predominantly operate) appears to be positive, there can be no assurance that this will continue to prevail in the future. Economic growth is determined by countless factors, and it is extremely difficult to predict with any level of absolute certainty. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization or WHO declared the coronavirus or COVID-19 a pandemic. Governments have also implemented economic stabilization efforts and other measures to mitigate the economic effects of the outbreak; however, the effectiveness and continuation of those measures remains uncertain. Specifically, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its spread, the Malaysian government has implemented intermittent lockdowns in various stages such as (i) imposing full movement control orders (MCO), under which, quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of stores and facilities in Malaysia were made mandatory; (ii) easing MCO to a Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) under which most business sectors were allowed to operate under strict rules and Standard Operating Procedures mandated by the government of Malaysia; and (iii) further easing CMCO to Recovery Movement Control Order. On January 12, 2021, due to a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, the Malaysian government declared a state of emergency nationwide to combat COVID-19. On February 16, 2021, the government announced that a National COVID-19 Immunization Plan will be implemented for one year after February 2021, in which 80% of the Malaysian population will be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. On March 5, 2021, lockdowns in most parts of the country were eased to a CMCO, however, COVID-19 cases in the country continued to rise. On May 12, 2021, the Malaysian government re-imposed a full lockdown order nationwide, until the earlier of when (i) daily COVID-19 infection cases in the country fall below 4,000; (ii) intensive care unit wards start operating at a moderate level; or (iii) 10% of the Malaysian population is fully vaccinated. The total number of COVID-19 cases in the country surpassed three million on February 13, 2022, and the number of daily cases hit a record high of 33,406 on March 5, 2022. As such, the extent to which the coronavirus may continue to adversely impact the Malaysian economy is uncertain. In the event that the Malaysia economy suffers, demand for our products may diminish, which would in turn result in our profitability. This could in turn result in a substantial need for restructuring of our business objectives and could result in a partial or entire loss of an investment in our Company.\nWe are subject to foreign exchange control policies in Malaysia.\nThe ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us may be restricted by the foreign exchange control policies in the countries where we operate. For example, there are foreign exchange policies in Malaysia which support the monitoring of capital flows into and out of the country in order to preserve its financial and economic stability. The foreign exchange policies are administered by the Foreign Exchange Administration, an arm of Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), the central bank of Malaysia. The foreign exchange policies monitor and regulate both residents and non-residents. Under the current Foreign Exchange Administration rules issued by BNM, non-residents are free to repatriate any amount of funds from Malaysia in foreign currency other than the currency of Israel at any time (subject to limited exceptions), including capital, divestment proceeds, profits, dividends, rental, fees and interest arising from investment in Malaysia, subject to any withholding tax. In the event BNM or any other country where we operate introduces any restrictions in the future, we may be affected in our ability to repatriate dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries in Malaysia or in such other countries. Since we are a holding company and rely principally on dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries for our cash requirements, any restrictions on such dividends or other payments could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operation.\n20 | Page\nEconomic, market and political developments in the countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nAs with all organizations that seek to reduce business risks via geographical expansion, the economic, market and political conditions in other countries, particularly emerging market conditions in Southeast Asia, could have an influence on our business. Any widespread global financial instability or a significant loss of investor confidence in emerging market economies may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects or reputation.\nExamples of such external factors or conditions that are outside our control include, but are not limited to the following:\n\u25cf general economic, political and social conditions in Southeast Asian markets;\n\u25cf consumer spending patterns in our key markets;\n\u25cf currency and interest rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf international events and circumstances such as wars, terrorist attacks, natural disasters and political instability; and\n\u25cf changes in legal regimes and governmental regulations, such as licensing and approvals, taxation, duties and tariffs, in key markets and abroad.\nFor example, the global financial markets experienced significant disruptions in 2008 and the United States, Europe and other economies went into recession. The recovery from the lows of 2008 and 2009 was uneven and the global economy has continued to face new challenges. There is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies that have been adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the worlds leading economies, including the United States. For example, in 2013, the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States announced the tapering of its bond-buying program which led to a high degree of volatility in equity markets and substantial devaluations in the currencies of many emerging economies, including markets where we operate. Economic conditions in the countries where we operate might be sensitive to global economic conditions, as well as changes in domestic economic and political policies and the expected or perceived overall economic growth rate in emerging markets. Furthermore, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. As at November 30, 2021, the coronavirus continues to impact the global economy.\n21 | Page\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property and information, and protect against third party claims that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe value of our business depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property including our patents applications and trademarks, as well as our customer, employee, and customer data. Third parties may try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in Asia and around the world. In addition, intellectual property rights and protections in Malaysia may be insufficient to protect material intellectual property rights. Further, our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property. We may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. If we fail to protect our proprietary intellectual property and information, including with respect to any successful challenge to our ownership of intellectual property or material infringements of our intellectual property, this failure could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if we are accused of infringing on the intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce or defend our rights.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our success in obtaining and maintaining patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights in Malaysia and elsewhere and protecting our proprietary technology. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, competitors may be able to use our technologies or the goodwill we have acquired in the marketplace and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability.\nWe cannot provide any assurances that any of our pending patent applications that mature into issued patents will include a scope sufficient to protect our products, any additional features we develop for our products or any new products. Other parties may have developed technologies that may be related or competitive to our system, may have filed or may file patent applications and may have received or may receive patents that overlap or conflict with our patent applications, either by claiming the same methods or devices or by claiming subject matter that could dominate our patent position. Our patent position may involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, the scope, validity and enforceability of any patent claims that we may obtain cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented. Proceedings challenging our patents could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. In addition, such proceedings may be costly. Thus, any patents that we may own may not provide any protection against competitors. Furthermore, an adverse decision in an interference proceeding can result in a third party receiving the patent right sought by us, which in turn could affect our ability to commercialize our products.\nThough an issued patent is presumed valid and enforceable, its issuance is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability and it may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products. Competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our patents, or develop and obtain patent protection for more effective technologies, designs or methods.\nWe may be unable to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or trade secrets by consultants, suppliers, vendors, former employees and current employees.\nOur ability to enforce our patent rights depends on our ability to detect infringement. It may be difficult to detect infringers who do not advertise the components that are used in their products. Moreover, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain evidence of infringement in a competitors or potential competitors product. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded if we were to prevail may not be commercially meaningful.\nIn addition, proceedings to enforce or defend our patents could put our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. Such proceedings could also provoke third parties to assert claims against us, including that some or all of the claims in one or more of our patents are invalid or otherwise unenforceable. If any of our patents covering our products are invalidated or found unenforceable, or if a court found that valid, enforceable patents held by third parties covered one or more of our products, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce or defend our rights.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u25cf any of our pending patent applications, if issued, will include claims having a scope sufficient to protect our products;\n\u25cf any of our pending patent applications will be issued as patents;\n\u25cf we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u25cf others will not develop similar or alternative technologies that do not infringe our patents; any of our patents will be found to ultimately be valid and enforceable;\n\u25cf any patents issued to us will provide a basis for an exclusive market for our commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u25cf we will develop additional proprietary technologies or products that are separately patentable; or\n\u25cf our commercial activities or products will not infringe upon the patents of others.\nWe rely, in part, upon unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. Further, our trade secrets could otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors.\n22 | Page\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nThere may not be sufficient liquidity in the market for our securities in order for investors to sell their securities.\nThere is currently only a limited public market for our ordinary share, which is listed on the Over-the-Counter Pink Sheets, and there can be no assurance that a trading market will develop further or be maintained in the future.\nThe market price of our ordinary share may be volatile.\nThe market price of our ordinary share has been and will likely continue to be highly volatile, as is the stock market in general, and the market for OTC Pink Sheet quoted stocks in particular. Some of the factors that may materially affect the market price of our ordinary share are beyond our control, such as changes in financial estimates by industry and securities analysts, conditions or trends in the industry in which we operate or sales of our ordinary share. These factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our ordinary share, regardless of our performance. In addition, the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our ordinary share.\nOur ordinary share may be considered a penny stock and may be difficult to sell.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a penny stock to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our ordinary share is less than $5.00 per share and, therefore, it may be designated as a penny stock according to SEC rules. This designation requires any broker or dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell our ordinary share and may affect the ability of investors to sell their shares.\nThe market for penny stocks has experienced numerous frauds and abuses, which could adversely impact investors in our stock.\nOTC Pink Sheet securities are frequent targets of fraud or market manipulation, both because of their generally low prices and because OTC Pink Sheet reporting requirements are less stringent than those of the stock exchanges or NASDAQ.\nPatterns of fraud and abuse include:\n\u25cf Control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer;\n\u25cf Manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases;\n\u25cf Boiler room practices involving high pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons;\n\u25cf Excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and mark-ups by selling broker-dealers; and\n\u25cf Wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the inevitable collapse of those prices with consequent investor losses.\n\u25cf Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never paid any cash dividends on our ordinary share and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our ordinary share in the foreseeable future and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our stock. We plan to retain any future earnings to finance growth.\n23 | Page\nGeneral Risks\nNatural disasters, epidemics or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations, adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and may not be fully covered by insurance.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, power outages or other unexpected events, including hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, floods and other forms of severe weather, health epidemics, pandemics (including COVID-19) or other contagious outbreaks, conflicts, wars or terrorist acts, in the U.S. or in other countries in which we or our suppliers or customers operate could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, power outages or other unexpected events could damage or close one or more of our facilities or disrupt our operations temporarily or long-term, such as by causing business interruptions or by affecting the availability and/or cost of materials needed for manufacturing. We have only one factory and another assembly line that can manufacture a specific product or product line. As a result, damage to or the closure of that factory may disrupt or prevent us from manufacturing certain products. Existing insurance arrangements may not cover all of the costs or lost cash flows that may arise from such events. The occurrence of any of these events could also increase our insurance and other operating costs or harm our sales.\nWe may be affected by global economic, capital market and political conditions, and conditions in the construction, transportation and infrastructure industries in particular.\nOur business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks and conditions, including credit market conditions, levels of consumer and business confidence, fluctuations in residential, commercial and industrial construction activity, pandemic health issues (including COVID-19 and its effects), natural disasters, commodity prices, energy costs, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, levels of government spending and deficits, trade policies (including tariffs, boycotts and sanctions), regulatory changes, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy.\nThese economic and political conditions affect our business in a number of ways. At this point, the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact the global economy remains uncertain, but pandemics or other significant public health events, or the perception that such events may occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, the tightening of credit in the capital markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers, including individual end-customers and businesses, to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, which could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services. Similarly, tightening credit may adversely affect our supply base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. Additionally, because we have a number of factories and suppliers in foreign countries, the imposition of tariffs or sanctions or unusually restrictive border crossing rules could adversely affect our supply chain, operations and overall business.\nOur business and financial performance is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending and construction (both residential and commercial as well as remodelling).\nOur business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nOur ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have leadership with the necessary skill sets and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives, execute our strategic plan and effectively transition our leadership. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES\nThe Companys principal executive office is located at 31-A2, Jalan 5/32A, 6 \u00bd Miles off Jalan Kepong, 52000 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We believe that our existing factories operating in the Peoples Republic of China and Malaysia, which are described above, are well maintained and in good operating condition, and will be sufficient for our production goals for the next year. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nOn October 8, 2021, a filing (the Filing) was made with the Kuala Lumpur High Court by a reseller (the Reseller) of the Companys INCU ionic nano copper solution (the Solution) and the Resellers related party (together with the Reseller, the Plaintiffs).\nThe Reseller was authorized by WKL Eco Earths sole distributor of the Solution (the WKL Distributor) to resell the Solution together with a diffuser with a capacity of not more than 1000ml through a tripartite agreement (the Tripartite Agreement) entered into between (a) the Reseller, (b) the WKL Distributor and (c) a solution packaging company (the Packaging Company). WKL Eco Earth was not a party to the Tripartite Agreement and did not directly authorize or engage the Reseller in the resale of the Solution.\nIn the Filing, the Plaintiffs claimed against (i) WKL Eco Earth; (ii) Dr. Low; (iii) Chan Kok Wei, (iv) the Packaging Company and (v) two directors of the Packaging Company for loss and damages arising from an alleged breach of contract, defamation and tort of inducement. The Plaintiffs also alleged that pursuant to the Tripartite Agreement, WKL Eco Earth was prohibited from selling the Solution to any party other than the WKL Distributor and allow for the resale of the Solution by the Plaintiffs without limitation, and that the Plaintiffs were not confined in their resale of the Solution to a diffuser with a capacity of not more than 1000ml.\nThe Company believes the claims are without merit and will defend itself against the claims. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNo report required.\n24 | Page\nPART II ITEM 5.\nMARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMARKET INFORMATION\nThe registrant had 102,003,018 shares of our Common Stock par value, $0.001 issued and outstanding as of December 8, 2022. There were 128 record holders of our common stock.\nDIVIDENDS\nWe have never paid or declared any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nSECURITIES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS\nWe currently do not have any equity compensation plans. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\nNot Applicable. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our audited consolidated financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP).\nPlan of Operation and Funding\nWe expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through internally generated funds and proceeds from issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.\nExisting working capital, proceeds from issuance of securities, further advances, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through internally generated funds and proceeds from issuance of securities. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) research and developmental, (ii) business expansion expenditure and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain selected statement of operations data for the financial year indicated in U.S. Dollars. In addition, we note that the period-to-period comparison may not be indicative of future performance.\nThe following summary of our operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the financial years ended August 31(FYE), 2022, and 2021, which are included herein.\nYear Ended August 31\nChanges %\nRevenue $ 1,190,616 $ 774,805 $ 415,811 54 %\nCost of revenues 952,228 503,116 449,112 89 %\nGross profit 238,388 271,689 (33,301 ) (12 )%\nOperating expenses 4,856,039 1,413,678 3,442,361 244 %\nLoss from operations (4,617,651 ) (1,141,989 ) (3,475, 662 ) 304 %\nOther expense (938,976 ) (23,036 ) (915,940 ) 3,976 %\nNet Loss (5,556,627 ) (1,165,025 ) (4,391,602 ) 377 %\nRevenue\nRevenue for FYE 2022, were $1,190,616 compared to revenue in FYE 2021 of $774,805, an increase of $415,811 or approximately 54%. Our sales increases in the 2022 is attributable to the expansion of customers base, increase of sales from existing customers and expansion of product offerings.\n25 | Page\nCost of Sales\nCost of revenues was $952,228 or 80% of revenues in the FYE 2022, as compared to $503,116 or 65% of revenue in FYE 2021. Cost of revenues includes production cost and purchases of goods. Higher cost of revenues was attributable to manufacturing and related costs for evoairTM products, comprising material costs, labor cost, R&D for product improvement, product testing and inspection, factory rental, depreciation expense as well as sample products for market penetration.\nGross profit\nGross profit was $238,388 for FYE 2022 or 20% of revenues compared to $271,689 in FYE 2021 or 35% of revenues. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales (gross margin) was attributable to the lower gross margin from new product line which has not achieved economy of scale. The decrease of gross profit in 2022 is attributable to the commercialization of evoair productsTM with higher cost of revenue from manufacturing and related costs as well as lack of economy of scale during commercialization stage. The Company anticipates improvement of income and gross profit margin with improvement of revenue streams from distributor and dealership model, projects, and licensing model.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses totaled $4,856,039 for FYE 2022, compared to $1,413,678 in operating expenses for FYE 2021, or an increase of $3,442,361 or 244%. The operating expenses include salary and related expenses, commissions, rental and professional fees. The increase in operating expenses was in line with the growth in business operations and business development, comprising predominantly professional fee, amortization of intangible assets, and compliance cost in relation to our financial reporting, patent, and trademark filings.\nOther income and (expense)\nOther income and expense are comprised of other income and interest expense. Interest expenses was $1,005,498 for the FYE 2022, compared to $25,659 in interest expense for FYE 2021. The increases in other expense were primary attributable to the amortization of beneficial conversion feature of convertible bonds $1,005,645 and offset with other income $66,522. The other income primarily included $26,357 government subsidy, $31,004 product line income, and $9,152 product testing income.\nNet loss\nPremised on the factors discussed above, the Company incurred a net loss from of $5,556,627 for FYE 2022, compared to a net loss of $1,165,025 for FYE 2021. The continuous net loss was attributable to building up of infrastructure and resource to meet the business expansion needs of the Groups as well as lack of economies of scale.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nYear Ended\nAugust 31,\nChanges %\nCurrent assets $ 1,688,926 $ 3,224,772 $ (1,535,846 ) (48 )%\nCurrent liabilities 892,004 1,639,090 (747,086 ) (46 )%\nWorking capital 796,922 1,585,682 (788,760 ) (50 )%\nAs of August 31, 2022, our companys current liabilities stood at $892,004, which included accounts payable and accruals of $216,830, other payable of $31,980, deferred revenue $513,072, current portion hire purchase creditor $10,135, amount due to shareholders $2,301, and current portion operating lease liabilities of $117,686.\n26 | Page\nAs of August 31, 2022, the Company recorded a positive working capital of $796,922 compared with the positive working capital of $1,585,682 as of August 31, 2021. The decrease in working capital was primarily due to decrease in cash and the increase in operation activities.\nCash Flows\nYear Ended\nAugust 31,\nChanges %\nCash flows used in operating activities $ (1,540,167 ) $ (2,001,253 ) $ 461,086 (23 )%\nCash flows used in investing activities (561,315 ) (94,045 ) (467,270 ) 497 %\nCash flows generated from financing activities 454,722 3,288,033 (2,833,311 ) (86 )%\nNet changes in cash (1,646,760 ) 1,192,735 (2,839,495 ) (238 )%\nThe Companys cash and cash equivalents stood at $152,304 as of August 31, 2022. Cash used in operating activities for the year ended August 31, 2022, was $1,540,178. The change was primarily due to increase in net loss offset with increased ROU and intangible assets amortization and more inventories purchased this year.\nCash used in investing activities resulted from purchase of fixed assets amounting to $561,315 for the year ended August 31, 2022.\nDuring the FYE 2022, cash generated from financing activities resulted from proceeds from issuance of common stock amounting to $185,185, payments of hire purchase amounting to $5,308, proceeds from shares to be issued amounting to $75,000, and proceeds from capital contribution amounting to $199,845.\nSeasonality\nThe Companys business is not subject to seasonality.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nRevenue recognition\nOur revenue recognition policy is in compliance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers whereby revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods. We apply the following five-step model to determine this amount:\n(i) identification of the promised goods and services in the contract;\n(ii) determination of whether the promised goods and services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract;\n(iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;\n(iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and\n(v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.\n27 | Page\nWe only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606 at contract inception, we review the contract to determine which performance obligations we must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct. We recognize as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Generally, our performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point in time, typically upon delivery for local sales and upon shipment of the products for export sale.\nFor all reporting periods, we have not disclosed the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for all product revenue contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, which is an optional exemption that is permitted under the adopted rules.\nEstimates and Assumptions\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities, and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. We are also subject to other risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated amounts. Significant estimates in 2022 and 2021 include the assumptions used to value tax liabilities, derivative financial instruments, estimates of the allowance for deferred tax assets, accounts receivable allowance, impairment of long-lived assets and inventory write-offs.\nGoing Concern\nAs of August 31, 2022, and August 31, 2021, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $7,465,373 and $2,233,496 respectively. The Company incurred net loss of $5,556,627 and $1,165,025 for FYE 2022, and FYE 2021, respectively. The cash used in operating activities for the year ended August 31, 2022, was $1,540,167. It was brought to the attention of the Management to assess going concern considering all facts and circumstances about the foreseeable future of the Company as well as its assets and liabilities on the basis that it will be able to realize and discharge them in the normal course of business.\nWith the injection of New Business into the Company contemplated under the Transactions (defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements), the Management believes that the actions to be taken by the Management to further implement the business plans for the New Business including expansion in product offerings, geographical expansion, generate revenue through expansion of revenue streams and customer base (retail, commercial and industrial as well as private label and licensing clientele), as well as improvement of profitability by achieving economies of scale provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. In addition, the Company is also working on raising additional funding to finance the operations as well as business expansion.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and, accordingly the financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nMaterial Commitments\nWe have no material commitments as of August 31, 2022.\n28 | Page\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nExcept for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under the authority of federal securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered standards, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification\u2122 (ASC) is the sole source of authoritative U.S. GAAP literature recognized by the FASB and applicable to the Company. Management has reviewed the aforementioned rules and releases and believes any effect will not have a material impact on the Companys present or future financial statements.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This ASU should be applied prospectively to acquisitions occurring on or after the effective date of December 15, 2022, and early adoption is permitted. There is no material impact on the Companys financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-03 Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments; which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. This ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently assessing the impact of these ASUs on its consolidated financial statements.\nOther recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the SEC did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Companys present or future CFS.

As disclosed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $7,465,373. The Company incurred net loss of $5,231,877 for year ended August 31, 2022. The cash used in operating activities were $1,540,167 for the year ended August 31, 2022. The Company has accumulated loss since inception which raise doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Audit Alliance LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2021.\nSingapore\nDecember 14, 2022\n(PCAOB ID No. 3487)\n30 | Page\nEVOAIR HOLDINGS INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In U.S. Dollars, except share data or otherwise stated)\nAS OF AUGUST 31, 2022 AND AUGUST 31, 2021\nAugust 31, 2022 August 31, 2021\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 152,304 $ 1,714,890\nAccount receivables 85,960 127,802\nInventories 618,996 142,519\nDeposit, prepayments and other receivables 831,666 1,239,561\nTotal current assets 1,688,926 3,224,772\nNon-current assets\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 602,755 136,598\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 442,020 -\nTechnology-related intangible assets, net 80,376,175 -\nTotal non-current assets 81,420,950 136,598\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 83,109,876 $ 3,361,370\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable and accruals $ 216,830 $ 111,894\nOther payables 31,980 33,078\nDeferred revenue 513,072 426,777\nHire purchase creditor 10,135 6,861\nFinancial liability -

The Company has not yet established a sustainable ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern.\nAs of August 31, 2022, and August 31, 2021, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $7,465,373 and $2,233,496 respectively. The Company incurred net loss of $5,231,877 and $1,084,886 for years ended August 31, 2022, and August 31, 2021, respectively. The cash used in operating activities were $1,540,167 and $2,001,253 for the years ended August 31, 2022, and August 31, 2021, respectively. It was brought to the attention of the Management to assess going concern considering all facts and circumstances about the foreseeable future of the Company as well as its assets and liabilities on the basis that it will be able to realize and discharge them in the normal course of business.\nWith the injection of a viable business into the Company (New Business) contemplated under the Transaction (defined in Note 1), the Management believes that the actions to be taken by the new Management to further implement the business plans for the New Business including expansion in product offerings, geographical expansion, generate revenue through expansion of revenue streams and customer base (retail, commercial and industrial as well as private label and licensing clientele), improvement of profitability by achieving economies of scale provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. In addition, the Company is also working on raising additional funding to finance the operations as well as business expansion.\nThe consolidated financials have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and, accordingly financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nNOTE 4 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of presentation and principles of consolidation:\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by EVOH and its subsidiaries (the Group or EvoAir Group) in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for financial information and pursuant to the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EvoAir International, WKL Eco Earth Holdings, WKL Eco Earth, WKL Green Energy, and its 67.5% owned EvoAir Manufacturing which included a 100% owned subsidiary Evo Air Marketing, 55% owned WKL EcoEarth Indochina, and its 55% owned WKL Guanzhe as part of the Transaction contemplated in Note 1.\nAs WKL Eco Earth and WKL Green Energy were under common control at the time of the Transaction, it is required under U.S. GAAP to account for this common control acquisition in a manner similar to the pooling of interest method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, EVOHs consolidated balance sheets as of August 31, 2022, and August 31, 2021, reflect WKL Eco Earth and WKL Green Energy on a historical carryover basis in the assets and liabilities instead of reflecting the fair market value of the assets and liabilities.\n37 | Page\nAll intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of the Management, the accompanying financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly all financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe non-controlling interests are presented in the consolidated balance sheets, separately from equity attributable to the stockholders of the Company. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Company are presented on the face of the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as an allocation of the total loss for the year between non-controlling interest holders and the stockholders of the Company.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods. Key estimates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, among others, revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts and product returns, provisions for obsolete inventory, valuation of long-lived assets and Rights of Use (ROU) assets (including lease liabilities), and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nFiscal Year End\nThe Company operates on a fiscal year basis with the fiscal year ending on August 31.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company places its cash with a high credit quality financial institution.\nWKL Guanzhe business is primarily conducted in China and substantially all of revenues are denominated in RMB. The government of Peoples Republic of China (PRC) imposes control over its foreign currency reserves in part through direct regulation of the conversion of RMB into foreign exchange and through restrictions on foreign trade.\nComprehensive Gain or Loss\nASC 220 Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements. As of August 31, 2022, and August 31, 2021, the Company established that there are items that represented components of comprehensive income and, therefore, has included a statement of comprehensive income in the financial statements.\nBeneficial Conversion Features (BCF)\nIn accordance with FASB ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, the BCF for the convertible instruments is recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of that feature to additional paid-in capital. The intrinsic value is generally calculated at the commitment date as the difference between the conversion price and the fair value of the common stock or other securities into which the security is convertible, multiplied by the number of shares into which the security is convertible. If certain other securities are issued with the convertible security, the proceeds are allocated among the different components. The portion of the proceeds allocated to the convertible security is divided by the contractual number of the conversion shares to determine the effective conversion price, which is used to measure the BCF. The effective conversion price is used to compute the intrinsic value. The value of the BCF is limited to the basis that is initially allocated to the convertible security.\n38 | Page\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of Chinese operations is Chinese Renminbi, (RMB). The functional currency of the Companys Singapore operations is Singapore dollars (SGD). The functional currency of the Companys Malaysia operations is Ringgit Malaysia (RM). Management has adopted ASC 830 Foreign Currency Matters for transactions that occur in foreign currencies. Monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Average monthly rates are used to translate revenues and expenses.\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Exchange gains or losses arising from foreign currency transactions are included in the determination of net income for the respective periods.\nAssets and liabilities of the Companys operations are translated into the reporting currency, United States Dollars, at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the reporting periods. Equity transactions are recorded at the historical rate when the transaction occurred. The resulting translation adjustment is reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders equity in the statement of stockholders equity.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the net value of face amount less any allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Companys best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in the period when loss is probable based on an assessment of specific evidence indicating troubled collection, historical experience, accounts aging and other factors. The Company reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis, and all past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability. An account receivable is written off after all collection effort has ceased. Recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded when received. Interest is not charged on past due accounts.\nAs of August 31, 2022, and August 31, 2021, our accounts receivable amounted to $85,960 and $127,802, respectively, with no allowance for doubtful accounts for both periods.\nInventories\nInventories consist primarily of finished goods, raw materials, and work-in-process (WIP) from WKL Eco Earth, WKL EcoEarth Indochina, WKL Guanzhe, and EvoAir Manufacturing.\nWe value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We determine the cost of inventory using the standard cost method, which approximates actual cost based on a first-in, first-out method. All other costs, including administrative costs, are expensed as incurred.\nDeposit, prepayments, and other receivables\nDeposit, prepayments and other receivables are comprised of prepayments paid to vendors to initiate orders and prepaid services fees and are classified as current assets if such amounts are to be recognized within one year from the balance sheet date.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related capitalized assets. Property and equipment are depreciated over 5 to 10 years.\n39 | Page\nSUMMARY OF ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS\nUseful lives\nPlant and machineries\n5 years\nOffice equipment\n5 years\nVehicles\n5 years\nFurniture and equipment\n10 years\nRenovation\n10 years\nRepair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. At the time of retirement or other disposition of property, plant and equipment, the cost and accumulated depreciation will be removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss, if any, will be reflected in operations.\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nThe Companys intangible assets consist of patents and trademarks related to assignments of intellectual properties by Dr. Low into WKL Eco Earth Holdings under the IP Assignments as contemplated in Note 1. The intangible assets are recorded at fair market value and are amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated life of 20 years for both patents and trademarks.\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that an entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company does not disaggregate its revenue streams as the economic factors underlying the contracts are similar and provide no significant distinction. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.\nThe Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606 at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations the Company must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct. The Company recognizes as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nDeferred Revenue\nThe Company collects deposits from customers in advance for some business contracts. The customer payments received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet. The deferred revenue of $426,777 recorded as of August 31, 2021, was subsequently recognized as revenue in October 2021.The Company recognized $513,072 deferred revenue as of August 31, 2022, with $112,176 recognized as revenue as of the report date.\n40 | Page\nLeases\nWe have entered into operating agreements primarily for office and factory. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. For all classes of underlying assets, we elect not to recognize right of use assets or lease liabilities when a lease has a lease term of 12 months or less at the commencement date and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that we are reasonably certain to exercise. Operating lease assets and liabilities are included on our consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2022.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Operating lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives. Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-cancellable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nOur lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with our lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component, which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company utilizes ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method to compute the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the related financial amounts, using currently enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely-than-not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nThe Companys practice is to recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nMeasurement of Fair Value\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that could be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. A fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. Categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is defined in the following three categories:\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or inputs that are corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.\nEarnings (Loss) per Share\nThe Company computes basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share amounts in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the Company. As of August 31, 2022, the Company has no potentially dilutive securities, such as options or warrants, currently issued and outstanding.\n41 | Page\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nExcept for rules and interpretive releases of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the authority of federal securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered standards, the FASB Accounting Standards Codification\u2122 (ASC) is the sole source of authoritative GAAP literature recognized by the FASB and applicable to the Company. Management has reviewed the aforementioned rules and releases and believes any effect will not have a material impact on the Companys present or future financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 adds a current expected credit loss (CECL) impairment model to U.S. GAAP that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Modified retrospective adoption is required with any cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within the year of adoption. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the application of the CECL impairment model to have a significant impact on its allowance for uncollectible amounts for accounts receivable.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This ASU should be applied prospectively to acquisitions occurring on or after the effective date of December 15, 2022, and early adoption is permitted. There is no material impact on the Companys financial statements.\nNOTE 5 INVENTORIES\nInventories consist of the following:\nSUMMARY OF INVENTORIES\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31,\nFinished goods $ 385,102 $ 79,306\nRaw materials and supplies 162,820 63,213\nWork in progress 71,074 -\nTotal inventory on hand $ 618,996 $ 142,519\nNOTE 6 DEPOSIT, PREPAYMENTS AND OTHER RECEIVABLES\nDeposit, prepayments, and other receivables consists of the following:\nSCHEDULE OF DEPOSIT PREPAYMENTS AND OTHER RECEIVABLES\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31,\nDeposits and Prepayment 61,270 15,208\nOther receivables (Advances from suppliers) 770,396 1,224,353\nTotal 831,666 1,239,561\n42 | Page\nNOTE 7 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET\nProperty, plant, and equipment consist of the following:\nSCHEDULE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31,\nPlant and machineries $ 464,019 $ -\nOffice equipment 55,587 46,375\nVehicles 71,860 58,247\nFurniture and equipment 26,577 23,864\nRenovation 134,309 62,551\nProperty plant and equipment gross 752,352 191,037\nLess: Accumulated depreciation (149,597 ) (54,439 )\nProperty, plant and equipment, net $ 602,755 $ 136,598\nDepreciation expense for the year ended August 31, 2021, was $25,414.

As a result of the Companys losses to date, there exists doubt as to the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a valuation allowance equal to the total deferred tax assets has been recorded.\nReconciliation between the statutory tax rate to income before income taxes and the actual provision for income taxes is as follows:\nSCHEDULE OF RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE STATUTORY TAX RATE AND THE ACTUAL PROVISION\nTwelve Months Ended\nAugust 31,\nUS Statutory rate 21 % 21 %\nEffect of reconciling items for tax purposes (21 )% (21 )%\nEffective income tax rate - % - %\n46 | Page\nThe components of net deferred tax assets are as follows:\nSCHEDULE OF COMPONENTS ON NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31,\nNet operating loss carry-forward $ 7,470,000 $ 2,230,000\nLess: valuation allowance (7,470,000 ) (2,230,000 )\nNet deferred tax asset - -\nThe Company had net operating loss carry forwards for tax purposes of approximately $7,470,000 at August 31, 2022, and approximately $2,230,000 at August 31, 2021, which may be available to offset future taxable income. Utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by Section 381 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carry forwards before utilization.\nNOTE 14 ROU ASSET AND LEASES\nA lease is defined as a contract that conveys the right to control the use of identifiable tangible property for a period of time in exchange for consideration. On February 28, 2022, the Company adopted ASC Topic 842 which primarily affected the accounting treatment for operating lease agreements in which the Company is the lessee including the Companys leases of office and factory. The Company elected to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities arising from short-term leases with initial lease terms of twelve months or less (deemed immaterial) on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nROU assets include any prepaid lease payments and exclude any lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on the effective interest, the effective amortization on the lease liability. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.\nWhen measuring lease liabilities for leases that were classified as operating leases as of August 31, 2022, the Company discounted lease payments using its estimated incremental borrowing rate of 10%.\nThe following is a summary of ROU asset and operating lease liabilities:\nSUMMARY OF ROU ASSET AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31,\nAssets:\nROU asset $ 442,020 $ -\nLiabilities:\nCurrent:\nOperating lease liabilities $ 117,686 $ -\nNon-current\nOperating lease liabilities 355,186 -\nTotal lease liabilities $ 472,872 $ -\nAs of August 31, 2022, remaining maturities of lease liabilities were as follows:\nSCHEDULE OF MATURITIES OF LEASE LIABILITIES\nOperating lease\n$ 117,686\n135,821\n112,235\n78,291\n2027 and thereafter 28,839\nTotal $ 472,872\n47 | Page\nNOTE 15 CONCENTRATIONS\nRevenues\nFor the years ended August 31, 2022, and 2021, the following customers comprised more than 10% of total sales:\nSCHEDULE OF CUSTOMERS COMPRISED OF TOTAL SALES\nFor the years\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31,\nCustomer #1 -* 25 %\nCustomer #2 -* 21 %\nCustomer #3 27 % -*\nCustomer #4 13 % -*\n* Accounted for less than 10% for the period\nAccounts receivable\nAs of the years ended August 31, 2022, and 2021, the following customers comprised more than 10% of total accounts receivable:\nSCHEDULE OF CUSTOMERS COMPRISE OF TOTAL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\nFor the year ended\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31,\nCustomer #5 19 % -*\nCustomer #1 -* 47 %\nCustomer #6 14 % -*\nCustomer #2 -* 17 %\nCustomer #7 12 % -*\n* Accounted for less than 10% for the year end\nPurchases\nFor the years ended August 31, 2022, and 2021, the following vendors comprised more than 10% of total purchases:\nSCHEDULE OF VENDORS COMPRISED OF TOTAL PURCHASES\nFor the years\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31,\nVendor #1 -* 45 %\nVendor #2 -* 35 %\nVendor #3 37 % -*\nVendor #4 18 % -*\nVendor #5 15 % -*\nVendor #6 15 % -*\n* Accounted for less than 10% for the period\nNOTE 16 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLitigation and Claims\nOn October 8, 2021, a filing (the Filing) was made with the Kuala Lumpur High Court by a reseller (the Reseller) of the Companys INCU ionic nano copper solution (the Solution) and the Resellers related party (together with the Reseller, the Plaintiffs).\nThe Reseller was authorized by WKL Eco Earths sole distributor of the Solution (the WKL Distributor) to resell the Solution together with a diffuser with a capacity of not more than 1000ml through a tripartite agreement (the Tripartite Agreement) entered into between (a) the Reseller, (b) the WKL Distributor and (c) a solution packaging company (the Packaging Company). WKL Eco Earth was not a party to the Tripartite Agreement and did not directly authorize or engage the Reseller in the resale of the Solution.\nIn the Filing, the Plaintiffs claimed against (i) WKL Eco Earth; (ii) Dr. Low; (iii) Chan Kok Wei, (iv) the Packaging Company and (v) two directors of the Packaging Company for loss and damages arising from an alleged breach of contract, defamation and tort of inducement. The Plaintiffs also alleged that pursuant to the Tripartite Agreement, WKL Eco Earth was prohibited from selling the Solution to any party other than the WKL Distributor and allow for the resale of the Solution by the Plaintiffs without limitation, and that the Plaintiffs were not confined in their resale of the Solution to a diffuser with a capacity of not more than 1000ml.\nThe Company believes the claims are without merit and will defend itself against the claims.\nThe Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies.
