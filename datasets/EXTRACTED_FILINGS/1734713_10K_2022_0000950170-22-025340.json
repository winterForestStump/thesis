    "content": "Item 1. Business\nBrightView Holdings, Inc. is a holding company that conducts substantially all of its activity through its direct, wholly-owned operating subsidiary, BrightView Landscapes, LLC (BrightView) and its consolidated subsidiaries. The holding company and BrightView are collectively referred to on Form 10-K (the Annual Report) as we, us, our, ourselves, Company, or BrightView. Prior to its initial public offering completed in July 2018 (the IPO), the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of BrightView Parent L.P. (Parent), an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. Inc. (KKR). The Parent and Company were formed through a series of transactions entered into by KKR to acquire the Company on December 18, 2013 (the KKR Acquisition). The Parent was dissolved in August 2018 following the IPO.\nOur Company\nWe are the largest provider of commercial landscaping services in the United States, with revenues approximately 6 times those of our next largest commercial landscaping competitor. We provide commercial landscaping services, ranging from landscape maintenance and enhancements to tree care and landscape development. We operate through a differentiated and integrated national service model which systematically delivers services at the local level by combining our network of over 290 branches with a qualified service partner network. Our branch delivery model underpins our position as a single-source end-to-end landscaping solution provider to our diverse customer base at the national, regional and local levels, which we believe represents a significant competitive advantage. We believe our commercial customer base understands the financial and reputational risk associated with inadequate landscape maintenance and considers our services to be essential and non-discretionary.\nWe operate through two segments: Maintenance Services and Development Services. Our maintenance services are primarily self-performed through our national branch network and are route-based in nature. Our development services are comprised of sophisticated design, coordination and installation of landscapes at some of the most recognizable corporate, athletic and university complexes and showcase highly visible work that is paramount to our customers perception of our brand as a market leader.\nAs the number one player in the highly attractive and growing $83 billion commercial landscape maintenance and snow removal market, we believe our size and scale present several compelling value propositions for our customers, and allow us to offer a single-source landscaping services solution to a diverse group of commercial customers across all 50 U.S. states. We serve a broad range of end market verticals, including corporate and commercial properties, Homeowners Associations (HOAs), public parks, hotels and resorts, hospitals and other healthcare facilities, educational institutions, restaurants and retail, and golf courses, among others. We are also the Official Field Consultant for Major League Baseball. Our diverse customer base includes approximately 9,500 office parks and corporate campuses, 7,500 residential communities, and 550 educational institutions. We believe that due to our unmatched geographic scale and breadth of service offerings, we are the only commercial landscaping services provider able to service clients whose geographically disperse locations require a broad range of landscaping services delivered consistently and with high quality. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 10% of our fiscal 2022 revenues, with no single customer accounting for more than 2% of our fiscal 2022 revenues.\nOur business model is characterized by stable, recurring revenues, a scalable operating model, strong operating margins, limited capital expenditures and low working capital requirements that together generate significant Free Cash Flow. For the year ended September 30, 2022, we generated net service revenues of $2,774.6 million, net income of $14.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $287.9 million, with a net income margin of 0.5% and an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.4%.\nOur Operating Segments\nWe deliver our broad range of services through two operating segments: Maintenance Services and Development Services. We serve a geographically diverse set of customers through our strategically located network of branches in 34 U.S. states and, through our qualified service partner network, we are able to efficiently provide nationwide coverage in all 50 U.S. states, as illustrated below.\nMaintenance Services Overview\nOur Maintenance Services segment delivers a full suite of recurring commercial landscaping services ranging from mowing, gardening, mulching and snow removal, to more horticulturally advanced services, such as water management, irrigation maintenance, tree care, golf course maintenance and specialty turf maintenance. Our maintenance services customers include Fortune 500 corporate campuses and commercial properties, HOAs, public parks, leading international hotels and resorts, airport authorities, municipalities, hospitals and other healthcare facilities, educational institutions, restaurants and retail, and golf courses, among others. The chart below illustrates the diversity of our Maintenance Services revenues:\n(1) Reflects the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nIn addition to contracted maintenance services, we also have a strong track record of providing value-added landscape enhancements, defined as supplemental, non-contract specified maintenance or improvement services which are typically sold by our account managers to our maintenance services customers. These landscape enhancements typically have a predictable level of demand related to our amount of contracted revenue with a customer.\nWe have a strong maintenance presence in both evergreen and seasonal markets. Evergreen markets are defined as those which require year-round landscape maintenance.\nIn our seasonal markets, we are also a leading provider of snow removal services. These route-based snow removal services provide us with a valuable counter-seasonal source of revenues, allowing us to better utilize our crews and certain equipment during the winter months. Our capabilities as a rapid-response, reliable service provider further strengthens our relationships with our customers, all of which have an immediate and critical need for snow removal services. Property managers also enjoy several benefits by using the same service provider for snow removal and landscape maintenance services, including consistency of service, single-source vendor efficiency and volume discount savings. This allows us to actively maintain relationships with key customers in seasonal markets year-round. A portion of our snow removal business is contracted each year under fixed fee servicing arrangements that are subject to guaranteed minimum payments regardless of the seasons snowfall.\nThe performance of our snow removal services business, however, is correlated with the amount of snowfall, the number of snowfall events and the nature of those events in a given season. We benchmark our performance against ten- and thirty-year averages, as annual snowfall amounts modulate around these figures.\n(1) Reflects cumulative annual snowfall at locations where BrightView has a presence.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, in Maintenance Services, we generated net service revenues of $2,082.0 million, including $256.3 million from snow removal services, and Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $278.8 million, with a Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 13.4%.\nDevelopment Services Overview\nThrough our Development Services segment, we provide landscape architecture and development services for new facilities and significant redesign projects. Specific services include project design and management services, landscape architecture, landscape installation, irrigation installation, tree moving and installation, pool and water features and sports field services, among others. These complex and specialized offerings showcase our technical expertise across a broad range of end market verticals.\nWe perform our services across the full spectrum of project sizes, with landscape development projects generally ranging from $100,000 to over $10 million, with an average size of approximately $1.2 million.\nDepending on the scope of the work, the contracts can vary in length from 2-3 months to up to 2-3 years. We largely self-perform our work, and we subcontract certain services where we have strategically decided not to allocate resources, such as fencing, lighting and parking lot construction. We believe that our capabilities as a single-source landscape development provider represent a point of comfort for our customers who can be certain that we are managing their landscape development project from inception to completion.\nIn our Development Services business, we are typically hired by general contractors with whom we maintain strong relationships as a result of our superior technical and project management capabilities. We believe the quality of our work is also well-regarded by our end-customers, some of whom directly request that their general contractors utilize our services when outsourcing their landscape development projects. Similar to our maintenance contracts, we leverage our proven cost estimation framework and proactive cost management tactics to optimize the profitability of the work we perform under fixed rate development contracts.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, in Development Services, we generated net service revenues of $698.8 million and Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $73.7 million, with a Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 10.5%.\nOur History\nIn 2013, affiliates of KKR acquired our predecessor business, Brickman Holding Group, Inc. In 2014, we acquired ValleyCrest Holding Co. (ValleyCrest Acquisition) and changed our name to BrightView. As a result of the ValleyCrest Acquisition, BrightView nearly doubled in size and gained national coverage. Our predecessor companies have long histories in the landscaping industry, with Brickman Holding Group, Inc. founded in 1939 and ValleyCrest Holding Co. founded in 1949.\nIn 2016, we reconstituted our senior leadership team, including hiring a new chief executive officer and a new chief financial officer. Our management team refocused our strategy to realign with the fundamental strengths of our business. BrightView has undergone an organizational transformation recentered around a branch-centric model, empowering leaders at the local and regional levels, and supporting branch locations with appropriate back office functions and an effective corporate framework.\nIn July 2018, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock (the IPO). Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BV. Our principal executive offices are located at 980 Jolly Road, Suite 300, Blue Bell, Pennsylvania 19422.\nMarket Opportunity\nCommercial Landscaping Services Industry\nThe landscape services industry consists of landscape maintenance and development services, as well as a number of related ancillary services such as tree care and snow removal, for both commercial and residential customers. BrightView operates only within the commercial sectors of each of the landscape maintenance, landscape development and snow removal industries. In 2021, commercial landscape maintenance, including snow removal, represented an $83 billion industry that is characterized by a number of attractive market drivers. The industry benefits from commercial customers need to provide consistently accessible and aesthetically-pleasing environments. Due to the essential and non-discretionary need of these recurring services, the commercial landscape maintenance services and snow removal services industries have exhibited, and are expected to continue to exhibit, stable and predictable growth.\nHighlighting the consistency of this growth, the combined industry is expected to grow at a 3.5% CAGR from 2017 through 2026, as depicted in the chart below:\n(1) Source: IBISWORLD-Landscaping Services in the U.S. (August 2021) IBISWorld-Snowplowing Services in the U.S. (April 2021). Presents commercial landscaping services and commercial snowplowing services as a share of the overall U.S. market at rates constant with IBISWorld figures for 2021.\nIn addition to its stable characteristics, the industry is also highly fragmented. Despite being the largest provider of commercial landscaping services, we currently hold only a 2.5% market share, representing a significant opportunity for future consolidation. According to the 2021 IBISWorld Report, there are over 600,000 enterprises providing landscape maintenance services in the United States. Approximately three-quarters of the industry participants are classified as sole proprietors, with a limited set of companies having the capabilities to deliver sophisticated, large-scale landscaping services or operate regionally or nationally. The chart below illustrates the segmentation of the landscape maintenance industry and highlights BrightViews coverage of the non-residential sectors of the industry:\n(1)Source: IBISWorld-Landscaping Services in the U.S. (August 2021)\n(2)Source: IBISWorld-Snowplowing Services in the U.S. (April 2021)\nSteady growth in the commercial property markets has underpinned the commercial landscaping industrys growth. Unlike individual residential customers, HOAs and military housing managers possess the same sophistication and expectation of high-quality services as corporations, and thus are more inclined to outsource landscaping needs to professional, scaled companies.\nKey Trends and Industry Drivers\nWe believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on the following key industry trends that are expected to drive stable and growing demand for our landscaping services:\nOutsourcing. To reduce expenditures and increase operational flexibility, businesses, institutions and governments are increasingly outsourcing non-core processes, such as landscape maintenance.\nSole-Sourcing. An increasing number of businesses have made an effort to lower costs and improve quality through a reduction in the number of suppliers or service vendors they hire. Companies have begun to award sole-source contracts to full-service vendors who are able to meet expanded requirements.\nEnhanced Quality Demands. Customers are increasingly raising their expectations regarding the quality of the work performed by their landscape maintenance providers and on the variety of services offered. As demands continue to rise, market share will accrue to those providers who have the expertise, quality of service and institutional procedures to meet these enhanced expectations.\nIncreased Focus on Corporate Campus Environments. Corporations have increasingly invested in creating a unique and welcoming atmosphere for employees, clients and tenants by enhancing their corporate campus environments. Irrespective of whether a headquarters or corporate campus is located in an urban area or suburban area, we believe that companies are increasingly viewing their exterior landscaping as a competitive differentiator and are making significant investments to create visually appealing outdoor spaces.\nGrowth of Private Non-residential Construction. Over the next five years, the overall U.S. landscape maintenance industry is projected to be supported by rising construction and economic activity. According to the 2021 IBISWorld Report, private non-residential construction is forecasted to grow at an annualized rate of 3.6% over the five years leading to 2026. We believe growth in commercial construction promotes growth in commercial landscape maintenance and development services.\nOrganization\nOur core operating strategy is to systematically deliver our services on a local level. Our organization is designed to allow our branch-level management teams to focus on identifying revenue opportunities and delivering high quality services to customers, with the support of a national organization to provide centralized core functions, such as human resources, procurement and other process-driven management functions.\nOur maintenance services model is grounded in our branch network. For example, a representative maintenance services branch typically serves 25-100 customers across 50-200 sites, generating between $5 million and $15 million in annual revenues. Each branch is led by a branch manager, who focuses on performance drivers, such as customer satisfaction, crew retention, safety and tactical procurement. Branch managers are supported by production managers, who focus on managing crew leaders, and account managers, who focus on customer retention and sales of landscape enhancement services. In addition to our network of branch managers, production managers and account managers, our platform is differentiated by a highly experienced team of operational senior vice presidents and vice presidents, organized regionally, with an average tenure of 14 years. These team members are responsible for leading, teaching and developing branch managers as well as maintaining adherence to key operational strategies. Our senior operating personnel also foster a culture of engagement and emphasize promotion from within, which has played a key role in making BrightView the employer of choice within the broader landscape maintenance industry.\nOur scale supports centralizing key functions, which enables our branch, production and account managers to focus their efforts on fostering deep relationships with customers, delivering excellent service and finding new revenue opportunities. As branches grow and we win new business, our branch model is easily scalable within an existing, well-developed market-based management structure with supporting corporate infrastructure.\nWe supplement our branch network with our qualified service partner network, which is managed by our BrightView Enterprise Solutions team, or BES. Through our BES platform, we are able to provide landscape maintenance services in all 50 U.S. states. BES identifies qualified service providers in areas where we do not have branches, thereby extending our service area. Our qualified service partner screening process is designed to ensure that each of our service partners has the appropriate technical expertise, equipment and resources, including insurance coverage, to support the projects we assign to them.\nOur Development Services organization is centered around 40 branch locations strategically located in large metropolitan areas with supportive demographics for growth and real estate development. Certain facilities used by our Development Services segment are shared or co-located with our Maintenance organization. Our Development Services branch network is supported by two design centers, as well as centralized support functions similar to our Maintenance Services organization.\nHuman Capital\nEmployees\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had a total of approximately 21,000 employees, including seasonal workers, consisting of approximately 20,300 full-time and approximately 700 part-time employees in our two business segments. The number of part-time employees varies significantly from time to time during the year due to seasonal and other operating requirements. We generally experience our highest level of employment during the spring and summer seasons, which correspond with our third and fourth fiscal quarters. The approximate number of full-time employees by segment, as of September 30, 2022, is as follows: Maintenance Services: 17,300; Development Services: 2,700. In addition, our corporate staff is approximately 300 employees. Approximately 4% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any material interruptions of operations due to disputes with our employees and consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. Historically, we have used, and expect to continue to use in the future, a U.S. government program that provides H-2B temporary, non-immigrant visas to foreign workers to help satisfy a portion of our need for seasonal labor in certain markets. We employed approximately 2,100 seasonal workers in 2022, and 2021, through the H-2B visa program.\nSafety\nWe care about our employees and we believe that our commercial success is linked to a safe and healthy workforce. We strive for zero injuries and an incident-free workplace and have achieved significant progress towards this goal through risk reduction activities, including robust training, jobsite safety observations and pre-job safety briefings to raise awareness around workplace hazards and reduce employee exposure to hazardous conditions. Our care and concern for employee wellbeing is enhanced by the BrightView Landscapes Foundation, a nonprofit organization used to support employees during periods of personal and financial stress. BrightView continues to demonstrate our commitment to preventing the spread of COVID-19 by continuing to adhere to the CDC guidelines and meet or exceed local government mandates.\nTotal Rewards\nOur total rewards philosophy is designed to offer compensation and benefits programs that enable us to attract, motivate, reward and retain high-caliber employees who are capable of creating and sustaining value for our stockholders over the long-term and to design programs that are fair and competitive in order to appropriately reward employees for their contributions to our success. Our programs are structured to meet the diverse needs of our employees and their families. Among other things, we offer comprehensive health and wellness plans, retirement savings plans, and the opportunity to earn short-term and long-term incentive awards to eligible employees.\nTraining\nWe are committed to developing and unlocking the potential of our people and we make significant investments in training and professional development. BrightView University, our learning and development platform, underpins the development of leadership and professional skills.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe are committed to creating and sustaining a diverse workplace that understands and values individual differences across demographics, experiences and perspectives. We want to ensure that collaborative and respectful business practices in a performance-based, supportive environment enable every employee to realize his/her/their career ambitions.\nCompetition\nAlthough the United States landscaping, snow removal and landscape design and development industries have experienced some consolidation, there is significant competition in all the areas that we serve, and such competition varies across geographies. In our Maintenance Services segment, most competitors are smaller local and regional firms; however, we also face competition from other large national firms such as Yellowstone Landscape, Bartlett Tree Experts and HeartLand. In our Development Services segment, competitors are generally smaller local and regional firms. We believe that the primary competitive factors that affect our operations are quality, service, experience, breadth of service offerings and price. We believe that our ability to compete effectively is enhanced by the breadth of our services and the technological tools used by our teams as well as our nationwide reach.\nSeasonality\nOur services, particularly in our Maintenance Services segment, have seasonal variability such as increased mulching, flower planting and intensive mowing in the spring, leaf removal and cleanup work in the fall, snow removal services in the winter and potentially minimal mowing during drier summer months. This can drive fluctuations in revenue, costs and cash flows for interim periods.\nWe have a significant presence in our evergreen markets, which require landscape maintenance services year round. In our seasonal markets, which do not have a year-round growing season, the demand for our landscape maintenance services decreases during the winter months. Typically, our revenues and net income have been higher in the spring and summer seasons, which correspond with our third and fourth fiscal quarters. The lower level of activity in seasonal markets during our first and second fiscal quarters is partially offset by revenue from our snow removal services. Such seasonality causes our results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter.\nWeather Conditions\nWeather may impact the timing of performance of landscape maintenance and enhancement services and progress on development projects from quarter to quarter. Less predictable weather patterns, including snow events in the winter, hurricane-related cleanup in the summer and fall, and the effects of abnormally high rainfall or drought in a given market, can impact both our revenues and our costs, especially from quarter to quarter, but also from year to year in some cases. Extreme weather events such as hurricanes and tropical storms can result in a positive impact to our business in the form of increased enhancement services revenues related to cleanup and other services. However, such weather events may also negatively impact our ability to deliver our contracted services, sell and deliver enhancement services or impact the timing of performance.\nIn our seasonal markets, the performance of our snow removal services is correlated with the amount of snowfall, the number of snowfall events and the nature of those events in a given season. We benchmark our performance against ten- and thirty-year averages.\nIntellectual Property\nWe, primarily through our subsidiaries, hold or have rights to use various service marks, trademarks and trade names we use in the operation of our businesses that we deem particularly important to each of our businesses. As of September 30, 2022, we had marks that were protected by registration (either by direct registration or by treaty) in the United States.\nRegulatory Overview\nWe are required to comply with various federal, state and local laws and regulations, which increases our operating costs, limits or restricts the services provided by our operating segments or the methods by which our operating segments offer, sell and fulfill those services or conduct their respective businesses, or subjects us to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations can subject us to fines or various forms of civil or criminal prosecution, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThese federal, state and local laws and regulations include laws relating to wage and hour, immigration, permitting and licensing, workers safety, tax, healthcare reforms, collective bargaining and other labor matters, environmental, federal motor carrier safety, employee benefits and privacy and customer data security. We must also meet certain requirements of federal and state transportation agencies, including requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportation and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, with respect to certain types of vehicles in our fleets. We are also regulated by federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations which are enforced by Departments of Agriculture, environmental regulatory agencies and similar government entities.\nEmployee and Immigration Matters\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees, including regulations relating to wage and hour, health insurance, working conditions, safety, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance and workers compensation, anti-discrimination, collective bargaining and other labor matters.\nWe are also subject to the regulations of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and we are audited from time to time by ICE for compliance with work authorization requirements. In addition, some states in which we operate have adopted immigration employment protection laws. Even if we operate in strict compliance with ICE and state requirements, some of our employees may not meet federal work eligibility or residency requirements, despite our efforts and without our knowledge, which could lead to a disruption in our work force.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding environmental, health and safety matters, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Oil Pollution Act and the Clean Water Act, each as amended. Among other things, these laws and regulations regulate the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, govern the use, storage, treatment, disposal, handling and management of hazardous substances and wastes and the registration, use, notification and labeling of pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers, and protect the health and safety of our employees. These laws also impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from, present and past releases of hazardous substances, including releases by us or prior owners or operators, at sites we currently own, lease or operate, customer sites or third-party sites to which we sent wastes. During fiscal 2021, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.\nInformation Technology\nWe have invested in technology designed to accelerate business performance, enhancing our ability to support standard processes while retaining local and regional flexibility. We believe these investments position BrightView at the forefront of technology within the commercial landscaping industry, enabling us to drive operational efficiencies throughout the business. Our IT systems allow us to provide a high level of convenience and service to our customers, representing a competitive advantage that is difficult to replicate for less technologically sophisticated competitors.\nAs an example, our proprietary, BrightView Connect application allows customers to submit service requests and landscape pictures directly to their account manager and field team, ensuring that specific service needs are accurately delivered in a timely and efficient manner. Similarly, our mobile quality site assessment application, which is designed for account managers to capture and annotate customer feedback, provides us with the ability to walk the site with our customers, confirm our understanding of their needs\nand highlight future enhancement opportunities. These solutions are components of our integrated Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system for account managers in the Maintenance Services segment. Among other benefits, the CRM system is accessible on mobile devices and enables account managers to spend more time with their customers, enhancing the quality of those relationships and supporting long-term customer retention.\nWe have also made significant investments in our internal IT infrastructure, such as migrating to a consolidated enterprise resource planning system and enabling shared services for accounts payable, accounts receivable and payroll. Additionally, we have implemented an electronic time capture system, or ETC, for our crew leaders and supervisors in the field. ETC not only provides accurate information for compliance and payroll purposes, but also enables our leadership with granular, analytical insights into job costing and crew productivity.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing efforts are focused on both developing new customers and increasing penetration at existing customers. We primarily sell our services to businesses, commercial property managers, general contractors and landscape architects through our professionally trained core sales force. We have a field-based sales approach driven by our growing team of more than 210 business developers that are focused on winning new customers at a local level. We also have a separate 24-member sales team that is focused on targeting and capturing high-value, high-margin opportunities, including national accounts. Within our Maintenance Services segment, every customer relationship is maintained by one of our more than 700+ branch-level account managers, who are responsible for ensuring customer satisfaction, tracking service levels, promoting enhancement services and driving contract renewals. We believe our decentralized approach to customer acquisition and management facilitates a high-level of customer service as local managers are empowered and incentivized to better serve customers and grow their respective businesses.\nOur marketing department is also integral to our strategy and helps drive business growth, retention and brand awareness through marketing and communications efforts, including promotional materials, marketing programs, and advertising; digital marketing, including search engine optimization and website development; and trade shows and company-wide public relations activities. Our field marketing teams focus at the branch level to make our corporate marketing strategies more localized. Given the local nature of our operations, we believe that a sizeable amount of our new sales are also driven by customer referrals which stem from our strong reputation, depth of customer relationships and quality of work.\nFleet\nOur highly visible fleet of approximately 16,000 trucks and trailers foster the strong brand equity associated with BrightView. We manage our fleet with a dedicated centralized team, as well as regional equipment managers, who together focus on compliance, maintenance, asset utilization and procurement. We believe we have the largest fleet of vehicles in the commercial landscape maintenance industry.\nSourcing and Suppliers\nOur size and broad national network make us an attractive partner for many industry-leading manufacturers and suppliers, which has allowed us to maintain strong, long-term relationships with our supply base.\nWe source our equipment, supplies and other related materials and products from a range of suppliers, including landscaping equipment companies, suppliers of fertilizer, seed, chemicals and other agricultural products, irrigation equipment manufacturers, and a variety of suppliers who specialize in nursery goods, outdoor lighting, hardscapes and other landscaping products.\nWe generally procure our products through purchase orders rather than under long-term contracts with firm commitments. We work to develop strong relationships with a select group of suppliers that we target based on a number of factors, including brand and market recognition, price, quality, product support and service, service levels, delivery terms and their strategic positioning.\nWhere You Can Find More Information\nWe file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our SEC filings are available to the public over the internet at the SECs website at https://www.sec.gov. Our SEC filings are also available on our website at https://www.brightview.com as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the SEC.\nFrom time to time, we may use our website as a distribution channel of material company information. Financial and other important information regarding our company is routinely accessible through and posted on our website at https://investor.brightview.com. In addition, you may automatically receive email alerts and other information about us when you enroll your email address by visiting the Email Alerts section at https://investor.brightview.com. Our website and the information contained on or connected to that site are not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information included in this Form 10-K, including Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The selected risks described below, however, are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business is affected by general business, financial market and economic conditions, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business and results of operations are significantly affected by general business, financial market and economic conditions. General business, financial market and economic conditions that could impact the level of activity in the commercial landscape services industry include the level of commercial construction activity, the condition of the real estate markets where we operate, interest rate fluctuations, inflation, unemployment and wage levels, changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal and tax policies including change in tax rates, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions, capital spending, bankruptcies, volatility in both the debt and equity capital markets, liquidity of the global financial markets, the availability and cost of credit, investor and consumer confidence, global economic growth, local, state and federal government regulation, the cost and availability of our supplies and equipment and the strength of regional and local economies in which we operate. New or increased tariffs may impact the costs of some of our supplies and equipment. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed and timing of the tariffs. These factors could also negatively impact the timing or the ultimate collection of accounts receivable, which would adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nDuring an economic downturn, our customers may decrease their spending on landscape services by seeking to reduce expenditures for landscape services, in particular enhancement services, engaging a lower cost service provider or performing landscape maintenance themselves rather than outsourcing to third parties like us or generally reducing the size and complexity of their new landscaping development projects.\nRecent increases in raw material costs, fuel prices, wages and other operating costs, and changes in our ability to source adequate supplies and materials in a timely manner, have adversely impacted our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur financial performance has been adversely affected by increases in our operating expenses, including fuel, fertilizer, chemicals, road salt, mulch, wages and salaries, employee benefits, health care, subcontractor costs, vehicle, facilities and equipment leases, insurance and regulatory compliance costs, all of which are subject to historic continuing inflationary pressures. While we seek to manage price and availability risks related to raw materials, such as fuel, fertilizer, chemicals, road salt and mulch, through procurement strategies, these efforts may not be successful and we may experience adverse impacts due to the rising prices of such products. In addition, we closely monitor wage, salary and benefit costs in an effort to remain competitive in our markets. Attracting and maintaining a high quality workforce is a priority for our business, and as wage, salary or benefit costs increase, including as a result of minimum wage legislation, our operating costs will continue to increase. We cannot predict the extent to which we may experience future increases in operating expenses as well as various regulatory compliance costs. To the extent such costs continue to increase, we may be prevented, in whole or in part, from passing these cost increases through to our existing and prospective customers, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to offer a wide variety of services to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate supplies, materials and products from manufacturers, distributors and other suppliers. Any disruption or shortage in our sources of supply due to unanticipated increased demand or disruptions in production or delivery of products such as fertilizer, chemicals, road salt and mulch, could result in a loss of revenues, reduced margins and damage to our relationships with customers. In addition, we source certain materials and products we use in our business from a limited number of suppliers. If our suppliers experience difficulties or disruptions in their operations or if we lose any significant supplier, we may experience increased supply costs or may experience delays in establishing replacement supply sources that meet our quality and control standards. The loss of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of, supplies and products from our suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur industry and the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and increased competitive pressures could reduce our share of the markets we serve and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in markets with relatively few large competitors, but barriers to entry in the landscape services industry are generally low, which has led to highly competitive markets consisting of entities ranging from small or local operators to large regional businesses, as well as potential customers that choose not to outsource their landscape maintenance services. Any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do, provide superior service, have the ability to deliver similar services at a lower cost, develop stronger relationships with our customers and other consumers in the landscape services industry, adapt more quickly\nto evolving customer requirements, devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their services or access financing on more favorable terms than we can obtain. In addition, while regional competitors may be smaller than we are, some of these businesses may have a greater presence than we do in a particular market. As a result of any of these factors, we may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur customers consider the quality and differentiation of the services we provide, our customer service and price when deciding whether to use our services. As we have worked to establish ourselves as leading, high-quality providers of landscape maintenance and development services, we compete predominantly on the basis of high levels of service and strong relationships. We may not be able to, or may choose not to, compete with certain competitors on the basis of price and accordingly, some of our customers may switch to lower cost services providers or perform such services themselves. If we are unable to compete effectively with our existing competitors or new competitors enter the markets in which we operate, or our current customers stop outsourcing their landscape maintenance services, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, our former employees may start landscape services businesses similar to ours and compete directly with us. While we customarily sign non-competition agreements, which typically continue for one year following the termination of employment, with certain of our employees, such agreements do not fully protect us against competition from former employees and may not be enforceable depending on local law and the surrounding circumstances. Consequently, we cannot predict with certainty whether, if challenged, a court will enforce any particular non-competition agreement. Any increased competition from businesses started by former employees may reduce our market share and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business success depends on our ability to preserve long-term customer relationships.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain our current customers, renew our existing customer contracts and obtain new business. Our ability to do so generally depends on a variety of factors, including the quality, price and responsiveness of our services, as well as our ability to market these services effectively and differentiate ourselves from our competitors. We largely seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors on the basis of high levels of service, breadth of service offerings and strong relationships and may not be able to, or may choose not to, compete with certain competitors on the basis of price. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain new business, renew existing customer contracts at the same or higher levels of pricing or that our current customers will not cease operations, elect to self-operate or terminate contracts with us. In our Maintenance Services segment, we primarily provide services pursuant to agreements that are cancelable by either party upon 30-days notice. Consequently, our customers can unilaterally terminate all services pursuant to the terms of our service agreements, without penalty.\nWe may be adversely affected if customers reduce their outsourcing.\nOur business and growth strategies benefit from the continuation of a current trend toward outsourcing services. Customers will outsource if they perceive that outsourcing may provide quality services at a lower overall cost and permit them to focus on their core business activities. We cannot be certain that this trend will continue or that customers that have outsourced functions will not decide to perform these functions themselves. If a significant number of our existing customers reduced their outsourcing and elected to perform the services themselves, such loss of customers could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause we operate our business through dispersed locations across the United States, our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent practices and the operating results of individual branches may vary.\nWe operate our business through a network of dispersed locations throughout the United States, supported by corporate executives and certain centralized services in our headquarters, with local branch management retaining responsibility for day-to-day operations. Our operating structure could make it difficult for us to coordinate procedures across our operations in a timely manner or at all, and certain of our branches may require significant oversight and coordination from headquarters to support their growth. In addition, the operating results of an individual branch may differ from that of another branch for a variety of reasons, including market size, management practices, competitive landscape, regulatory requirements and local economic conditions. Inconsistent or incomplete implementation of corporate strategy and policies at the local level could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not successfully implement our business strategies, including achieving our growth objectives.\nWe may not be able to fully implement our business strategies or realize, in whole or in part within the expected time frames, the anticipated benefits of our various growth or other initiatives. Our various business strategies and initiatives, including our growth, operational and management initiatives, are subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. The execution of our business strategy and our financial performance will continue to depend in significant part on our executive management team and other key management personnel, our ability to identify and complete suitable acquisitions and our executive management teams ability to execute new operational initiatives. In addition, we may incur certain costs as we pursue our growth, operational and management initiatives, and we may not meet anticipated implementation timetables or stay within budgeted costs. As these initiatives are undertaken, we may not fully achieve our expected efficiency improvements or growth rates, or these initiatives could adversely impact our customer retention, supplier relationships or operations. Also, our business strategies may change\nfrom time to time in light of our ability to implement our business initiatives, competitive pressures, economic uncertainties or developments, or other factors.\nFuture acquisitions or other strategic transactions could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have acquired businesses in the past and expect to continue to acquire businesses or assets in the future. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and complete suitable acquisitions. For example, due to the highly fragmented nature of our industry, it may be difficult for us to identify potential targets with revenues sufficient to justify taking on the risks associated with pursuing their acquisition. The failure to identify suitable acquisitions and successfully integrate these acquired businesses may limit our ability to expand our operations and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, acquired businesses may not perform in accordance with expectations, and our business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of acquired businesses may not prove to be correct. We may also be unable to achieve expected improvements or achievements in businesses that we acquire. The process of integrating an acquired business may create unforeseen difficulties and expenses, including the diversion of resources away from our operations; the inability to retain employees, customers and suppliers; difficulties implementing our strategy at the acquired business; the assumption of actual or contingent liabilities (including those relating to the environment); failure to effectively and timely adopt and adhere to our internal control processes, accounting systems and other policies; write-offs or impairment charges relating to goodwill and other intangible assets; unanticipated liabilities relating to acquired businesses; and potential expenses associated with litigation with sellers of such businesses.\nIf management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits and revenue opportunities resulting from acquisitions and our business could suffer. Although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will discover or adequately protect against all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator.\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we generally require that key management and former principals of the businesses we acquire enter into non-competition agreements in our favor. Enforceability of these non-competition agreements varies from state to state, and may depend on the relevant facts and circumstances. Consequently, we cannot predict with certainty whether, if challenged, a court will enforce any particular non-competition agreement. Increased competition could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nSeasonality affects the demand for our services and our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe demand for our services and our results of operations are affected by the seasonal nature of our landscape maintenance services in certain regions. In geographies that do not have a year-round growing season, the demand for our landscape maintenance services decreases during the winter months. Typically, our revenues and net income have been higher in the spring and summer seasons, which correspond with our third and fourth fiscal quarters. The lower level of activity in seasonal markets during our first and second fiscal quarters is partially offset by revenue from our snow removal services. In our Development Services segment, we typically experience lower activity levels during the winter months. Such seasonality causes our results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter. Due to the seasonal nature of the services we provide, we also experience seasonality in our employment and working capital needs. Our employment and working capital needs generally correspond with the increased demand for our services in the spring and summer months and employment levels and operating costs are generally at their highest during such months. Consequently, our results of operations and financial position can vary from year-to-year, as well as from quarter-to-quarter. If we are unable to effectively manage the seasonality and year-to-year variability, our results of operations, financial position and cash flow may be adversely affected.\nOur operations are impacted by weather conditions and climate change.\nWe perform landscape services, the demand for which is affected by weather conditions, including impacts from climate change, droughts, severe storms and significant rain or snowfall, all of which may impact the timing and frequency of the performance of our services, or our ability to perform the services at all. For example, severe weather conditions, such as excessive heat or cold, may result in maintenance services being omitted for part of a season or beginning or ending earlier than anticipated, which could result in lost revenues or require additional services to be performed for which we may not receive corresponding incremental revenues. Variability in the frequency of which we must perform our services can affect the margins we realize on a given contract.\nCertain extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and tropical storms, can result in increased enhancement revenues related to cleanup and other services. However, such weather events may also impact our ability to deliver our contracted services or cause damage to our facilities or equipment. These weather events can also result in higher fuel costs, higher labor costs and shortages of raw materials and products. As a result, a perceived earnings benefits related to extreme weather events may be moderated. Droughts could cause shortage in the water supply and governments may impose limitations on water usage, which may change customer demand for landscape maintenance and irrigation services. There is a risk that demand for our services will change in ways that we are unable to predict.\nClimate change may increase in the frequency, duration and severity of extreme weather events and make weather patterns change or more difficult to predict. Such changes may impede our ability to provide services or make it difficult for us to anticipate customer\ndemand. We have made certain commitments to mitigate against climate change, but it may take us longer than expected to meet these commitments, or we may not meet them at all.\nThe continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ongoing effects of the public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to mitigate the health impact of the pandemic have profoundly and adversely affected economic activity. In addition to past limitations on our operations as a result of governmental orders or restrictions, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and may continue to cause, disruptions to our business and operations as a result of any social distancing measures, restrictions on or consumer reluctance to travel and labor shortages as a result of illness and possible delays in H2-B visa processing in connection with government orders and regulations related to immigration. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused and may continue to cause disruptions in the business and operations of the general contractors with which we work and our suppliers. We may be unable to timely obtain the supplies we need to provide our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our ability to operate our business. As a result, we may lose business opportunities, have reduced revenues or have difficulty collecting payments from clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in reduced demand for our ancillary services which has, as a result, led to a decline in ancillary revenues.\nIn addition to the risks specifically described above, the continuing impact of COVID-19 is likely to implicate and exacerbate certain risks, including those related to our customers, demand for our services, reliance on workers, suppliers, our indebtedness, and potential additional impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nIf we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs when we bid on or negotiate contracts that are ultimately awarded to us, we may achieve lower than anticipated profits or incur contract losses.\nA significant portion of our contracts are subject to competitive bidding and/or are negotiated on a fixed- or capped-fee basis for the services covered. Such contracts generally require that the total amount of work, or a specified portion thereof, be performed for a single price irrespective of our actual costs. If our cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if we do not execute the contract within our cost estimates, then cost overruns may cause the contract not to be as profitable as we expected or could cause us to incur losses.\nOur landscape development services have been, and in the future may be, adversely impacted by fluctuations or declines in the new commercial construction sector, as well as in spending on repair and upgrade activities. Such variability in this part of our business could result in lower revenues and reduced cash flows and profitability.\nWith respect to our Development Services segment, a significant portion of our revenues are derived from development activities associated with new commercial real estate development, including hospitality and leisure, which has experienced periodic declines, some of which have been severe, including recent and sustained declines associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The strength of these markets depends on, among other things, housing starts, local occupancy rates, demand for commercial space, non-residential construction spending activity, business investment and general economic conditions, which are a function of many factors beyond our control, including interest rates, employment levels, availability of credit, consumer spending, consumer confidence and capital spending. During a downturn in the commercial real estate development industry, customers may decrease their spending on landscape development services by generally reducing the size and complexity of their new landscaping development projects. Additionally, when interest rates rise, there may be a decrease in the spending activities of our current and potential Development Services customers. Fluctuations in commercial real estate development markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur results of operations for our snow removal services depend primarily on the level, timing and location of snowfall. As a result, a decline in frequency or total amounts of snowfall in multiple regions for an extended time could cause our results of operations to decline and adversely affect our ability to generate cash flow.\nAs a provider of snow removal services, our revenues are impacted by the frequency, amount, timing and location of snowfall in the regions in which we offer our services. A high number of snowfalls in a given season generally has a positive effect on the results of our operations. However, snowfall in the months of March, April, October and/or November could have a potentially adverse effect on ordinary course maintenance landscape services typically performed during those periods. A low level or lack of snowfall in any given year in any of the snow-belt regions in North America (primarily the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions of the United States) or a sustained period of reduced snowfall events in one or more of the geographic regions in which we operate will likely cause revenues from our snow removal services to decline in such year, which in turn may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and cash flow. In the past ten- and thirty-year periods, the regions that we service have averaged 3,865.0 inches and 3,755.0 inches of annual snowfall, respectively. However, there can be no assurance that these regions will receive seasonal snowfalls near their historical average in the future. Variability in the frequency and timing of snowfalls creates challenges associated with budgeting and forecasting for the Maintenance Services segment. Additionally, the effects of climate change may impact the frequency and total amounts of future snowfall, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur success depends on our executive management and other key personnel.\nOur future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our executive management and other key personnel and their ability to provide us with uninterrupted leadership and direction. The failure to retain our executive officers and other key personnel or a failure to provide adequate succession plans could have an adverse impact. The availability of highly qualified talent is limited, and the competition for talent is robust. A failure to efficiently or effectively replace executive management members or other key personnel and to attract, retain and develop new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations and implementation of our strategic plan.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and maintain positive relations with workers.\nOur future success and financial performance depend substantially on our ability to attract, train and retain hourly and field workers, as well as trained workers, including account, branch and regional management personnel. The landscape services industry is labor intensive, and industry participants, including us, experience high turnover rates among hourly workers and competition for qualified supervisory personnel. In addition, we, like many landscape service providers who conduct a portion of their operations in seasonal climates, employ a portion of our field personnel for only part of the year. In addition, general labor shortages, a high turnover rate and difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified employees at any level of our organization could result in delays in our services.\nThe competition for talent and labor in general is currently extremely high. In this competitive environment, our business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, which may include increases in wages and benefits necessary to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets, increases triggered by regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling and benefits; increases in health care and workers compensation insurance costs; and increases in benefits and costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its resurgence. In light of the current challenging labor market conditions, our wages and benefits programs and any steps we take to increase our wages and benefits, may be insufficient to attract and retain talent at all levels of our organization. Any increase in labor costs due to minimum wage laws or customer requirements about scheduling and overtime that we are unable to pass on to our customers could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Existing labor shortages, and our inability to attract employees to maintain a qualified workforce, could adversely affect our production and our overall business and financial performance.\nWe have historically relied on the H-2B visa program to bring workers to the United States on a seasonal basis. We employed approximately 2,100 seasonal workers in 2022 and 2021 through the H-2B visa program. If we are unable to hire sufficient numbers of seasonal workers, through the H-2B program or otherwise, we may experience a labor shortage. In the event of a labor shortage, whether related to seasonal or permanent staff, we could experience difficulty in delivering our services in a high-quality or timely manner and could experience increased recruiting, training and wage costs in order to attract and retain employees, which would result in higher operating costs and reduced profitability.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 21,000 employees, approximately 4% of which are represented by a union pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. If a significant number of our employees were to attempt to unionize, and/or successfully unionized, including in the wake of any future legislation that makes it easier for employees to unionize, our business could be negatively affected. Any inability by us to negotiate collective bargaining arrangements could result in strikes or other work stoppages disrupting our operations, and new union contracts could increase operating and labor costs. If these labor organizing activities were successful, it could further increase labor costs, decrease operating efficiency and productivity in the future, or otherwise disrupt or negatively impact our operations. Moreover, certain of the collective bargaining agreements we participate in require periodic contributions to multiemployer defined benefit pension plans. Our required contributions to these plans could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, the inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, low interest rates, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. Additionally, in the event we were to withdraw from some or all of these plans as a result of our exiting certain markets or otherwise, and the relevant plans are underfunded, we may become subject to a withdrawal liability. The amount of these required contributions may be material.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a failure to properly verify the employment eligibility of our employees.\nWe use the U.S. governments E-Verify program to verify employment eligibility for all new employees throughout our company. However, use of E-Verify does not guarantee that we will successfully identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Although we use E-Verify and require all new employees to provide us with government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. The employment of unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties, and adverse publicity that negatively impacts our reputation and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. We are subject to regulations of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, and we are audited from time to time by ICE for compliance with work authentication requirements. While we believe we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, if we are found not to be in compliance as a result of any audits, we may be subject to fines or other remedial actions. See Business-Regulatory Overview-Employee and Immigration Matters.\nTermination of a significant number of employees in specific markets or across our company due to work authorization or other regulatory issues would disrupt our operations, and could also cause adverse publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws. Our reputation and financial performance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors. Furthermore, immigration laws have been an area of considerable political focus in recent years, and the U.S. Congress and the Executive Branch of the U.S. government from time to time consider or implement changes to federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs. Further changes in immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and potential liability and make our hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees.\nOur use of subcontractors to perform work under certain customer contracts exposes us to liability and financial risk.\nIn our Development Services segment and through our qualified service partner network in our Maintenance Services segment, we use subcontractors to perform work in situations in which we are not able to self-perform such work. If we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors, our ability to successfully complete a project or perform services could be impaired. If we are not able to locate qualified third-party subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors exceeds what we have estimated, we could incur losses or realize lower than expected margins. We may not have direct control over our subcontractors, and although we have in place controls and programs to monitor the work of our subcontractors, there can be no assurance that these programs will have the desired effect. The actual or alleged failure to perform or negligence of a subcontractor may damage our reputation or expose us to liability, which could impact our results of operations. Furthermore, if our subcontractors are unable to cover the cost of damages or physical injuries caused by their actions, whether through insurance or otherwise, we may be held liable for such costs.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets, the value of which may be reduced if we determine that additional assets are impaired.\nOn December 18, 2013, an affiliate of KKR indirectly acquired a controlling interest in our company and on June 30, 2014, we acquired ValleyCrest Holding Co. As a result of the KKR and ValleyCrest acquisitions, we applied the acquisition method of accounting. Since 2017, we have completed an additional 36 acquisitions. Accounting for these transactions has involved various amounts of goodwill. Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest. Intangible assets, including goodwill, are assigned to our segments based upon their fair value at the time of acquisition. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. As of September 30, 2022, the net carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets, net, represented $2,183.1 million, or 66.0% of our total assets. A future impairment, if any, could have a material adverse effect to our financial position or results of operations. See Note 7 Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Acquisitions to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information related to impairment testing for goodwill and other intangible assets and the associated charges taken.\nIf we fail to comply with requirements imposed by applicable law or other governmental regulations, we could become subject to lawsuits, investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state, and local levels in many areas of our business, such as employment laws, wage and hour laws, discrimination laws, immigration laws, human health and safety laws, transportation laws, environmental laws, false claims or whistleblower statutes, disadvantaged business enterprise statutes, tax codes, antitrust and competition laws, intellectual property laws, governmentally funded entitlement programs and cost and accounting principles, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, other anti-corruption laws, lobbying laws, motor carrier safety laws and data privacy and security laws. We may be subject to review, audit or inquiry by applicable regulators from time to time.\nWhile we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws, regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those referred to above, we may be subject to investigations, criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, penalties, damages, reimbursement, injunctions, seizures or disgorgements of the ability to operate our motor vehicles. The cost of compliance or the consequences of non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, government agencies may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require either the corporation as a whole or individual businesses to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations.\nCompliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including laws pertaining to the use of pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers, or liabilities thereunder, as well as the risk of potential litigation, could result in significant costs that adversely impact our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental, health and safety matters. In particular, in the United States, products containing pesticides generally must be registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and similar state agencies before they can be sold or applied. The pesticides we use are manufactured by independent third parties and are evaluated by the EPA as part of its ongoing exposure risk assessment and may be subject to similar evaluation by similar state agencies. The EPA, or similar state agencies, may decide that a pesticide we use will be limited or will not be re-registered for use in the United States. We cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect of the EPAs, or a similar state agencys, continuing evaluations. The failure to obtain or the cancellation of any such registration, or the partial or complete ban of such pesticides, could have an adverse effect on our business, the severity of which would depend on the products involved, whether other products could be substituted and whether our competitors were similarly affected.\nThe use of certain pesticides, herbicides and fertilizer products is also regulated by various federal, state and local environmental and public health and safety agencies. These regulations may require that only certified or professional users apply the product or that certain products only be used on certain types of locations. These laws may also require users to post notices on properties at which products have been or will be applied, notification to individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future, or labeling of certain products or may restrict or ban the use of certain products. We can give no assurance that we can prevent violations of these or other regulations from occurring. Even if we are able to comply with all such regulations and obtain all necessary registrations and licenses, we cannot assure you that the pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers or other products we apply, or the manner in which we apply them, will not be alleged to cause injury to the environment, to people or to animals, or that such products will not be restricted or banned in certain circumstances. For example, we could be named in or subject to personal injury claims stemming from alleged environmental torts, similar to those that have been brought against certain manufacturers of herbicides. The costs of compliance, consequences of non-compliance, remediation costs and liabilities, unfavorable public perceptions of such products or products liability lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, federal, state and local agencies regulate the use, storage, treatment, disposal, handling and management of hazardous substances and wastes, emissions or discharges from our facilities or vehicles and the investigation and clean-up of contaminated sites, including our sites, customer sites and third-party sites to which we send wastes. We could incur significant costs and liabilities, including investigation and clean-up costs, fines, penalties and civil or criminal sanctions for non-compliance and claims by third parties for property and natural resource damage and personal injury under these laws and regulations. If there is a significant change in the facts or circumstances surrounding the assumptions upon which we operate, or if we are found to violate, or be liable under, applicable environmental and public health and safety laws and regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on future environmental capital expenditures and other environmental expenses and on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations, including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings relating to our business operations could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to allegations, and may be party to legal claims and regulatory proceedings, relating to our business operations. Such allegations, claims or proceedings may, for example, relate to personal injury, property damage, general liability claims relating to properties where we perform services, vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees, regulatory issues, contract disputes or employment matters and may include class actions. See Part I. Item 3 Legal Proceedings. Such allegations, claims and proceedings have been and may be brought by third parties, including our customers, employees, governmental or regulatory bodies or competitors. Defending against these and other such claims and proceedings is costly and time consuming and may divert managements attention and personnel resources from our normal business operations, and the outcome of many of these claims and proceedings cannot be predicted. If any of these claims or proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, a judgment, a fine or a settlement involving a payment of a material sum of money were to occur, or injunctive relief were issued against us, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nCurrently, we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations. However, such insurance may not fully cover all material expenses related to potential allegations, claims and proceedings, or any adverse judgments, fines or settlements resulting therefrom, as such insurance programs are often subject to significant deductibles or self-insured retentions or may not cover certain types of claims. In addition, we self-insure with respect to certain types of claims. To the extent we are subject to a higher frequency of claims, are subject to more serious claims or insurance coverage is not available, our liquidity, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are also responsible for our legal expenses relating to such claims. We reserve currently for anticipated losses and related expenses. We periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect trends in our own experience as well as industry trends. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts.\nTax increases and changes in tax rules may adversely affect our financial results\nAs a company conducting business with physical operations throughout North America, we are exposed, both directly and indirectly, to the effects of changes in U.S., state and local tax rules. Taxes for financial reporting purposes and cash tax liabilities in the future may be adversely affected by changes in such tax rules. Such changes may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our major competitors, to the extent we are unable to pass the tax costs through to our customers.\nThe Biden administration has announced in 2021 and 2022, and in certain cases has enacted, a number of tax proposals to fund new government investments in infrastructure, healthcare, and education, among other things. Certain of these proposals involve an increase in the domestic corporate tax rate, which if implemented could have a material impact on our future results of operations and cash flows. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was signed into law, with tax provisions primarily focused on implementing a 15% minimum tax on global adjusted financial statement income and a 1% excise tax on share repurchases. The IRA also creates a number of potentially beneficial tax credits to incentivize investments in certain technologies and industries which may be applicable to our business. Certain provisions of the IRA will become effective beginning in fiscal 2023. While we do not believe the IRA will have a direct negative impact on our business, the effects of the measures are unknown at this time.\nSome of the equipment that our employees use is dangerous, and an increase in accidents resulting from the use of such equipment could negatively affect our reputation, results of operations and financial position.\nMany of the services that we provide pose the risk of serious personal injury to our employees. Our employees regularly use dangerous equipment, such as lawn mowers, edgers and other power equipment. As a result, there is a significant risk of work-related injury and workers compensation claims. To the extent that we experience a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or workers compensation claims, or unfavorable developments on existing claims or fail to comply with worker health and safety regulations, our operating results and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the perception that our workplace is unsafe may damage our reputation among current and potential employees, which may impact our ability to recruit and retain employees, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAny failure, inadequacy, interruption, security failure or breach of our information technology systems, whether owned by us or outsourced or managed by third parties, could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on certain centralized automated information technology systems and networks to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the sourcing of supplies, materials and products and our services depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems and networks. Such systems and networks have experienced and could continue to be subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications problems, data corruption, software errors, network failures, security breaches, ransomware attacks, phishing attempts, acts of war or terrorist attacks, fire, flood and natural disasters. Our servers or cloud-based systems could be affected by physical or electronic break-ins, and computer viruses or similar disruptions may occur. A system outage may also cause the loss of important data or disrupt our operations. Our existing safety systems, data backup, access protection, user management, disaster recovery and information technology emergency planning may not be sufficient to prevent or minimize the effect of data loss or long-term network outages.\nWe periodically upgrade our existing information technology systems with the assistance of third party vendors, and the costs to upgrade such systems may be significant. Costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. If we cannot meet our information technology staffing needs, we may not be able to fulfill our technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems. We could be required to make significant capital expenditures to remediate any such failure, malfunction or breach with our information technology systems or networks. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems, including those caused by our failure to successfully upgrade our systems, and our inability to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential information of our customers, employees and third parties. Unlawful or unauthorized activities by third parties, and failures in systems, software, encryption technology, or other tools may facilitate or result in a compromise or breach of these systems. We are subject to risks caused by data breaches and operational disruptions, particularly through cyber-attack, cyber-intrusion or ransomware attacks, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists. Geopolitical instability, including overseas conflicts, may increase the risk that we will experience cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions. Any unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could damage our reputation, interrupt our operations and could result in a violation of applicable laws, regulations, industry standards or agreements and potentially subject us to costs, penalties and liabilities. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flow. Although we maintain insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs incurred will be fully insured.\nOur failure to comply with data privacy regulations could adversely affect our business.\nThere are new and emerging data privacy laws, as well as frequent updates and changes to existing data privacy laws, in most jurisdictions in which we operate. Failure to comply with data privacy laws can result in substantial fines or penalties, legal liability and/or reputational damage. Recently, various U.S. states have enacted stringent consumer privacy laws. Continued state by state introduction of privacy laws could lead to significantly greater complexity in our compliance requirements, which could result in complaints from data subjects and/or action from regulators. If we do not provide sufficient resources to ensure we are able to respond, adapt and implement the necessary requirements to respond to the changing data privacy landscape, which could include federal data privacy requirements in the US, we could face exposure to fines levied by regulators, which could have a significant financial impact on our business.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks, service marks and other proprietary intellectual property, including our name and logos. While it is our policy to protect and defend vigorously our intellectual property, we cannot predict whether such actions will be adequate to prevent infringement or misappropriation of these rights. Although we believe that we have sufficient rights to all of our trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property rights, we may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our business or our ability to market and promote our brands. If we are unable to successfully defend against such claims, we may be prevented from using our intellectual property rights in the future and may be liable for damages.\nAlthough we make a significant effort to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties, we may be subject to claims of infringement by third parties. Responding to and defending such claims, regardless of their merit, can be costly and time-consuming, and we may not prevail. Depending on the resolution of such claims, we may be barred from using a specific mark or other rights, may be required to enter into licensing arrangements from the third party claiming infringement or may become liable for significant damages. If any of the foregoing occurs, our ability to compete could be affected or our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important adverse consequences and adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of September 30, 2022, we had total indebtedness of $1,342.7 million, and we had availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Financing Agreement of $250.9 million and $76.6 million, respectively. See Note 9 Long-term Debt to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nOur level of debt could have important consequences, including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or other general corporate requirements, requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under the credit agreement dated December 18, 2013 (as amended, the Credit Agreement), are at variable rates of interest, limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industries in which we compete, placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors, increasing our cost of borrowing and hampering our ability to execute on our growth strategy.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which has caused our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our Credit Agreement and Receivables Financing Agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. Recent increases in interest rates have resulted in increases to the cost of servicing our debt under our Credit Agreement and Receivables Financing Agreement. For the year ended September 30, 2022, our interest expense was $53.3, compared to $42.3 for the year ended September 30, 2021. Moreover, borrowings under our Credit Agreement and Receivables Financing Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum based on a secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), which replaced LIBOR as the reference interest rate, plus a margin. If interest rates continue to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed will remain the same, our ability to refinance some or all of our existing indebtedness may be impacted and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe Credit Agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions. These covenants limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness; create or incur liens; engage in certain fundamental changes, including mergers or consolidations; sell or transfer assets; pay dividends and distributions on our subsidiaries capital stock; make acquisitions, investments, loans or advances; prepay or repurchase certain indebtedness; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into negative pledge clauses and clauses restricting subsidiary distributions.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, including a change of control. The Credit Agreement also contains a financial maintenance requirement with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility, prohibiting us from exceeding a certain first lien secured leverage ratio under certain circumstances. As a result of these covenants and restrictions, we are limited in how we conduct our business, and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.\nOur failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as others contained in our future debt instruments from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their maturity dates. In addition, any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments. If we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt, the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure such indebtedness, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future and is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, in the amounts projected or at all, or if future borrowings are not available to us in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal and interest payments, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets, delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity. The terms of our existing or future debt agreements may also restrict us from affecting any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Further, changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing, make it more difficult to obtain favorable terms, or restrict our access to these sources of future liquidity. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on our ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of our indebtedness.\nDespite our level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantially more debt, including off-balance sheet financing, contractual obligations and general and commercial liabilities. This could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, including off-balance sheet financings, contractual obligations and general and commercial liabilities. Although the Credit Agreement contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, we can increase the borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement by up to $303.0 million in the form of additional commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or incremental term loans plus an additional amount so long as we do not exceed a specified first lien secured leverage ratio. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nIf the financial institutions that are part of the syndicate of our Revolving Credit Facility fail to extend credit under our facility or reduce the borrowing base under our Revolving Credit Facility, our liquidity and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe have access to capital through our Revolving Credit Facility, which is governed by the Credit Agreement. Each financial institution which is part of the syndicate for our Revolving Credit Facility is responsible on a several, but not joint, basis for providing a portion of the loans to be made under our facility. If any participant or group of participants with a significant portion of the\ncommitments in our Revolving Credit Facility fails to satisfy its or their respective obligations to extend credit under the facility and we are unable to find a replacement for such participant or participants on a timely basis (if at all), our liquidity may be adversely affected.\nWe utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness and we will be exposed to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or non-performance of these instruments.\nWe have entered into interest rate swap instruments to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates. While our hedging strategy is designed to minimize the impact of increases in interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt, there can be no guarantee that our hedging strategy will be effective, and we may experience credit-related losses in some circumstances. See Note 10 Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our affiliates, could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\nOur employees, directors, officers and affiliates, including KKR BrightView Aggregator L.P. (KKR), hold substantial amounts of shares of our common stock. As of September 30, 2022, these stockholders held approximately 55,600,000 shares of our common stock, which represents approximately 60% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of such date. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by these stockholders, or the perception that such sales could occur, could substantially decrease the market price of our common stock. Other than restrictions on trading that arise under securities laws (or pursuant to our securities trading policy that is intended to facilitate compliance with securities laws), including the prohibition on trading in securities by or on behalf of a person who is aware of nonpublic material information, we have no restrictions on the right of our employees, directors and officers, and their affiliates, to sell their unrestricted shares of common stock.\nIn addition, as of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 6.4 million shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our incentive plans and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nThe market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities. In the future, we may also issue equity securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to you.\nKKR BrightView Aggregator L.P. has the ability to exert significant influence over us and its interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future.\nAs of September 30, 2022, KKR beneficially owns 54% of our common stock. As a result, KKR will have substantial influence over the election and removal of our directors and thereby exerts significant influence over our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, payment of dividends, if any, on our common stock, the incurrence or modification of indebtedness by us, amendment of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and entering into extraordinary transactions, and KKRs interests may not in all cases be aligned with your interests. In addition, KKR and its affiliates may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you. For example, KKR could cause us to make acquisitions that increase our indebtedness or cause us to sell revenue-generating assets.\nKKR and its affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of KKR, any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us (including any non-employee director who serves as one of our officers in both his director and officer capacities) or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. KKR and its affiliates also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nIn addition, KKR and its affiliates are able to significantly influence the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of our Board of Directors or acquisitions of our company. This concentration of voting power could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt, or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders.\nThese provisions provide for, among other things, our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock; advance notice requirements for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings; certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings; the removal of directors only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2\u20443% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors if the Sponsor and its affiliates cease to beneficially own at least 40% of shares of common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. In addition, certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may be amended only by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2\u20443% of shares of common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors if the Sponsor and its affiliates cease to beneficially own at least 40% of shares of common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. These anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third partys offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.\nOur Board of Directors is authorized to issue and designate shares of our preferred stock in additional series without stockholder approval.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors, without the approval of our stockholders, to issue 50,000,000 shares of our preferred stock, subject to limitations prescribed by applicable law, rules and regulations and the provisions of our certificate of incorporation, as shares of preferred stock in series, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. The powers, preferences and rights of these additional series of preferred stock may be senior to or on parity with our common stock, which may reduce its value.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the sole and exclusive forums for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company, (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, or other employee or stockholder of our company to the Company or our stockholders, creditors or other constituents, (iii) action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer of the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our\namended and restated bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (iv) action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our certificate of incorporation further provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the United States federal securities laws. While the Delaware Supreme Court has upheld the validity of similar provisions under the DGCL, there is uncertainty as to whether a court in another state would enforce such a forum selection provision. Our exclusive forum provision does not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our certificate of incorporation. These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. It is possible that these exclusive forum provisions may be challenged in court and may be deemed unenforceable in whole or in part. If a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nNatural disasters, terrorist attacks and other external events could adversely affect our business.\nNatural disasters, terrorist attacks and other adverse external events could materially damage our facilities or disrupt our operations, or damage the facilities or disrupt the operations of our customers or suppliers. The occurrence of any such event could prevent us from providing services and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe face risks related to heightened inflation, recession, financial market disruptions and other economic conditions.\nCustomer and consumer demand for our services may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. In addition, if the U.S. economy enters a recession, we may experience a decline in demand for our services and may have to decrease prices, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. The severity and length of time that a downturn in economic and financial market conditions may persist, as well as the timing, strength and sustainability of any recovery from such downturn, are unknown and are beyond our control. While U.S. GDP growth has been reported as positive for the calendar quarter ended September 30, 2022, many predict that the U.S. economy will enter a recession in fiscal year 2023. Therefore, the recessionary risks discussed above and elsewhere in these risk factors are more pronounced in the current economic environment.\nFailure to meet environmental, social and governance (ESG) expectations or standards or achieve our ESG goals could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price.\nIn recent years, there has been an increased focus from stakeholders, regulators and the public in general on ESG matters, including greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks, renewable energy, water stewardship, waste management, diversity, equality and inclusion, responsible sourcing and supply chain, human rights, and social responsibility. Given our commitment to ESG, we actively manage these issues and have established and publicly announced certain goals, commitments, and targets which we may refine or even expand further in the future. These goals, commitments, and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Evolving stakeholder expectations and regulatory obligations and our efforts to manage these issues, report on them, and accomplish our goals present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which could have a material adverse impact, including on our reputation and stock price.\nWe may be unable to satisfactorily meet evolving standards, regulations and disclosure requirements related to ESG. Such matters can affect the willingness or ability of investors to make an investment in our Company, as well as our ability to meet regulatory requirements, including proposed rules related to greenhouse gas emissions. Any failure, or perceived failure, to meet evolving stakeholder expectations, additional regulations and industry standards or achieve our ESG goals, commitments, and targets could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price.\nOur stock price may change significantly, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.\nOur common stock has traded on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol BV, since June 2018. Since then, our common stock has been relatively thinly traded and at times been subject to price volatility. Recently, from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022, the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange ranged from $7.65 to $17.32 per share. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above your purchase price due to various factors, including those described in this Risk Factors section. Some factors that may impact our stock price include: results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors or from those of our competitors; changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including estimates and\ninvestment recommendations by securities analysts and investors; changes in market valuations, stock prices, or earnings and other announcements by peer companies or companies in the service sector; announcements by us, our competitors, and our suppliers related to significant contracts, acquisitions, joint ventures, other strategic relationships or capital commitments; investor perceptions of or the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives; the publics response to press releases, SEC filings or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC; guidance, if any, that we provide to the public, and any changes in or our failure to meet this guidance; and the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our stock.\nFurthermore, the stock market may experience extreme volatility that, in some cases, may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, fluctuations in our stock price and limited trading volume may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stock rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction. These fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock.\nIn the past, following periods of market volatility, or following periods or events unrelated to market volatility, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from our business regardless of the merits or outcome of such litigation.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our industry. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts stop covering us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nMaintaining the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert managements attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified Board members.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, regulatory, finance, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We are also required to comply with, and incur costs associated with such compliance with, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (the Dodd-Frank Act), as well as rules and regulations implemented by the SEC and the NYSE. These rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time-consuming and costly. Our management devotes a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements, diverting the attention of management away from revenue-producing activities. These laws and regulations also could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, our board committees or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nFailure to comply with requirements to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nAs a public company, we have significant requirements for financial reporting and internal controls. The process of maintaining effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. If we are unable to maintain appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures, it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations on a timely basis, result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements and harm our results of operations. In addition, we are required, pursuant to Section 404, to furnish annually a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. Testing and maintaining internal controls may divert our managements attention from other matters that are important to our business. Our independent registered public accounting firm is also required to issue an attestation report on effectiveness of our internal controls in each annual report on Form 10-K.\nIn the future, if we identify a control deficiency that rises to the level of a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, this material weakness may adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information timely and accurately. Any material weaknesses could result in a material misstatement of our annual or quarterly consolidated financial statements or disclosures that may not be prevented or detected. In addition, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the\nremediation of any deficiencies identified by our independent registered public accounting firm in connection with the issuance of their attestation report.\nWe may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 or our independent registered public accounting firm may not issue an unqualified opinion. If either we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone. Item 2. Properties\nOur corporate headquarters is a leased facility located at 980 Jolly Road, Suite 300, Blue Bell, Pennsylvania 19422.\nWe and our operating companies own and lease a variety of facilities primarily located in the United States, for branch and service center operations and for office, call center and storage space. Our branches are strategically located to optimize route efficiency, market coverage and branch overhead. The following chart identifies the number of owned and leased facilities, other than our headquarters listed above, used by each of our operating segments as of September 30, 2022. We believe that these facilities, when considered with our headquarters, are in good operating condition and suitable and adequate to support the current needs of our business.\nSegment (1)\nOwned\nFacilities\nLeased\nFacilities\nMaintenance Services\nDevelopment Services\nTotal\n(1)\t19 facilities are shared between our segments and each is counted once, in the Maintenance Services segment, to avoid double counting. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nThe information set forth in Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, is incorporated herein by reference. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information\nOur common stock, $0.01 par value per share, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol BV on June 28, 2018. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common stock. As of September 30, 2022 there were 298 holders of record of our common stock.

Removed and Reserved Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion contains managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 items and year to year comparisons between the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. The discussion around results of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 and a comparison of our results for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 is included in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, filed with the SEC on November 17, 2021 and is incorporated by reference herein (Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2021 10-K).\nSome of the information contained in this discussion and analysis, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review Item 1A. Risk Factors and the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements sections of this Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nOur Company\nWe are the largest provider of commercial landscaping services in the United States, with revenues approximately 6 times those of our next largest commercial landscaping competitor. We provide commercial landscaping services ranging from landscape maintenance and enhancements to tree care and landscape development. We operate through a differentiated and integrated national service model which systematically delivers services at the local level by combining our network of over 290 branches with a qualified\nservice partner network. Our branch delivery model underpins our position as a single-source end-to-end landscaping solution provider to our diverse customer base at the national, regional and local levels, which we believe represents a significant competitive advantage. We believe our commercial customer base understands the financial and reputational risk associated with inadequate landscape maintenance and considers our services to be essential and non-discretionary.\nOur Segments\nWe report our results of operations through two reportable segments: Maintenance Services and Development Services. We serve a geographically diverse set of customers through our strategically located network of branches in 34 U.S. states, and, through our qualified service partner network, we are able to efficiently provide nationwide coverage in all 50 U.S. states.\nMaintenance Services\nOur Maintenance Services segment delivers a full suite of recurring commercial landscaping services in both evergreen and seasonal markets, ranging from mowing, gardening, mulching and snow removal, to more horticulturally advanced services, such as water management, irrigation maintenance, tree care, golf course maintenance and specialty turf maintenance. In addition to contracted maintenance services, we also have a strong track record of providing value-added landscape enhancements. We primarily self-perform our maintenance services through our national branch network, which are route-based in nature. Our maintenance services customers include Fortune 500 corporate campuses and commercial properties, HOAs, public parks, leading international hotels and resorts, airport authorities, municipalities, hospitals and other healthcare facilities, educational institutions, restaurants and retail, and golf courses, among others.\nDevelopment Services\nThrough our Development Services segment, we provide landscape architecture and development services for new facilities and significant redesign projects. Specific services include project design and management services, landscape architecture, landscape installation, irrigation installation, tree moving and installation, pool and water features and sports field services, among others. Our development services are comprised of sophisticated design, coordination and installation of landscapes at some of the most recognizable corporate, athletic and university complexes and showcase highly visible work that is paramount to our customers perception of our brand as a market leader.\nIn our Development Services business, we are typically hired by general contractors, with whom we maintain strong relationships as a result of our superior technical and project management capabilities. We believe the quality of our work is also well-regarded by our end-customers, some of whom directly request that their general contractors utilize our services when outsourcing their landscape development projects.\nComponents of Our Revenues and Expenses\nNet Service Revenues\nMaintenance Services\nOur Maintenance Services revenues are generated primarily through landscape maintenance services and snow removal services. Landscape maintenance services that are primarily viewed as non-discretionary, such as lawn care, mowing, gardening, mulching, leaf removal, irrigation and tree care, are provided under recurring annual contracts, which typically range from one to three years in duration and are generally cancellable by the customer with 30-90 days notice. Snow removal services are provided on either fixed fee based contracts or per occurrence contracts. Both landscape maintenance services and snow removal services can also include enhancement services that represent supplemental maintenance or improvement services generally provided under contracts of short duration related to specific services. Revenue for landscape maintenance and snow removal services under fixed fee models is recognized over time using an output based method. Additionally, a portion of our recurring fixed fee landscape maintenance and snow removal services are recorded under the series guidance. The right to invoice practical expedient, defined within Note 4 Revenue to our audited consolidated financial statements, is generally applied to revenue related to landscape maintenance and snow removal services performed in relation to per occurrence contracts as well as enhancement services. When use of the practical expedient is not appropriate for these contracts, revenue is recognized using a cost-to-cost input method. Fees for contracted landscape maintenance services are typically billed on an equal monthly basis. Fees for fixed fee snow removal services are typically billed on an equal monthly basis during snow season, while fees for time and material or other activity-based snow removal services are typically billed as the services are performed. Fees for enhancement services are typically billed as the services are performed.\nDevelopment Services\nDevelopment Services revenue is primarily recognized over time using the cost-to-cost input method, measured by the percentage of cost incurred to date to the estimated total cost for each contract, which we believe to be the best measure of progress. The full amount of anticipated losses on contracts is recorded as soon as such losses can be estimated. These losses are immaterial to current and historical\noperations. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and revenue and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.\nExpenses\nCost of Services Provided\nCost of services provided is comprised of direct costs we incur associated with our operations during a period and includes employee costs, subcontractor costs, purchased materials, and operating equipment and vehicle costs. Employee costs consist of wages and other labor-related expenses, including benefits, workers compensation and healthcare costs, for those employees involved in delivering our services. Subcontractor costs consist of costs relating to our qualified service partner network in our Maintenance Services segment and subcontractors we engage from time to time in our Development Services segment. When our use of subcontractors increases, we may experience incrementally higher costs of services provided. Operating equipment and vehicle costs primarily consist of depreciation related to branch operating equipment and vehicles and related fuel expenses. A large component of our costs are variable, such as labor, subcontractor expense and materials.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense consists of costs incurred related to compensation and benefits for management, sales and administrative personnel, equity-based compensation, branch and office rent and facility operating costs, depreciation expense related to branch and office locations, as well as professional fees, software costs, goodwill impairment, gains and losses on divestitures, and other miscellaneous expenses. Corporate expenses, including corporate executive compensation, finance, legal and information technology, are included in consolidated selling, general and administrative expense and not allocated to the business segments.\nAmortization Expense\nAmortization expense consists of the periodic amortization of intangible assets, including customer relationships, non-compete agreements and trademarks, recognized when KKR acquired the Company on December 18, 2013 and in connection with businesses we have acquired since December 18, 2013.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense relates primarily to our long term debt. See Note 9 Long-term Debt to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory U.S. income tax rate due to the effect of state and local income taxes, tax credits and certain nondeductible expenses. Our effective tax rate may vary from quarter to quarter based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including, but not limited to the geographical distribution of our pre-tax earnings, changes in the tax rates of different jurisdictions, the availability of tax credits and nondeductible items. Changes in judgment due to the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the period of the change.\nOther Expense (Income)\nOther expense (income) consists primarily of losses on debt extinguishment and investment gains and losses and gains related to investments held in Rabbi Trust.\nHow We Assess the Performance of our Business\nWe manage operations through the two operating segments described above. In addition to our GAAP financial measures, we review various non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share (Adjusted EPS), and Free Cash Flow.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are helpful supplemental measures to assist us and investors in evaluating our operating results as they exclude certain items whose fluctuations from period to period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the operations of our business. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain non-cash, non-recurring and other adjustment items. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income including interest and depreciation, and excluding other items used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA and further adjusted for the tax effect of these exclusions and the removal of the discrete tax items. Adjusted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of basic EPS. We believe that the adjustments applied in presenting Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items and about non-recurring items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future.\nWe believe Free Cash Flow is a helpful supplemental measure to assist us and investors in evaluating our liquidity. Free Cash Flow represents cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment. We believe Free Cash Flow is useful to provide additional information to assess our ability to pursue business opportunities and investments and to service our debt. Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool, including that it does not account for our future contractual commitments and excludes investments made to acquire assets under finance leases and required debt service payments.\nManagement regularly uses these measures as tools in evaluating our operating performance, financial performance and liquidity, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure and capital investments. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, and Free Cash Flow to supplement comparable GAAP measures in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to establish discretionary annual incentive compensation and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. In addition, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, and Free Cash Flow are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers, many of which also present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, and Free Cash Flow when reporting their results in an effort to facilitate an understanding of their operating and financial results and liquidity. Management supplements GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are provided in addition to, and should not be considered as alternatives to, net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and Free Cash Flow is provided in addition to, and should not be considered as an alternative to, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure derived in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, and Free Cash Flow have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company. Additionally, these measures are not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for managements discretionary use as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements.\nFor a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.\nTrends and Other Factors Affecting Our Business\nVarious trends and other factors affect or have affected our operating results, including:\nSeasonality\nOur services, particularly in our Maintenance Services segment, have seasonal variability such as increased mulching, flower planting and intensive mowing in the spring, leaf removal and cleanup work in the fall, snow removal services in the winter and potentially minimal mowing during drier summer months. This can drive fluctuations in revenue, costs and cash flows for interim periods.\nWe have a significant presence in geographies that have a year-round growing season, which we refer to as our evergreen markets. Such markets require landscape maintenance services twelve months per year. In markets that do not have a year-round growing season, which we refer to as our seasonal markets, the demand for our landscape maintenance services decreases during the winter months. Typically, our revenues and net income have been higher in the spring and summer seasons, which correspond with our third and fourth fiscal quarters of our fiscal year ended September 30. The lower level of activity in seasonal markets during our first and second fiscal quarters is partially offset by revenue from our snow removal services. Such seasonality causes our results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter.\nWeather Conditions\nWeather may impact the timing of performance of landscape maintenance and enhancement services and progress on development projects from quarter to quarter. For example, snow events in the winter, hurricane-related cleanup in the summer and fall, and the effects of abnormally high rainfall or drought in a given market may impact our services. These less predictable weather patterns can impact both our revenues and our costs, especially from quarter to quarter, but also from year to year in some cases. Extreme weather events such as hurricanes and tropical storms can result in a positive impact to our business in the form of increased enhancement services revenues related to cleanup and other services. However, such weather events may also negatively impact our ability to deliver our contracted services or impact the timing of performance.\nIn our seasonal markets, the performance of our snow removal services is correlated with the amount of snowfall and number of snowfall events in a given season. We benchmark our performance against ten- and thirty-year cumulative annual snowfall averages.\nAcquisitions\nIn addition to our organic growth, we have grown, and expect to continue to grow, our business through acquisitions in an effort to better service our existing customers and to attract new customers. These acquisitions have allowed us to execute our\nstrong-on-strong acquisition strategy in which we focus on increasing our density and leadership positions in existing local markets, entering into attractive new geographic markets and expanding our portfolio of landscape enhancement services and improving technical capabilities in specialized services. As we continue to selectively pursue acquisitions that complement our strong-on-strong acquisition strategy, we believe we are the acquirer of choice in the highly fragmented commercial landscaping industry because we offer the ability to leverage our significant size and scale, as well as provide stable and potentially expanding career opportunities for employees of acquired businesses. In accordance with GAAP, the results of the acquisitions we have completed are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. We incur transaction costs in connection with identifying and completing acquisitions and ongoing integration costs as we integrate acquired companies and seek to achieve synergies. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the Company acquired eight businesses and paid approximately $93.1 million in aggregate consideration, net of cash acquired. We incurred $8.2 million of integration costs during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, of which $5.3 million related to acquisitions completed prior to fiscal 2022 and $2.9 million related to acquisitions completed during fiscal 2022. While integration costs vary based on factors specific to each acquisition, such costs are primarily comprised of one-time employee retention costs, employee onboarding and training costs, and fleet and uniform rebranding costs. We typically anticipate integration costs to represent approximately 7%-9% of the acquisition price, and to be incurred within 12 months of acquisition completion.\nIndustry and Economic Conditions\nWe believe the non-discretionary nature of our landscape maintenance services provides us with a fairly predictable recurring revenue model. The perennial nature of the landscape maintenance service sector, as well as its wide range of end users, minimizes the impact of a broad or sector-specific downturn. However, in connection with our enhancement services and development services, when demand for commercial construction declines, demand for landscape enhancement services and development projects may decline. When commercial construction activity rises, demand for landscape enhancement services to maintain green space may also increase. This is especially true for new developments in which green space tends to play an increasingly important role. Economic conditions, including rising inflation and fuel prices, as well as rising interest rates, have impacted and may further impact our costs and expenses, and fluctuations in labor markets, may impact our ability to identify, hire and retain employees. Increased labor costs, including recruiting, retention, and overtime expenditures, have and could further adversely affect our profitability.\nCOVID-19 Update\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic conditions on the Companys results continue to be highly uncertain and outside the Companys control. Although our Maintenance and Development operations are considered essential services, future governmental orders or other restrictions may limit, restrict or prohibit operations in the future. Further limitations could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The scope, duration and magnitude of the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are difficult or impossible to anticipate. Due to the uncertainty related to the extent of the ongoing impact of the pandemic, the Companys results in fiscal year 2022 may not be indicative of the Companys future results. For additional information on the risks posed by COVID-19, see Item 1A - Risk Factors.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n(In millions)\nNet service revenues\n$\n2,774.6\n$\n2,553.6\nCost of services provided\n2,099.8\n1,902.8\nGross profit\n674.8\n650.8\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n534.9\n508.0\nAmortization expense\n51.5\n52.3\nIncome from operations\n88.4\n90.5\nOther expense (income)\n15.5\n(2.7\n)\nInterest expense\n53.3\n42.3\nIncome before income taxes\n19.6\n50.9\nIncome tax expense\n5.6\n4.6\nNet income\n$\n14.0\n$\n46.3\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)\n$\n287.9\n$\n302.3\nAdjusted Net Income (1)\n$\n100.9\n$\n126.3\nCash flows from operating activities\n$\n106.9\n$\n148.4\nFree Cash Flow(1)\n$\n6.7\n$\n96.7\n(1)\tSee Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2022 compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2021\nNet Service Revenues\nNet service revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 increased $221.0 million, or 8.7%, to $2,774.6 million, from $2,553.6 million in the 2021 period. The increase was driven by increases in Maintenance Services revenues of $99.1 million and Development Services revenues of $123.9 million as discussed further below in Segment Results.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 increased $24.0 million, or 3.7%, to $674.8 million, from $650.8 million in the 2021 period principally driven by the increases in Maintenance Services and Development Services revenues. Gross margin decreased 120 basis points to 24.3% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, from 25.5% in the 2021 period driven by increases in materials and fuel costs as a percentage of revenue.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 increased $26.9 million, or 5.3%, to $534.9 million, from $508.0 million in the 2021 period. The increase was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions as well as the reinstatement of the employer match for the employee savings plan coupled with a slight increase in travel costs. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expense decreased 60 basis points for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 to 19.3%, from 19.9% in the 2021 period.\nAmortization Expense\nAmortization expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 decreased $0.8 million, or 1.5%, to $51.5 million, from $52.3 million in the 2021 period. The decrease was principally due to a $4.2 million decrease in the amortization of historical intangible assets recognized in connection with the KKR Acquisition and the ValleyCrest Acquisition, based on the pattern consistent with expected future cash flows calculated at that time, partially offset by a $3.4 million increase in amortization expense for intangible assets recognized in connection with our acquired businesses subsequent to the ValleyCrest Acquisition.\nOther Expense (Income)\nOther expense was $15.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $2.7 million of income in the 2021 period. The $18.2 million increase in expense was driven principally by the losses on the extinguishment of debt in connection with the amendment dated April 22, 2022 (Amendment No. 6) to our credit agreement dated December 18, 2013 (as amended, the Credit Agreement) and the change in value of investments held in the Rabbi Trust.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 increased $11.0 million, or 26.0%, to $53.3 million, from $42.3 million in the 2021 period. The increase was driven by an increased weighted average interest rate on the Series B Term Loan in the 2022 period of 3.76% compared to 2.65% in the 2021 period, coupled with the increase in the borrowings under the Series B Term Loan associated with Amendment No. 6 to the Credit Agreement, partially offset by the impact of our interest rate swaps for the period.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, income tax expense increased $1.0 million, or 21.7%, to $5.6 million, compared to $4.6 million in the 2021 period. The change in income tax expense is primarily attributable to the tax planning benefit that was included in the Companys income tax expense for the 2021 period, partially offset by a decrease in pretax income to $19.6 million compared to pretax income of $50.9 million in the 2021 period.\nNet Income\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, net income decreased by $32.3 million, to $14.0 million, from $46.3 million in the 2021 period. The decrease in net income was primarily due to the changes noted above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $14.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, to $287.9 million, from $302.3 million in the 2021 period. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of revenue was 10.4% and 11.8% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was principally driven by a decrease of $20.8 million, or 6.9% in Maintenance Services Segment Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by an increase of $8.5 million, or 13.0% in Development Services Segment Adjusted EBITDA, as discussed further below in Segment Results.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 decreased $25.4 million to $100.9 million, from $126.3 million in the 2021 period due to the changes noted above.\nSegment Results\nWe classify our business into two segments: Maintenance Services and Development Services. Our corporate operations are not allocated to the segments and are not discussed separately as any results that had a significant impact on operating results are included in the consolidated results discussion above.\nWe evaluate the performance of our segments on Net Service Revenues, Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin (Segment Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net Service Revenues). Segment Adjusted EBITDA is indicative of operational performance and ongoing profitability. Our management closely monitors Segment Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate past performance and identify actions required to improve profitability.\nSegment Results for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nThe following tables present Net Service Revenues, Segment Adjusted EBITDA, and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin for each of our segments. Changes in Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin are shown in basis points, or bps.\nMaintenance Services Segment Results\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\nPercent Change\n(In millions)\n2022 vs. 2021\nNet Service Revenues\n$\n2,082.0\n$\n1,982.9\n5.0\n%\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n278.8\n$\n299.6\n(6.9\n)%\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA Margin\n13.4\n%\n15.1\n%\n(170) bps\nMaintenance Services Net Service Revenues\nMaintenance Services net service revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 increased by $99.1 million, or 5.0%, compared to the 2021 period. Revenues from landscape maintenance services were $1,825.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $127.7 million over the 2021 period. The increase in landscape maintenance service revenues was primarily driven by a $74.5 million, or 4.4%, increase in underlying commercial landscape services underpinned by a combination of contract services growth and to a greater extent ancillary services growth, as well as a $53.2 million revenue contribution from acquired businesses. Offsetting this was a decrease of $28.6 million in snow removal services, net of $21.1 million from acquired businesses, due to overall less snowfall during the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the 2021 period.\nMaintenance Services Segment Adjusted EBITDA\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 decreased $20.8 million, to $278.8 million, compared to $299.6 million in the 2021 period. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased 170 basis points, to 13.4%, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, from 15.1% in the 2021 period. The decreases in Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin were principally driven by the decrease in snow removal revenues, higher fuel costs and the reinstatement of the employer match for the employee savings plan, partially offset by increases in revenues from underlying commercial landscape services and acquisitions discussed above.\nDevelopment Services Segment Results\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\nPercent Change\n(In millions)\n2022 vs. 2021\nNet Service Revenues\n$\n698.8\n$\n574.9\n21.6\n%\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n73.7\n$\n65.2\n13.0\n%\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA Margin\n10.5\n%\n11.3\n%\n(80) bps\nDevelopment Services Net Service Revenues\nDevelopment Services net service revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 increased $123.9 million, or 21.6%, compared to the 2021 period. The increase was driven by a $65.2 million revenue contribution from acquired businesses combined with an increase of $58.7 million due to additional project volumes.\nDevelopment Services Segment Adjusted EBITDA\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 increased $8.5 million, to $73.7 million, compared to $65.2 million in the 2021 period, principally as a result of the increases in revenues described above, partially offset by higher materials costs and the reinstatement of the employer match for the employee savings plan. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased 80 basis points, to 10.5% for the period from 11.3% in the 2021 period, primarily as a result of higher materials and fuel costs as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by lower labor costs as a percentage of revenue.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nSet forth below are the reconciliations of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income and cash flows from operating activities to Free Cash Flow.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n(in millions)\nAdjusted EBITDA\nNet income\n$\n14.0\n$\n46.3\nPlus:\nInterest expense, net\n53.3\n42.3\nIncome tax expense\n5.6\n4.6\nDepreciation expense\n98.9\n84.7\nAmortization expense\n51.5\n52.3\nBusiness transformation and integration costs (a)\n21.5\n28.5\nOffering-related expenses (b)\n0.1\n0.6\nEquity-based compensation (c)\n19.0\n20.0\nCOVID-19 related expenses (d)\n11.4\n23.0\nDebt extinguishment (e)\n12.6\n-\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n287.9\n$\n302.3\nAdjusted Net Income\nNet income\n14.0\n46.3\nPlus:\nAmortization expense\n51.5\n52.3\nBusiness transformation and integration costs (a)\n21.5\n28.5\nOffering-related expenses (b)\n0.1\n0.6\nEquity-based compensation (c)\n19.0\n20.0\nCOVID-19 related expenses (d)\n11.4\n23.0\nDebt extinguishment (e)\n12.6\n-\nIncome tax adjustment (f)\n(29.2\n)\n(44.4\n)\nAdjusted Net Income\n$\n100.9\n$\n126.3\nFree Cash Flow\nCash flows from operating activities\n$\n106.9\n$\n148.4\nMinus:\nCapital expenditures\n107.3\n61.2\nPlus:\nProceeds from sale of property and equipment\n7.1\n9.5\nFree Cash Flow\n$\n6.7\n$\n96.7\n(a)Business transformation and integration costs consist of (i) severance and related costs; (ii) business integration costs and (iii) information technology infrastructure, transformation costs, and other.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n(in millions)\nSeverance and related costs\n$\n1.6\n$\n0.3\nBusiness integration (g)\n8.2\n14.0\nIT infrastructure, transformation, and other (h)\n11.7\n14.2\nBusiness transformation and integration costs\n$\n21.5\n$\n28.5\n(b)Represents transaction related expenses incurred for IPO related litigation and completed or contemplated subsequent registration statements.\n(c)Represents equity-based compensation expense and related taxes recognized for equity incentive plans outstanding.\n(d)Represents expenses related to the Companys response to the COVID-19 pandemic, principally temporary and incremental salary and related expenses, personal protective equipment, cleaning and supply purchases, and other.

Such expenses are excluded from the measures disclosed above since such expenses vary in amount based on occurrence as well as factors specific to each of the activities, are outside of the normal operations of the business, and create a lack of comparability between periods.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nOur principal sources of liquidity are existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and borrowings under the Credit Agreement and the Receivables Financing Agreement (as defined below). Our principal uses of cash are to provide working capital, meet debt service requirements, fund capital expenditures and finance strategic plans, including acquisitions. We may also seek to finance capital expenditures under finance leases or other debt arrangements that provide liquidity or favorable borrowing terms. We continue to consider acquisition opportunities, but the size and timing of any future acquisitions and the related potential capital requirements cannot be predicted. While we have in the past financed certain acquisitions with internally generated cash, in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon acceptable terms, we may obtain all or a portion of the necessary financing through the incurrence of additional long-term borrowings.\nBased on our current level of operations and available cash, we believe our cash flow from operations, together with availability under the Revolving Credit Facility under the Credit Agreement and the Receivables Financing Agreement (each as defined below), will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements, debt service requirements and capital spending requirements for the next twelve months.\nA substantial portion of our liquidity needs arise from debt service requirements, and from the ongoing cost of operations, working capital and capital expenditures.\nSeptember 30,\n(In millions)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n20.1\n$\n123.7\nShort-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt\n$\n12.0\n$\n10.4\nLong-term debt\n$\n1,330.7\n$\n1,130.6\nTotal debt\n$\n1,342.7\n$\n1,141.0\nThe Company is party to the Credit Agreement, a five-year revolving credit facility that, pursuant to the Amendment Agreement, currently matures on April 22, 2027 (the Revolving Credit Facility) and, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, a receivables financing\nagreement dated April 28, 2017 (as amended, the Receivables Financing Agreement). Each of the Company's credit facilities bear interest based in-part on a secured overnight financing rate. See Description of Indebtedness.\nWe can increase the borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement or increase the term loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement by up to $303.0 million, in the aggregate, in the form of additional commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or incremental term loans under the Credit Agreement, or in the form of other indebtedness in lieu thereof, plus an additional amount so long as we do not exceed a specified first lien secured leverage ratio. We can incur such additional secured or other unsecured indebtedness under the Credit Agreement if certain specified conditions are met. Our liquidity requirements are significant primarily due to debt service requirements. See Note 9 Long-term Debt to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or future borrowings may not be available to us under our Revolving Credit Facility or the Receivables Financing Agreement in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. Our ability to do so depends on, among other factors, prevailing economic conditions, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a change in control, we could be required to repay or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the Series B Term Loan under the Credit Agreement, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any future acquisitions, joint ventures, or other similar transactions may require additional capital and there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nCash Flows\nInformation about our cash flows, by category, is presented in our statements of cash flows and is summarized below:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n(In millions)\nOperating activities\n$\n106.9\n$\n148.4\nInvesting activities\n$\n(193.7\n)\n$\n(158.7\n)\nFinancing activities\n$\n(16.8\n)\n$\n(23.1\n)\nFree Cash Flow (1)\n$\n6.7\n$\n96.7\n(1)\tSee Non-GAAP Financial Measures above for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nCash Flows provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 decreased $41.5 million, to $106.9 million, from $148.4 million in the 2021 period. This decrease was due to a decrease in the cash provided by accounts payable and other operating liabilities principally due to the impact of the repayment of the payroll tax deferral under the CARES Act. This was partially offset by an increase in cash provided by accounts receivable and unbilled and deferred revenue.\nCash Flows used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $193.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $35.0 million compared to $158.7 million for the 2021 period. The increase was driven by an increase of $46.1 million in cash used for capital expenditures driven principally by receipted orders previously impacted by pandemic-related supply chain challenges, partially offset by a decrease of $17.3 million in cash used for acquisitions in comparison to the 2021 period.\nCash Flows used in Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities of $16.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 included proceeds from the April 22, 2022 refinancing of our term loan with the Series B Term Loan, net of issuance costs of $1,180.1 million, partially offset by repayments of our term loan of $1,006.3 million and repayments of the previous draw on our Revolving Credit Facility of $165.0 million. Proceeds from our Receivables Financing Agreement, net of issuance costs of $391.7 million were partially offset by repayments of our Receivables Financing Agreement of $374.4 million. Additionally, repurchases of common stock and distributions totaled $163.8 million and repayments of finance lease obligations totaled $27.0 million in the period.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree Cash Flow decreased $90.0 million to $6.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 from $96.7 million in the 2021 period. The decrease in Free Cash Flow was due to a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures, as described above.\nWorking Capital\n(In millions)\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nNet Working Capital:\nCurrent assets\n$\n677.1\n$\n710.8\nLess: Current liabilities\n488.4\n496.1\nNet working capital\n$\n188.7\n$\n214.7\nNet working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Net working capital decreased $26.0 million, to $188.7 million, at September 30, 2022, from $214.7 million at September 30, 2021, primarily driven by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $103.6 million coupled with an increase in deferred revenue of $11.1 million and an increase in accounts payable of $6.8 million. This was partially offset by an increase in other current assets of $32.2 million, a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $27.4 million, an increase in unbilled revenue of $19.0 million and an increase in accounts receivable, net of $18.7 million.\nDescription of Indebtedness\nSeries B Term Loan due 2029\nOn April 22, 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 6 to the Credit Agreement (the Amendment Agreement). Under the terms of the Amendment Agreement, the existing Credit Agreement (as amended prior to but not including under the Amendment Agreement, the Amended Credit Agreement) was amended to provide for: (i) a $1,200.0 seven-year term loan (the Series B Term Loan) and (ii) a $300.0 five-year revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility). The Series B Term Loan matures on April 22, 2029 and bears interest at a rate per annum of a secured overnight financing rate (Term SOFR), plus a margin of either 3.25% or 3.00% or a base rate (ABR) plus a margin of either 2.25% or 2.00%, subject to SOFR and ABR floors of 0.50% and 1.50%, respectively, with the margin on the Series B Term Loan determined based on the Companys first lien net leverage ratio. The Company used the net proceeds from the Series B Term Loan to repay all amounts outstanding under the Companys Amended Credit Agreement. As a result of the repayment of the amounts outstanding under the Company's Amended Credit Agreement, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $12.6 due to accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees and original issue discount included in the Other (expense) income line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. An original issue discount of $12.0 was incurred when the Series B Term Loan was issued and is being amortized using the effective interest method over the life of the debt, resulting in an effective yield of 3.42%. Debt repayments for the Series B Term Loan totaled $1,006.3 and $10.4 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively.\nIn addition to scheduled payments, the Company is obligated to pay a percentage of excess cash flow, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, as payments to principal. The percentage varies with the ratio of the Companys debt to its cash flow. The excess cash flow calculation did not result in any required payment due for the periods ended September 30, 2022, September 30, 2021, and September 30, 2020.\nRevolving credit facility\nThe Company has a five-year $300 revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) that matures on April 22, 2027 and bears interest at a rate per annum of Term SOFR plus a margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.50%, or ABR plus a margin ranging from 1.00 to 1.50%, subject to SOFR and ABR floors of 0.00% and 1.00%, respectively, with the margin on the Revolving Credit Facility determined based on the Companys first lien net leverage ratio. The Revolving Credit Facility replaced the previous $260.0 revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement. The Company had no outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. There were $165.0 borrowings under the facility during the year ended September 30, 2022, of which, $165.0 were repaid during the same period. There were no borrowings or repayments under the facility for the year ended September 30, 2021. There is a quarterly commitment fee equal to either 1\u20444 of 1% or 3/8 of 1% of the unused balance of the Revolving Credit Facility depending on the Companys first lien net leverage ratio. The Company had $49.1 and $52.3 of letters of credits issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility was 2.3% for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nReceivables financing agreement\nOn April 28, 2017, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a receivables financing agreement (the Receivables Financing Agreement). On February 19, 2021, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Receivables Financing Agreement (the Second Amendment) which extended the term through February 20, 2024 and increased the borrowing capacity to $235.0 through September 20, 2021 and $250.0 thereafter. On June 22, 2022, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the Receivables Financing Agreement (the Third Amendment) which extended the term through June 22, 2025 and increased the borrowing capacity to $275.0. All amounts outstanding under the Receivables Financing Agreement are collateralized by\nsubstantially all of the accounts receivable and unbilled revenue of the Company. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company borrowed $392.0 against the capacity and voluntarily repaid $374.4. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company borrowed $34.5 against the capacity and voluntarily repaid $24.6.\nFor additional information on our material indebtedness, including our First Lien Term Loans, Series B Term Loans and Revolving Credit Facility and our outstanding borrowings under the Receivables Financing Agreement, see Note 9 Long-term Debt in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nAs of September 30, 2022, September 30, 2021, and September 30, 2020, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and no event of default had occurred or was ongoing.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe Companys primary contractual obligations include the payment of interest and principal on our outstanding long term debt, our operating and finance lease portfolios, and other operational purchase obligations\nThe Company has outstanding variable-rate debt through its Series B Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, Receivables Financing Agreement and other debt instruments, which hold varying maturities. See Note 9 Long-term Debt to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information, including the timing of principal and interest payments associated with the Companys long term debt.\nThe Company has operating and finance leases for branch and administrative offices, vehicles, certain machinery and equipment, and furniture. The Companys leases have remaining lease terms of one month up to 11.3 years. See Note 12 Leases to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information, including the maturity schedule of future principal and interest payments associated with our finance and operating lease portfolios.\nPurchase obligations include commitments for various products and services made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements, including the procurement of capital assets. As of September 30, 2022 the Company had $48.1 million of operational purchase obligations, with $39.6 million payable within twelve months. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items for which we are contractually obligated as of September 30, 2022.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAccounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition. Certain of these estimates include determining fair value. All of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates, future economic and market conditions and their effect based on information available as of the date of these consolidated financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change, which may result in future impairments of goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets, increases in reserves for contingencies, establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increase in tax liabilities, among other effects. Also see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, which discusses the significant accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives.\nAcquisitions\nFrom time to time we enter into strategic acquisitions in an effort to better service existing customers and to attain new customers. When we acquire a controlling financial interest in an entity or group of assets that are determined to meet the definition of a business, we apply the acquisition method described in ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. In accordance with GAAP, the results of the acquisitions we have completed are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition forward.\nWe allocate the purchase consideration paid to acquire the business to the assets and liabilities acquired based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. If during the measurement period (a period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date) we receive additional information that existed as of the acquisition date but at the time of the original allocation described above was unknown to us, we make the appropriate adjustments to the purchase price allocation in the reporting period the amounts are determined.\nSignificant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically engage third-party valuation specialists, who work under the direction of management, to assist in valuing significant tangible and intangible assets acquired.\nThe fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain.\nWe typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants, and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), a brands relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\nDetermining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. All of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., trademarks, non-compete agreements and customer relationships) are expected to have finite useful lives. Our estimates of the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets are based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the regions in which the brands are sold.\nThe costs of finite-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. The value of residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment as described in the following note.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the underlying net assets acquired in an acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year using data as of July 1 of that year.\nGoodwill is allocated to, and evaluated for impairment at our three identified reporting units. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount. We may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform the quantitative impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the carrying value of the reporting units net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. The Company determined fair values of each of the reporting units using a combination of the income and market multiple approaches. The estimates used in each approach include significant management assumptions, including long-term future growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and future economic and market conditions.\nIf the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required, and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is recorded as an impairment loss, the amount of which not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nOur methodology for estimating the fair value of our reporting units utilizes a combination of the market and income approaches. The market approach is based on the guideline public company method, which measures the value of the reporting unit through applying valuation multiples of selected guideline public companies to the reporting units key operating metrics. The income approach is based on the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method, which is based on the present value of future cash flows. The principal assumptions utilized in the DCF methodology include long-term future growth rates, operating margins, and discount rates. There can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flow, long-term future growth rates and operating margins made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. We believe the current assumptions and estimates utilized under each approach are both reasonable and appropriate.\nBased on our most recent annual analysis as of July 1, 2022, the fair values for all three of our reporting units exceeded the carrying values, and therefore no indicators of impairment existed for those three reporting units; however, the fair value of the Maintenance reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 7.8%. Since the Maintenance reporting unit fair value did not substantially exceed the carrying value we may be at risk for an impairment loss in the future if forecasted trends assumed in the fair value calculation are not realized. As of September 30, 2022, there was $1,786.9 million of goodwill recorded related to the Maintenance reporting unit. See Note 7 Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Acquisitions to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nLong-lived Assets (Excluding Goodwill)\nLong-lived assets with finite lives are depreciated and amortized generally on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. These lives are based on our previous experience for similar assets, potential market obsolescence and other industry and business data. Property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value. Changes in estimated useful lives or in the asset values could cause us to adjust our book value or future expense accordingly.\nNet Service Revenues\nWe perform landscape maintenance and enhancement services, development services, other landscape services and snow removal services. Revenue is recognized based upon the service provided and the contract terms and is reported net of discounts and applicable sales taxes.\nMaintenance Services\nOur Maintenance Services revenues are generated primarily through landscape maintenance services and snow removal services. Landscape maintenance services that are primarily viewed as non-discretionary, such as lawn care, mowing, gardening, mulching, leaf removal, irrigation and tree care, are provided under recurring annual contracts, which typically range from one to three years in duration and are generally cancellable by the customer with 30-90 days notice. Snow removal services are provided on either fixed fee based contracts or per occurrence contracts. Both landscape maintenance services and snow removal services can also include enhancement services that represent supplemental maintenance or improvement services generally provided under contracts of short duration related to specific services. Revenue for landscape maintenance and snow removal services under fixed fee models is recognized over time using an output based method. Additionally, a portion of our recurring fixed fee landscape maintenance and snow removal services are recorded under the series guidance. The right to invoice practical expedient, defined within Note 4 Revenue to our audited consolidated financial statements, is generally applied to revenue related to landscape maintenance and snow removal services performed in relation to per occurrence contracts as well as enhancement services. When use of the practical expedient is not appropriate for these contracts, revenue is recognized using a cost-to-cost input method. Fees for contracted landscape maintenance services are typically billed on an equal monthly basis. Fees for fixed fee snow removal services are typically billed on an equal monthly basis during snow season, while fees for time and material or other activity-based snow removal services are typically billed as the services are performed. Fees for enhancement services are typically billed as the services are performed.\nDevelopment Services\nDevelopment Services revenue is primarily recognized over time using the cost-to-cost input method, measured by the percentage of cost incurred to date to the estimated total cost for each contract, which we believe to be the best measure of progress. The full amount of anticipated losses on contracts is recorded as soon as such losses can be estimated. These losses have been immaterial in prior periods. Changes in job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability, including final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and revenue and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.\nRisk Management and Insurance\nWe carry general liability, auto liability, workers compensation, professional liability, directors and officers liability, and employee health care insurance policies. In addition, we carry umbrella liability insurance policies to cover claims over the liability limits contained in the primary policies. Our insurance programs for workers compensation, general liability, auto liability and employee health care for certain employees contain self-insured retention amounts, deductibles and other coverage limits (self-insured liability). Claims that are not self-insured as well as claims in excess of the self-insured liability amounts are insured. We use estimates in the determination of the required accrued self-insured claims. These estimates are based upon calculations performed by third-party actuaries, as well as examination of historical trends, and industry claims experience. We adjust our estimate of accrued self-insured claims when required to reflect changes based on factors such as changes in health care costs, accident frequency and claim severity. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, accident frequency and claim severity can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities.\nEquity-based Compensation\nWe account for equity-based compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which require all equity-based payments to employees and non-employees, including grants of stock options, to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and non-employees. This model requires certain assumptions including the estimated expected term of the stock options, the risk-free interest rate and the exercise price, of which certain assumptions are highly complex and subjective. The expected option life represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding based on managements best estimate of the timing of a liquidity event and the contractual term of the stock option. As there is not sufficient trading history of our common stock, we use a group of our competitors which we believe are similar to us, adjusted for our capital structure, in order to estimate volatility. Our exercise price is the stock price on the date in which shares were granted.\nPrior to our IPO, our stock price was calculated based on a combination of the income and market multiple approaches. Under the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method, forecasted cash flows are discounted to the present value at a risk-adjusted discount rate. The valuation analyses determine discrete free cash flows over several years based on forecast financial information provided by management and a terminal value for the residual period beyond the discrete forecast, which are discounted at an appropriate rate to estimate our enterprise value. Under the market multiple approach, specifically the guideline public company methods, we selected publicly traded companies with similar financial and operating characteristics as us and calculated valuation multiples based on the guideline public companys financial information and market data. Subsequent to the IPO, the estimation of our stock price is no longer necessary as we rely on the market price to determine the market value of our common stock.\nWe use a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value of performance stock units granted to employees. This model requires certain assumptions including the risk-free interest rate and the number of shares expected to vest. The number of shares expected to vest represents the expected achievement of certain performance conditions. Our vesting price is the stock price on the date in which shares were granted.\nFor additional information related to the assumptions used, see Note 13 Equity Based Compensation to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nIncome Taxes\nThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires managements judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We may establish contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions, and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. Such reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review. Several years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved or clarified. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, issues raised by a tax authority may be finally resolved at an amount different than the related reserve. Such differences could materially increase or decrease our income tax provision in the current and/or future periods. When facts and circumstances change (including a resolution of an issue or statute of limitations expiration), these reserves are adjusted through the provision for income taxes in the period of change.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nMeasurement of Credit Losses\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurements of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which was amended in May 2019 by ASU No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments and ASU No. 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief. These ASUs require entities to account for expected credit losses on financial instruments including trade receivables. The Company adopted the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nFair Value Measurement\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement which modifies the disclosures on fair value measurements by removing the requirement to disclose the amount and reason for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the policy for timing of such transfers. The ASU expands the disclosure requirements for Level 3 fair value measurements, primarily focused on changes in unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income. The Company adopted the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The adoption of ASU No. 2018-13 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nSimplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes which removes specified exceptions and adds requirements to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The Company adopted the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nReference Rate Reform\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting which provides optional expedients and exceptions for the accounting for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The guidance is effective for the Company upon issuance through December 31, 2022. The guidance in ASU 2020-04 is optional and may be elected over time as reference rate reform activities occur. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the Company elected to apply the hedge accounting expedients related to probability and the assessments of effectiveness for future LIBOR-indexed cash flows to assume that the index upon which future hedged transactions will be based matches the index on the corresponding derivatives. Application of these expedients preserves the presentation of derivatives consistent with past presentation. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01 to clarify the scope of certain optional expedients for derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the guidance on its consolidated financial statements and may apply other elections as applicable as additional changes in the market occur.\nBusiness Combinations\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers which requires that an entity (acquirer) recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606 as if it had originated the contracts. The guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our variable rate borrowings. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk by using pay-fixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of a portion of our variable rate debt. We have historically targeted hedging between 30% and 50% of the principal amount outstanding under our Series B Term Loan.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had variable rate debt outstanding of $1.35 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% for the year ended September 30, 2022, excluding the impact of our outstanding hedge agreements. Substantially all of our outstanding variable rate debt was incurred under the Amended Credit Agreement and the Receivables Financing Agreement. Each of these loans bears interest based on SOFR plus a spread.\nWe use interest rate swaps to offset our exposure to interest rate movements. These outstanding interest rate swaps qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted SOFR-based interest payments. At September 30, 2022, we were a fixed rate payer on fixed-floating interest rate swap contracts that effectively fixed the LIBOR-based index which serves as a proxy for the SOFR-based index used to determine the interest rates charged on our SOFR-based variable rate borrowings. See Note 10 Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nBased on the debt outstanding and hedge contracts in place for the year ended September 30, 2022, a 100 basis point change in interest rates on our variable rate debt would result in a change to our fiscal 2022 interest expense by approximately $7.6 million inclusive of the impact from the active hedge contracts. Actual interest rates could change significantly more than 100 bps.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk for changes in fuel prices through the consumption of fuel by our vehicle fleet and mowers in the delivery of services to our customers. We purchase our fuel at prevailing market prices. We manage our exposure through the execution of a documented hedging strategy. We have historically entered into fuel swap contracts to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices when appropriate. We do not currently have any open fuel-based derivative instruments.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022 we purchased approximately 18.3 million gallons of fuel. A ten percent change in fuel prices would have resulted in a change of approximately $7.5 million in our annual fuel cost inclusive of the impact from the hedge contracts which expired on December 31, 2021.\nWe continue to monitor our exposure and the current pricing environment and may execute new fuel-based derivative instruments in the future. See Note 10 Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe consolidated financial statements, supplementary information and financial statement schedules of the Company are set forth beginning on page of this report. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nRegulations under the Exchange Act require public companies, including us, to maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act to mean a companys controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required or necessary disclosures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. The design of any controls and procedures also is based on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022. Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2022, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at a reasonable assurance level.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the process or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022 based on the framework set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, the Companys management concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2022.\nThe effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Refer to Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting on page herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nRegulations under the Exchange Act require public companies to evaluate any change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. There have been no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the Companys most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 17, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nGoodwill - Maintenance Reporting Unit - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Companys evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value annually in the fourth quarter of each year using data as of July 1 of that year. The Company performed a quantitative test to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to long-term future growth rates, operating margins, discount rate and future economic and market conditions. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The fair value of the Maintenance reporting unit as of the measurement date of July 1, 2022 exceeded the carrying value. Therefore, no impairment was recognized.\nWe identified the valuation of goodwill allocated to the Maintenance reporting unit as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the Maintenance reporting unit. Auditing the income approach fair value of this reporting unit involved a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased effort, which included the involvement of our fair value specialists, as it related to evaluating whether managements significant estimates and assumptions related to long-term future growth rates, operating margins, discount rate and future economic and market conditions were appropriate.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the significant estimates and assumptions of long-term future growth rates, operating margins, discount rate and future economic and market conditions used by management to estimate the fair value of the Maintenance reporting unit included the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of internal controls over managements goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value of the Maintenance reporting unit, including controls related to managements significant estimates and assumptions of long-term future growth rates, operating margins, discount rate and future economic and market conditions.\nWe evaluated managements ability to accurately forecast future Maintenance reporting unit revenue and operating margin by comparing actual results to managements historical forecasts.\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of managements Maintenance reporting unit revenue and operating margin forecasts by comparing the forecasts to:\nohistorical results,\nointernal communications to management and the Board of Directors, and\noforecasted information included in analyst and industry reports for the Company and certain peer companies.\nWith the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated (1) the valuation methodology used and (2) the projections of long-term future growth rates and the discount rate by testing the underlying source information, and by developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the rate selected by management.\n/S/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nPhiladelphia, PA\nNovember 17, 2022\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2014.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of BrightView Holdings, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of BrightView Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and related notes as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022, of the Company and our report dated November 17, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/S/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nPhiladelphia, PA\nNovember 17, 2022\nBrightView Holdings, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In millions, except par value

millions, except per share and share data)\n1.\tBusiness\nBrightView Holdings, Inc. (the Company and, collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries, BrightView) provides landscape maintenance and enhancements, landscape development, snow removal and other landscape related services for commercial customers throughout the United States. BrightView is aligned into two reportable segments: Maintenance Services and Development Services. Prior to its initial public offering completed in July 2018 (the IPO), the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of BrightView Parent L.P. (Parent), an affiliate of KKR & Co. Inc. (KKR). The Parent and Company were formed through a series of transactions entered into by KKR to acquire the Company on December 18, 2013 (the KKR Acquisition). The Parent was dissolved in August 2018 following the IPO.\nBasis of Presentation\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries which are directly or indirectly owned by the Company. Results of acquired companies are included in the consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the acquisition. All intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts, revenue recognition, self-insurance reserves, estimates related to the Companys assessment of goodwill for impairment, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, realizability of deferred tax assets, and litigation based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from estimates.\n2.\tSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include deposits in banks and money market funds with maturities of less than three months at the time of deposit or investment.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company reserves for all accounts that are deemed to be uncollectible and reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts regularly. The allowance is based on the age of receivables and a specific identification of receivables considered at risk, representing its best estimate of probable credit losses in existing trade accounts receivable (see Note 5 Accounts Receivable, net). Account balances are written off against the allowance when the potential for recovery is considered remote.\nAccounts receivable also includes customer balances that have been billed or are billable to the Companys customers but will not be collected until completion of the project or as otherwise specified in the contract. These amounts generally represent 5-10% of the total contract value.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is carried at cost, including the cost of labor for internal use software, less accumulated depreciation, except for those assets acquired through a business combination, in which case they have been stated at estimated fair value as of the date of the business combination, less accumulated depreciation. Costs of replacements or maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the life of the related assets are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets and included in Cost of services provided or Selling, general and administrative expense as appropriate.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the underlying net assets acquired in an acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year using data as of July 1 of that year.\nGoodwill is allocated to, and evaluated for impairment at, the Companys three identified reporting units. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount. The Company may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform the quantitative impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires the Company to compare the carrying value of the reporting units net assets to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The Company determines the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units using a combination of the income and market multiple approaches. The estimates used in each approach include significant management assumptions, including long-term future growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and future economic and market conditions.\nIf the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required, and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recorded as an impairment loss, the amount of which is not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets consist principally of acquired customer contracts and relationships, non-compete agreements and trademarks. Acquired customer relationships are amortized in an accelerated pattern consistent with expected future cash flows. Non-compete agreements and trademarks are amortized straight-line over their estimated useful lives.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nProperty and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value.\nFinancing Costs\nFinancing costs, consisting of fees and other expenses associated with borrowings, are amortized over the terms of the related borrowings using the effective interest rate method (see Note 9 Long-term Debt). Financing costs are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the related borrowings.\nSelf-Insurance Reserves\nThe Company carries general liability, vehicle liability, workers compensation, professional liability, directors and officers liability, cyber security and employee health care insurance policies. In addition, the Company carries umbrella liability insurance policies to cover claims over the liability limits contained in the primary policies. The Companys insurance programs for general liability, vehicle liability, workers compensation and employee health care for certain employees contain self-insured retention amounts. Claims that are not self-insured as well as claims in excess of the self-insured retention amounts are insured. The Company uses estimates in the determination of the required reserves. These estimates are based upon calculations performed by third-party actuaries, as well as examination of historical trends, demographic factors and industry claims experience. A receivable for an insurance recovery is generally recognized when the loss has occurred and collection is considered probable (see Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies).\nFair value of Financial Instruments\nIn evaluating the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, GAAP outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and a reporting entitys own assumptions about market data (unobservable inputs). Fair value is defined as the price at which an orderly transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (that is, an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability).\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe following hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value should maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available:\nLevel 1\tQuoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement dates.\nLevel 2\tSignificant observable inputs that are used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources.\nLevel 3\tSignificant unobservable inputs the Company believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available.\nThe carrying amounts shown for the Companys cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of those instruments. The valuation is based on settlements of similar financial instruments, all of which are short-term in nature and are generally settled at or near cost. See Note 9 Long-term Debt and Note 10 Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments for other financial instruments subject to fair value estimates.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Companys objective in entering into derivative transactions is to manage its exposure to interest rate movements associated with its variable rate debt and changes in fuel prices. The Company recognizes derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value. Since all of the Companys derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges, the entire change in the fair value of the derivative included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is initially reported in Other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified to Interest expense (interest rate contracts) and Cost of services provided (fuel hedge contracts) in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations when the hedge transaction affects earnings. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if the hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, the amount recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is released to earnings. See Note 10 Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments for more information.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Companys revenue is generated from Maintenance Services and Development Services. The Company generally recognizes revenue from the sale of services as the services are performed, which is typically ratably over the term of the contract(s), which the Company believes to be the best measure of progress. The Company recognizes revenues as it transfers control of services to its customers in an amount reflecting the total consideration it expects to receive from the customer.\nRevenue is recognized according to the following five step model: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenues when a performance obligation is satisfied. The Company determined that for contracts containing multiple performance obligations, stand-alone selling price is readily determinable for each performance obligation. The transaction price will include estimates of variable consideration, such as returns and provisions for doubtful accounts and sales incentives, to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognized will not occur. In all cases, when a sale is recorded by the Company, no significant uncertainty exists surrounding the purchasers obligation to pay.\nRevenue for landscape maintenance and snow removal services under fixed fee models is recognized over time using an output based method. Additionally, a portion of the Companys recurring fixed fee landscape maintenance and snow removal services are recorded under the series guidance. The right to invoice practical expedient is generally applied to revenue related to per occurrence contracts as well as enhancement services. When the practical expedient is not applied, revenue is recognized using a cost-to-cost input method. Fees for contracted landscape maintenance services are typically billed on an equal monthly basis. Fees for fixed fee snow removal services are typically billed on an equal monthly basis during snow season, while fees for time and material or other activity-based snow removal services are typically billed as the services are performed. Fees for enhancement services are typically billed as the services are performed.\nFor Development Services, revenue is primarily recognized over time using the cost-to-cost input method, measured by the percentage of cost incurred to date to the estimated total cost for each contract. The full amount of anticipated losses on contracts is recorded as soon as such losses can be estimated. Changes in job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability, including final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and revenue and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.\nWhen contract revenue is recognized in excess of the amount the Company has invoiced or has the right to invoice, a contract asset is recognized. Contract assets are transferred to Accounts receivable, net when the rights to the consideration become unconditional. Contract assets are presented as Unbilled revenue on the consolidated balance sheets.\nContract liabilities consist of consideration that is contractually due from customers, or payments thereof, in advance of providing the product or performing services such that control has not passed to the customer. Contract liabilities are presented as Deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets.\nCost of Services Provided\nCost of services provided represents the cost of labor, subcontractors, materials, vehicle and equipment costs (including depreciation, fuel and maintenance) and other costs directly associated with revenue generating activities. These costs are expensed as incurred.\nLeases\nThe Company leases office space, branch locations, vehicles, and operating equipment. Lease agreements are evaluated to determine whether they are finance or operating leases. When substantially all of the risks and benefits of property ownership have been transferred to the Company, the lease then qualifies as a finance lease.\nFinance leases are capitalized at the lower of net present value of the total amount of rent payable under the leasing agreement (utilizing the implicit borrowing rate of the Company, as applicable) or the fair market value of the leased asset. Finance lease assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, over a period consistent with the Companys normal depreciation policy for property and equipment, but not exceeding the lease term. Interest charges are expensed over the period of the lease in relation to the carrying value of the finance lease obligation.\nEquity-based Compensation\nThe Companys equity-based compensation consists of stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance stock units. The Company expenses equity-based compensation using the estimated fair value as of the grant date over the requisite service or performance period applicable to the grant. Estimates of future forfeitures are made at the date of grant and revised, if necessary, in later periods if subsequent information indicates actual forfeitures will differ from those estimates. See Note 13 Equity Based Compensation for more information.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws for the taxable years in which those differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for the estimated future tax effects of deductible temporary differences and tax operating loss carryovers. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nThe Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Such tax positions are, based solely on their technical merits, more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities and reflect the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income tax expense and benefit.\nReclassification\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The change in inventories is now reflected within the change in other operating assets, as opposed to being presented as a separate financial statement caption. There was no impact to the Company's financial position as a result of this reclassification.\n3.\tRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nMeasurement of Credit Losses\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurements of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which was amended in May 2019 by ASU No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments and ASU No. 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief. These ASUs require entities to account for expected credit losses on financial instruments including trade receivables. The Company adopted the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nFair Value Measurement\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement which modifies the disclosures on fair value measurements by removing the requirement to disclose the amount and reason for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the policy for timing of such transfers. The ASU expands the disclosure requirements for Level 3 fair value measurements, primarily focused on changes in unrealized gains and losses included in Other comprehensive income. The Company adopted the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The adoption of ASU No. 2018-13 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nSimplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes which removes specified exceptions and adds requirements to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The Company adopted the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nReference Rate Reform\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting which provides optional expedients and exceptions for the accounting for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The guidance is effective for the Company upon issuance through December 31, 2022. The guidance in ASU 2020-04 is optional and may be elected over time as reference rate reform activities occur. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the Company elected to apply the hedge accounting expedients related to probability and the assessments of effectiveness for future LIBOR-indexed cash flows to assume that the index upon which future hedged transactions will be based matches the index on the corresponding derivatives. Application of these expedients preserves the presentation of derivatives consistent with past presentation. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01 to clarify the scope of certain optional expedients for derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the guidance on its consolidated financial statements and may apply other elections as applicable as additional changes in the market occur.\nBusiness Combinations\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers which requires that an entity (acquirer) recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606 as if it had originated the contracts. The guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n4.\tRevenue\nThe Companys revenue is generated from Maintenance Services and Development Services. The Company generally recognizes revenue from the sale of services as the services are performed, typically ratably over the term of the contract(s), which the Company believes to be the best measure of progress. The Company recognizes revenues as it transfers control of products and services to its customers. The Company recognizes revenue in an amount reflecting the total consideration it expects to receive from the customer. Revenue is recognized according to the following five step model: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenues when a performance obligation is satisfied. The Company determined that for contracts containing multiple performance obligations, stand-alone selling price is readily determinable for each performance obligation and therefore allocation of the transaction price to multiple performance obligations is not necessary. The transaction price will include estimates of variable consideration, such as returns and provisions for doubtful accounts and sales incentives, to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognized will not occur. In all cases, when a sale is recorded by the Company, no significant uncertainty exists surrounding the purchasers obligation to pay.\nMaintenance Services\nThe Companys Maintenance Services revenues are generated primarily through landscape maintenance services and snow removal services. Landscape maintenance services that are primarily viewed as non-discretionary, such as lawn care, mowing, gardening, mulching, leaf removal, irrigation and tree care, are provided under recurring annual contracts, which typically range from one to three years in duration and are generally cancellable by the customer with 30-90 days notice. Snow removal services are provided on either fixed fee based contracts or per occurrence contracts. Both landscape maintenance services and snow removal services can also include enhancement services that represent supplemental maintenance or improvement services generally provided under contracts of short duration related to specific services. Revenue for landscape maintenance and snow removal services under fixed fee models is recognized over time using an output based method. Additionally, a portion of the Companys recurring fixed fee landscape maintenance and snow removal services are recorded under the series guidance. The right to invoice practical expedient, defined below, is generally applied to revenue related to landscape maintenance and snow removal services performed in relation to per occurrence contracts as well as enhancement services. When use of the practical expedient is not appropriate for these contracts, revenue is recognized using a cost-to-cost input method. Fees for contracted landscape maintenance services are typically billed on an equal monthly basis. Fees for fixed fee snow removal services are typically billed on an equal monthly basis during snow season, while fees for time and material or other activity-based snow removal services are typically billed as the services are performed. Fees for enhancement services are typically billed as the services are performed.\nDevelopment Services\nDevelopment Services revenues are generated primarily through landscape architecture and development services. These revenues are primarily recognized over time using the cost-to-cost input method, measured by the percentage of cost incurred to date to the estimated total cost for each contract, which we believe to be the best measure of progress. The full amount of anticipated losses on contracts is recorded as soon as such losses can be estimated. These losses are immaterial to current and historical operations. Changes\nin job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability, including final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and revenue and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.\nDisaggregation of revenue\nThe following table presents the Companys reportable segment revenues, disaggregated by revenue type. The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers into major services lines. The Company has determined that disaggregating revenue into these categories depicts how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. As noted in the business segment reporting information in Note 15 Segments, the Companys reportable segments are Maintenance Services and Development Services.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\nLandscape Maintenance\n$\n1,825.7\n$\n1,698.0\n$\n1,566.3\nSnow Removal\n256.3\n284.9\n163.1\nMaintenance Services\n2,082.0\n1,982.9\n1,729.4\nDevelopment Services\n698.8\n574.9\n620.3\nEliminations\n(6.2\n)\n(4.2\n)\n(3.7\n)\nNet service revenues\n$\n2,774.6\n$\n2,553.6\n$\n2,346.0\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations represent the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations which are fully or partially unsatisfied at the end of the period.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the estimated future revenues for remaining performance obligations that are part of a contract that has an original expected duration of greater than one year was approximately $414.4 million. The Company expects to recognize revenue on 55% of the remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months and an additional 45% over the 12 months thereafter.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nWhen a contract results in revenue being recognized in excess of the amount the Company has invoiced or has the right to invoice to the customer, a contract asset is recognized. Contract assets are transferred to Accounts receivable, net when the rights to the consideration become unconditional. Contract assets are presented as Unbilled revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThere were $176.9 of amounts billed during the period and $195.9 of additions to our unbilled revenue balance during the twelve month period ended September 30, 2022.\nContract liabilities consist of payments received from customers, or such consideration that is contractually due, in advance of providing the product or performing services such that control has not passed to the customer. Contract liabilities are presented as Deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nChanges in Deferred revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 were as follows:\nDeferred Revenue\nBalance, September 30, 2021\n$\n48.2\nRecognition of revenue\n(1,119.0\n)\nDeferral of revenue\n1,130.1\nBalance, September 30, 2022\n$\n59.3\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\nThe Company offers certain interest-free contracts to customers where payments are received over a period not exceeding one year. Additionally, certain Maintenance Services and Development Services customers may pay in advance for services. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of these financing components. At contract inception, the period of time between the performance of services and the customer payment is one year or less.\nAs permitted under the practical expedient available under ASU No. 2014-09, the Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, (ii) contracts with variable consideration that is allocated entirely to unsatisfied performance obligations or to a wholly unsatisfied promise accounted for under the series guidance and (iii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount which we have the right to invoice for services performed.\n5.\tAccounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable of $397.6 and $378.9, is net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $4.0 and $3.2 and includes amounts of retention on incomplete projects to be completed within one year of $48.8 and $43.4 at September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively.\n6.\tProperty and Equipment, net\nProperty and equipment, net consists of the following:\nUseful\nLife\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nLand\n-\n$\n43.3\n$\n42.2\nBuildings and leasehold improvements\n2-40 yrs.\n46.3\n38.6\nOperating equipment\n2-7 yrs.\n302.4\n239.1\nTransportation vehicles\n3-7 yrs.\n339.8\n288.4\nOffice equipment and software\n3-10 yrs.\n75.1\n74.3\nConstruction in progress\n-\n5.7\n4.1\nProperty and equipment\n812.6\n686.7\nLess: Accumulated depreciation\n484.3\n422.3\nProperty and equipment, net\n$\n328.3\n$\n264.4\nConstruction in progress includes costs incurred for software and other assets that have not yet been placed in service.

Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $51.5, $52.3 and $55.8 for the years ended September 30, 2022, September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of which the reasonableness is continually evaluated by the Company. The weighted average amortization periods of intangible assets acquired during the years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 were seven years.\nIntangible assets as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nUseful\nLife\nGross\nCarrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nGross\nCarrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nCustomer relationships\n6-21 yrs.\n$\n723.1\n$\n(550.5\n)\n$\n694.9\n$\n(499.8\n)\nTrademarks\n12 yrs.\n3.8\n(2.6\n)\n3.8\n(2.3\n)\nNon-compete agreements\n5 yrs.\n2.7\n(2.2\n)\n2.7\n(1.7\n)\nTotal intangible assets\n$\n729.6\n$\n(555.3\n)\n$\n701.4\n$\n(503.8\n)\nAmortization expense is anticipated to be as follows in future years:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n$\n44.2\n35.4\n29.1\n21.7\n14.9\n2028 and thereafter\n29.0\n$\n174.3\nGoodwill\nThe following is a summary of the goodwill activity for the periods ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2022:\nMaintenance\nServices\nDevelopment\nServices\nTotal\nBalance, September 30, 2020\n1,680.4\n178.9\n1,859.3\nAcquisitions\n77.6\n13.9\n91.5\nBalance, September 30, 2021\n$\n1,758.0\n$\n192.8\n$\n1,950.8\nAcquisitions (1)\n34.7\n23.3\n58.0\nBalance, September 30, 2022\n$\n1,792.7\n$\n216.1\n$\n2,008.8\n(1)The acquisitions adjustment includes the immaterial impact of foreign currency adjustments during the period.\nThe Company performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of July 1, 2022 utilizing a quantitative test approach as described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nAcquisitions\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company acquired, through a series of separate transactions, 100% of the operations of eight unrelated companies, one of which was allocated between both Maintenance Services and Development Services. The Company paid approximately $93.1 in aggregate consideration for the acquisitions, net of cash acquired. The Company accounted for the business combinations under the acquisition method and, accordingly, recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair market values based on managements preliminary estimates, with the excess allocated to goodwill. The fair values were primarily estimated using Level 3 assumptions within the fair value hierarchy, including estimated future cash flows, discount rates and other factors. The valuation process to determine fair values is not yet complete. The Company continues to refine the valuation data and estimates primarily related to unbilled revenue, property and equipment, intangible assets, net, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and deferred revenue and will finalize the amounts recognized as it obtains the information necessary to complete the analysis, but no later than one year from the acquisition date. The identifiable assets acquired were primarily customer relationship intangible assets of $25.4. The amount allocated to goodwill is reflective of the benefits the Company expects to realize from anticipated synergies and the acquired workforce in place. The Company expects a portion of the goodwill resulting from these acquisitions will be deductible for tax purposes.\nFrom each acquisition date through September 30, 2022, the amount of revenue of the companies acquired during fiscal 2022 included in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2022, was $65.5.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company acquired, through a series of separate transactions, 100% of the operations of eight unrelated companies, of which three were allocated between both Maintenance Services and Development Services. The Company paid approximately $110.4 in consideration for the acquisitions, net of cash acquired. The Company accounted for the business combinations under the acquisition method and, accordingly, recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair market values based on managements preliminary estimates, with the excess allocated to goodwill. The purchase accounting related to the 2021 acquisitions was finalized during 2022. As a result of the final purchase accounting, certain of the fair value amounts previously estimated were adjusted during the measurement period. These measurement period adjustments resulted from updated valuation reports and appraisals received from our external valuation specialists, as well as revisions to internal estimates. The measurement period adjustments were not material to the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. The fair values were primarily estimated using Level 3 assumptions within the fair value hierarchy, including estimated future cash flows, discount rates and other factors. The valuation process to determine fair values is not yet complete. The identifiable assets acquired were primarily intangible assets, including customer relationships of $28.6. The amount allocated to goodwill is reflective of the benefits the Company expects to realize from anticipated synergies and the acquired assembled workforce. A portion of the goodwill resulting from these acquisitions is deductible for tax purposes.\n8.\tAccrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following as of:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nPayroll related accruals\n$\n46.0\n$\n70.2\nAccrued operating expenses\n91.2\n84.0\nOther accruals (a)\n56.3\n66.7\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n$\n193.5\n$\n220.9\n(a)Other accruals for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 include the Companys deferral of Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) payroll tax under the CARES Act.\n9.\tLong-term Debt\nLong-term debt consists of the following:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nSeries B term loan\n$\n1,185.3\n$\n1,001.7\nReceivables financing agreement\n168.0\n150.4\nFinancing costs, net\n(10.6\n)\n(11.1\n)\nTotal debt, net\n1,342.7\n1,141.0\nLess: Current portion of long-term debt\n12.0\n10.4\nLong-term debt, net\n$\n1,330.7\n$\n1,130.6\nFirst Lien credit facility term loans and Series B Term Loan due 2029\nIn connection with the KKR Acquisition, the Company and a group of financial institutions entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) dated December 18, 2013. The Credit Agreement consisted of seven-year $1,460.0 term loans (First Lien Term Loans) and a five-year $210.0 revolving credit facility. All amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement were collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Company.\nOn April 22, 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 6 to the Credit Agreement (the Amendment Agreement). Under the terms of the Amendment Agreement, the existing Credit Agreement (as amended prior to but not including under the Amendment Agreement, the Amended Credit Agreement) was amended to provide for: (i) a $1,200.0 seven-year term loan (the Series B Term Loan) and (ii) a $300.0 five-year revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility). The Series B Term Loan matures on April 22, 2029 and bears interest at a rate per annum of a secured overnight financing rate (Term SOFR), plus a margin of either 3.25% or 3.00% or a base rate (ABR) plus a margin of either 2.25% or 2.00%, subject to SOFR and ABR floors of 0.50% and 1.50%, respectively, with the margin on the Series B Term Loan determined based on the Companys first lien net leverage ratio. The Company used the net proceeds from the Series B Term Loan to repay all amounts outstanding under the Companys Amended Credit Agreement. As a result of the repayment of the amounts outstanding under the Company's Amended Credit Agreement, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $12.6 due to accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees and original issue discount included in the Other (expense) income line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. An original issue discount of $12.0 was incurred when the Series B Term Loan was issued and is being amortized using the effective interest method over the life of the debt, resulting in an effective yield of 3.42%. Debt repayments for the Series B Term Loan totaled $1,006.3 and $10.4 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively.\nIn addition to scheduled payments, the Company is obligated to pay a percentage of excess cash flow, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, as payments to principal. The percentage varies with the ratio of the Companys debt to its cash flow. The excess cash flow calculation did not result in any accelerated payment due for the periods ended September 30, 2022, September 30, 2021, and September 30, 2020.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement restricts the Companys ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens, enter into mergers and acquisitions, dispose of assets and make distributions to its Parent without the approval of the lenders. In certain circumstances, under the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company is prohibited from making certain restricted payments, including dividends or distributions to its stockholders, subject to certain exceptions set forth in that agreement (including an exception for the making of such restricted payments up to an agreed limit, which limit is determined by a formula that takes into account consolidated net income, net cash proceeds and other amounts, in each case as described in greater detail in that agreement). The Amended Credit Agreement imposes financial covenants upon the Company with respect to leverage and interest coverage under certain circumstances. The Amended Credit Agreement contains provisions permitting the bank to accelerate the repayment of the outstanding debt under this agreement upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, including a material adverse change in the financial condition of the Company since the date of the Amended Credit Agreement.\nThe weighted average interest rate on the Series B Term Loan was 3.76% and 2.65% for the years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. The Series B Term Loan has required amortization debt repayments that are due in quarterly installments of 0.25% of the original principal balance of the Series B Term Loans.\nRevolving credit facility\nThe Company has a five-year $300 revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) that matures on April 22, 2027 and bears interest at a rate per annum of Term SOFR plus a margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.50%, or ABR plus a margin ranging from 1.00\nto 1.50%, subject to SOFR and ABR floors of 0.00% and 1.00%, respectively, with the margin on the Revolving Credit Facility determined based on the Companys first lien net leverage ratio. The Revolving Credit Facility replaced the previous $260.0 revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement. The Company had no outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. There were $165.0 borrowings under the facility during the year ended September 30, 2022, of which, $165.0 were repaid during the same period. There were no borrowings or repayments under the facility for the year ended September 30, 2021. There is a quarterly commitment fee equal to either 1\u20444 of 1% or 3/8 of 1% of the unused balance of the Revolving Credit Facility depending on the Companys first lien net leverage ratio. The Company had $49.1 and $52.3 of letters of credits issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility was 2.3% for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nReceivables financing agreement\nOn April 28, 2017, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a receivables financing agreement (the Receivables Financing Agreement). On February 19, 2021, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Receivables Financing Agreement (the \"Second Amendment\") which extended the term through February 20, 2024 and increased the borrowing capacity to $235.0 through September 20, 2021 and $250.0 thereafter. On June 22, 2022, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the Receivables Financing Agreement (the \"Third Amendment\") which extended the term through June 22, 2025 and increased the borrowing capacity to $275.0. All amounts outstanding under the Receivables Financing Agreement are collateralized by substantially all of the accounts receivable and unbilled revenue of the Company. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company borrowed $392.0 against the capacity and voluntarily repaid $374.4. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company borrowed $34.5 against the capacity and voluntarily repaid $24.6.\nThe interest rate on the amounts borrowed under the Receivables Financing Agreement is established for periods of up to six months at 140-170 bps over SOFR depending on the Companys leverage ratio, and a commitment fee equal to 0.4% of the unused balance of the facility. The weighted average interest rate on the amounts borrowed under the Receivables Financing Agreement was 2.4% and 1.6% for the years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively.\nThe following are the scheduled maturities of long-term debt for the next five fiscal years and thereafter, which do not include any estimated excess cash flow payments:\nSeptember 30,\n$\n12.0\n12.0\n180.0\n12.0\n2027 and thereafter\n1,149.0\nTotal long term debt\n$\n1,365.0\nLess: Current maturities\n12.0\nLess: Original issue discount\n11.7\nLess: Financing costs\n10.6\nTotal long term debt, net\n$\n1,330.7\nThe Company has estimated the fair value of its long-term debt to be approximately $1,317.1 and $1,148.7 as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. Fair value is based on market bid prices around period-end (Level 2 inputs).\n10.\tFair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price at which an orderly transaction to sell an asset or to transfer a liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (that is, an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability).\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe following hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value should maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available:\nLevel 1\tQuoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement dates.\nLevel 2\tSignificant observable inputs that are used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources.\nLevel 3\tSignificant unobservable inputs the Company believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available.\nThe carrying amounts shown for the Companys cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of those instruments. The valuation is based on settlements of similar financial instruments all of which are short-term in nature and are generally settled at or near cost.\nInvestments held in Rabbi Trust\nA non-qualified deferred compensation plan is available to certain executives. Under this plan, participants may elect to defer up to 70% of their compensation. The Company invests the deferrals in participant-selected diversified investments that are held in a Rabbi Trust and which are classified within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the investments held in the Rabbi Trust is based on the quoted market prices of the underlying mutual fund investments. These investments are based on the participants selected investments, which represent the underlying liabilities to the participants in the non-qualified deferred compensation plan. Gains and losses on these investments are included in Other expense (income) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDerivatives\nThe Companys objective in entering into derivative transactions is to manage its exposure to interest rate movements associated with its variable rate debt and changes in fuel prices. The Company recognizes derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value. The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis based on the expected cash flows of each derivative. Although the Company has determined that the significant inputs, such as interest yield curve and discount rate, used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with the Companys counterparties and its own credit risk utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. However, as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following table summarizes the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nCarrying Value\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nOther assets:\nInvestments held by Rabbi Trust\n$\n10.6\n$\n10.6\n$\n-\n$\n-\nInterest rate swap contracts\n3.0\n-\n3.0\n-\nTotal Assets\n$\n13.6\n$\n10.6\n$\n3.0\n$\n-\nOther liabilities:\nObligation to Rabbi Trust\n$\n10.6\n$\n10.6\n$\n-\n$\n-\nTotal Liabilities\n$\n10.6\n$\n10.6\n$\n-\n$\n-\nSeptember 30, 2021\nCarrying Value\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nOther assets:\nInvestments held by Rabbi Trust\n$\n13.5\n$\n13.5\n$\n-\n$\n-\nFuel hedges\n1.2\n-\n1.2\n-\nTotal Assets\n$\n14.7\n$\n13.5\n$\n1.2\n$\n-\nOther liabilities:\nInterest rate swap contracts\n$\n3.6\n$\n-\n$\n3.6\n$\n-\nObligation to Rabbi Trust\n13.5\n13.5\n-\n-\nTotal Liabilities\n$\n17.1\n$\n13.5\n$\n3.6\n$\n-\nHedging Activities\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, the Companys outstanding derivatives qualify as cash flow hedges. The Company assesses whether derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flow of the\nhedged forecasted transactions. Regression analysis is used for the hedge relationships and high effectiveness is achieved when a statistically valid relationship reflects a high degree of offset and correlation between the fair values of the derivative and the hedged forecasted transaction. The entire change in the fair value for highly effective derivatives is reported in Other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into Interest expense (in the case of interest rate contracts) and Cost of services provided (in the case of fuel hedge contracts) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the hedged item affects earnings. If the hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, then the amount recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss is released to earnings. Cash flows from the derivatives are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the underlying hedged transaction.\nInterest Rate Swap Contracts\nThe Company has exposures to variability in interest rates associated with its variable interest rate debt, which includes the Series B Term Loan. As such, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to help manage interest rate exposure by economically converting a portion of its variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt effective for the periods March 18, 2016 through December 31, 2022. The notional amount of interest rate contracts was $500.0 at September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. The net deferred gain on the interest rate swaps as of September 30, 2022 of $2.2, net of taxes, are expected to be recognized in Interest expense over the next 12 months.\nThe effects on the consolidated financial statements of the interest rate swaps which were designated as cash flow hedges were as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nIncome (loss) recognized in Other comprehensive income\n$\n6.1\n$\n(0.6\n)\n$\n(10.3\n)\nNet loss reclassified from Accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss into Interest expense\n(0.5\n)\n(6.8\n)\n(16.9\n)\nFuel Swap Contracts\nThe Company has exposures to variability in fuel pricing associated with its purchase and usage of fuel during the ordinary course of business operating a large fleet of vehicles and equipment. As such, the Company entered into gasoline hedge contracts to help reduce its exposure to volatility in the fuel markets. As of September 30, 2022, no fuel hedge contracts were outstanding\nThe effects on the consolidated financial statements of the fuel swaps which were designated as cash flow hedges were as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nIncome (loss) recognized in Other comprehensive\nincome (loss)\n$\n0.2\n$\n3.5\n$\n(2.7\n)\nNet gain (loss) reclassified from Accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss into Cost of services provided\n1.5\n2.3\n(2.4\n)\n11.\tIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws for the taxable years in which those differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for the estimated future tax effects of deductible temporary differences and tax operating loss carryovers. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more-likely-than-not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nThe components of income tax expense (benefit) are as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$\n7.5\n$\n(28.1\n)\n$\n12.5\nState\n4.7\n3.8\n5.0\nDeferred:\nFederal\n(3.7\n)\n28.4\n(19.6\n)\nState\n(2.9\n)\n0.5\n(7.5\n)\nTotal income tax (benefit) expense\n$\n5.6\n$\n4.6\n$\n(9.6\n)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount computed at the federal statutory corporate tax rate as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nFederal tax at statutory rate\n$\n4.1\n$\n10.7\n$\n(10.8\n)\nState tax, net of federal tax (benefit) expense\n1.2\n3.6\n(2.5\n)\nTax effect of:\nEquity-based compensation\n0.6\n1.2\n1.5\nNon-deductible officers compensation\n0.7\n-\n-\nProvision to return and deferred tax adjustments\n(0.3\n)\n(0.6\n)\n(0.7\n)\nNon-deductible promotional and entertainment expense\n0.4\n0.6\n0.6\nGoodwill impairment\n-\n-\n3.3\nFuel tax credit and other credits\n(0.8\n)\n(0.8\n)\n(0.8\n)\nChange in uncertain tax positions\n-\n-\n(0.1\n)\nCarryback claim, net of adjustments\n(0.3\n)\n(10.1\n)\n-\nOther, net\n-\n-\n(0.1\n)\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n$\n5.6\n$\n4.6\n$\n(9.6\n)\nThe components of the Companys net deferred tax asset and liability accounts resulting from temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities are as follows:\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nDeferred tax assets:\nInterest rate swaps\n$\n-\n$\n1.4\nSelf-insurance reserves\n30.7\n29.6\nDeferred compensation\n3.0\n2.7\nPayroll related accruals\n19.7\n18.3\nOther accrued expenses\n5.4\n1.8\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\n1.0\n0.8\nLease liabilities\n22.6\n17.7\nNet operating loss carryforward\n8.5\n11.2\nOther non-current deferred tax assets\n3.3\n1.8\nTotal non-current deferred tax assets\n94.2\n85.3\nValuation allowance\n-\n-\nTotal deferred tax assets\n$\n94.2\n$\n85.3\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nIntangible assets\n$\n47.0\n$\n49.0\nProperty and equipment\n78.5\n79.0\nDeferred revenue\n10.6\n8.7\nPrepaid assets\n0.2\n0.4\nLease assets\n20.9\n15.9\nOther non-current deferred tax liabilities\n0.2\n0.5\nTotal non-current deferred tax liabilities\n157.4\n153.5\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n$\n63.2\n$\n68.2\nClassification on balance sheets:\nOther Assets\n$\n5.4\n$\n2.6\nDeferred Tax Liabilities\n68.6\n70.8\nThe CARES Act\nIn March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) was signed into law and included various provisions to provide additional economic relief to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Notable provisions included net operating loss carrybacks, adjustments to the interest expense limitations under the U.S Tax Code Section 163(j), increase in the charitable contributions limitation, payroll tax deferrals of the employer portion of social security tax, a portion of which was repaid during the year ended September 30, 2022 and the remainder of which will be repaid in fiscal year 2023, and an employee retention\ncredit for wages paid to an idle employee under certain circumstances resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company recorded a tax receivable of $39.0 and a benefit of $10.1 to the tax provision for the tax net operating losses incurred in 2021 from the enactment of the CARES Act, net of adjustments. The tax net operating losses have been carried back to prior years. Further, the Company previously elected to defer the employer portion of social security taxes through 2020 and has filed for the employee retention credit allowed for under the CARES Act. The Company recorded a tax credit of $3.3 related to the employee retention credit.\nNet Operating Losses\nThe Company has state income tax net operating losses of $157.4 having varying expirations from fiscal year 2023 through an indefinite useful life. The Company believes it is more likely than not it will be able to utilize all losses to offset future income.\nUncertain Income Tax Positions\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the Company's effective tax rate. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change within the next twelve months for a number of reasons including audit settlements, tax examination activities and the recognition and measurement considerations under this guidance.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and local jurisdictions. The Companys returns are no longer subject to U.S. federal and state tax examination for years before 2019 and 2017, respectively.\n12.\tLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at the inception of the agreement. The Company determines an arrangement is a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of the asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nThe Company has operating and finance leases for branch and administrative offices, vehicles, certain machinery and equipment, and furniture. The Companys leases have remaining lease terms from one month up to 11.3 years with one or more exercisable renewal periods and specified increases in lease payments upon exercise of the renewal options. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend the lease only when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise those options. Some leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage, output, or may vary for other reasons, such as insurance, common area maintenance, and tax payments. The variable lease payments are not presented as part of the initial right-of-use asset or lease liability. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material restrictive covenants or residual value guarantees.\nThe following table summarizes the lease-related assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nOperating leases:\nRight-of-use asset\n$\n81.6\n$\n69.5\nCurrent portion of lease liabilities\n26.8\n22.0\nLease liabilities\n61.3\n54.2\nTotal operating lease liabilities\n$\n88.1\n$\n76.2\nFinance leases:\nRight-of-use asset(1)\n$\n41.9\n$\n32.1\nCurrent portion of lease liabilities(2)\n19.3\n14.9\nLease liabilities(3)\n22.4\n12.7\nTotal finance lease liabilities\n$\n41.7\n$\n27.6\n(1)\tIncluded in Property and equipment, net in the consolidated balance sheets.\n(2)\tIncluded in Accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n(3)\tIncluded in Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAs most of the Companys leases do not specifically state an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate consistent with the lease term as of the lease commencement date when calculating the present value of remaining lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate reflects the cost to borrow on a securitized basis. The remaining lease term does not reflect all renewal options available to the Company, only those renewal options that the Company has assessed as reasonably certain.\nThe weighted-average remaining lease terms and incremental borrowing rates as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nOperating leases:\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\n4.6\n4.9\nWeighted-average incremental borrowing rate\n3.3\n%\n3.3\n%\nFinance leases:\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\n2.7\n2.7\nWeighted-average incremental borrowing rate\n2.8\n%\n3.3\n%\nThe components of lease cost for operating and finance leases for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nOperating lease cost\n$\n29.2\n$\n25.3\nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of right-of-use asset\n20.2\n17.1\nInterest on lease liabilities\n1.0\n0.8\nTotal finance lease cost\n21.2\n17.9\nShort-term lease cost\n22.0\n18.4\nVariable lease costs not included in lease liability\n2.9\n2.4\nSublease income\n(0.6\n)\n(0.5\n)\nTotal lease cost\n$\n74.7\n$\n63.5\nSupplemental cash flow information for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases\n$\n27.9\n$\n23.6\nOperating cash flows from finance leases\n1.0\n0.7\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases\n27.0\n20.5\nNon-cash items:\nRight-of-use Assets Obtained In Exchange For New Operating Liabilities\n39.6\n33.8\nRight-of-use Assets Obtained In Exchange For New Finance Liabilities\n33.3\n22.0\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company does not have material operating or financing leases that have not yet commenced.\nMaturities of operating and finance lease liabilities as of September 30, 2022 were as follows:\nFiscal Year\nOperating Lease\nFinance Lease\n$\n29.2\n$\n20.3\n22.6\n12.9\n15.1\n5.7\n11.0\n3.7\n6.3\n1.4\nThereafter\n11.7\n-\nTotal net lease payments\n95.9\n44.0\nLess: Amounts representing interest\n7.8\n2.3\nTotal lease liabilities\n88.1\n41.7\nLess: Current portion of lease liabilities\n(26.8\n)\n(19.3\n)\nNon-current lease liabilities\n$\n61.3\n$\n22.4\n13.\tEquity Based Compensation\nAmended and Restated 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan\nOn June 28, 2018 (and as amended and restated on March 10, 2020), in connection with the IPO, the Companys Board of Directors adopted, and its stockholders approved, the BrightView Holdings, Inc. 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan). The 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan provides that the total number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the plan is 18,650,000. Under the plan, the Company may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other equity-based awards and other cash-based awards to employees, directors, officers, consultants and advisors.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nA summary of the Companys restricted stock award activity for the year ended September 30, 2022 is presented in the following table:\nShares\nWeighted-Avg Distribution Price per Share\nOutstanding at September 30, 2021\n802,000\n$\n14.31\nLess: Redeemed\n235,000\n$\n14.10\nLess: Forfeited\n26,000\n$\n14.31\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022\n541,000\n$\n14.40\nRestricted Stock Units\nA summary of the Companys restricted stock unit activity for the year ended September 30, 2022 is presented in the following table:\nShares\nWeighted-Avg Distribution Price per Share\nOutstanding at September 30, 2021\n1,299,000\n$\n15.14\nGranted\n1,613,000\n$\n11.85\nLess: Vested\n428,000\n$\n15.33\nLess: Forfeited\n199,000\n$\n15.34\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022\n2,285,000\n$\n12.73\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company issued 1,613,000 restricted stock units (RSUs) at a weighted average grant date fair value of $11.85 per share, all of which are subject to vesting. The majority of these units vest ratably over a four-year period commencing on the grant date. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense associated with the new grants will total approximately $16.3 over the requisite service period.

Non-cash equity-based compensation expense associated with the grant will be approximately $4.7 over the requisite service period. During the year ended September 30, 2022, 1,000 options were exercised and 310,000 options were forfeited.\nPerformance Stock Unit Awards\nA summary of the Companys performance stock unit activity for the year ended September 30, 2022 is presented in the following table:\nShares\nWeighted-Avg Distribution Price per Share\nOutstanding at September 30, 2021\n-\n-\nGranted\n403,000\n$\n12.41\nLess: Vested\n-\n-\nLess: Forfeited\n-\n-\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022\n403,000\n$\n12.41\nOn May 17, 2022, the Company issued 403,000 performance stock units (PSUs) at a weighted average distribution price of $12.41 per share and a weighted average grant date fair value of $16.51 per share, which hold a service period of forty months and cliff vest at the end of the service period. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense associated with the grant will be approximately $6.7 over the requisite service period. During the year ended September 30, 2022, no PSUs vested or were forfeited.\nValuation Assumptions\nThe fair value of each restricted stock award, RSU, or PSU granted under the Plan and the 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan was estimated on the date of grant in accordance with the fair value provisions in ASC 718. The fair value of the RSU awards and stock option awards granted were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The Company chose the Black-Scholes-Merton model based on its experience with the model and the determination that the model could be used to provide a reasonable estimate of the fair value of awards with terms such as those discussed above. The fair value of the RSU awards and stock option awards are calculated based on a combination of the income and market multiple approaches. Under the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method, forecast cash flows are discounted to the present value at a risk-adjusted discount rate. The valuation analyses determine discrete free cash flows over several years based on the forecast financial information provided by management and a terminal value for the residual period beyond the discrete forecast, which are discounted at the appropriate rate to estimate the Companys enterprise value.\nFor PSU awards subject to a market condition, the metric is the Companys total shareholder return during the performance period relative to a pre-defined set of industry peer companies. The fair value of these awards is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation. For PSU awards subject to a performance condition, the metrics are the Company's compound annual growth rates of revenue and adjusted earnings per share. The fair value of these awards is determined based on the trading price of the companys common shares on the date of grant.\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation of RSU awards, restricted stock into which such awards were converted, PSU awards and stock option awards granted or modified for the years ended September 30, 2022, September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 are presented in the table below:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nAssumptions:\nRisk-free interest rate\n1.88\n%\n0.49\n%\n1.56\n%\nDividend yield\n-\n-\n-\nVolatility factor\n47.10\n%\n54.40\n%\n43.51\n%\nExpected term (in years)\n5.3\n6.4\n6.3\nRisk-free interest rate - The risk-free rate for RSU awards, restricted stock into which such Unit awards were converted, PSU awards and stock option awards granted during the periods presented above was determined by using the U.S. Treasury constant maturity rate as of the valuation date commensurate with the expected term.\nExpected dividend yield - No routine dividends are currently being paid by the Plan, or are expected to be paid in future periods.\nExpected volatility - The expected volatility is based upon an analysis of the historical and implied volatility of the guideline companies and adjusting the volatility to take into account the differences in leverage between the Company and the guideline companies.\nExpected term - The expected term represents the expected time to a liquidity event or re-capitalization. The Company estimated the expected life by considering historical exercise and termination behavior of employees and the vesting conditions of the RSUs, PSUs and stock option awards granted under the Plan.\nEquity-Based Compensation Expense\nThe Company recognizes equity-based compensation expense using the estimated fair value as of the grant date over the requisite service or performance period applicable to the grant. Estimates of future forfeitures are made at the date of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nThe Company recognized $18.9, $19.7 and $23.6 in equity-based compensation expense for the years ended September 30, 2022, September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively, included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The resulting charge increased Additional paid in capital by the same amount. Total unrecognized compensation cost was $36.2, $25.6 and $36.2 as of September 30, 2022, September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.3 years.\n2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Companys Stockholders have approved the Companys 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, (the ESPP). A total of 1,100,000 shares of the Companys common stock were made available for sale under the Companys 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan on October 22, 2018, of which 112,000, 120,000 and 172,000 were issued on November 15, 2021, November 14, 2020 and November 14, 2019, respectively. An additional portion thereof is expected to be issued in November 2022.\n14.\tCommitments and Contingencies\nRisk Management\nThe Company carries general liability, auto liability, workers compensation, professional liability, directors and officers liability, and employee health care insurance policies. In addition, the Company carries umbrella liability insurance policies to cover claims over the liability limits contained in the primary policies. The Companys insurance programs for workers compensation, general liability, auto liability and employee health care for certain employees contain self-insured retention amounts, deductibles and other coverage limits (self-insured liability). Claims that are not self-insured as well as claims in excess of the self-insured liability amounts are insured. The Company uses estimates in the determination of the required reserves. These estimates are based upon calculations performed by third-party actuaries, as well as examination of historical trends, and industry claims experience. The Companys reserve for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims under these programs at September 30, 2022 was $146.7, of which $45.6 was classified in current liabilities and $101.1 was classified in non-current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Companys reserve for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims under these programs at September 30, 2021 was $154.7, of which $50.2 was classified in current liabilities and $104.5 was classified in non-current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. While the ultimate amount of these claims is dependent on future developments, in managements opinion, recorded reserves are adequate to cover these claims. The Companys reserve for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims at September 30, 2022 includes\n$17.9 related to claims recoverable from third-party insurance carriers. Corresponding assets of $5.1 and $12.8 are recorded at September 30, 2022, as Other current assets and Other assets, respectively. The Companys reserve for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims at September 30, 2021 includes $30.5 related to claims recoverable from third party insurance carriers. Corresponding assets of $8.2 and $22.3 were recorded at September 30, 2021, as Other current assets and Other assets, respectively.\nLitigation Contingency\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of its business, principally claims made alleging injuries (including vehicle and general liability matters as well as workers' compensation and property casualty claims). Such claims, even if lacking merit, can result in expenditures of significant financial and managerial resources. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is also subject to claims involving current and/or former employees and disputes involving commercial and regulatory matters. Regulatory matters include, among other things, audits and reviews of local and federal tax compliance, safety and employment practices. Although the process of resolving regulatory matters and claims through litigation and other means is inherently uncertain, the Company is not aware of any such matter, legal proceeding or claim that it believes will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material effect on the Company, its financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows. For all legal matters, an estimated liability is established in accordance with the loss contingencies accounting guidance. This estimated liability is included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n15.\tSegments\nThe operations of the Company are conducted through two operating segments, Maintenance Services and Development Services, which are also its reportable segments.\nMaintenance Services primarily consists of recurring landscape maintenance services and snow removal services as well as supplemental landscape enhancement services.\nDevelopment Services primarily consists of landscape architecture and development services for new construction and large scale redesign projects.\nThe operating segments identified above are determined based on the services provided, and they reflect the manner in which operating results are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) to allocate resources and assess performance. The CODM is the Companys Chief Executive Officer. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Companys operating segments based upon Net Service Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA and Capital Expenditures. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate performance and profitability of each operating segment.\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Corporate includes corporate executive compensation, finance, legal and information technology which are not allocated to the segments. Eliminations represent eliminations of intersegment revenues. The Company does not currently provide asset information by segment, as this information is not used by management when allocating resources or evaluating performance.\nThe following is a summary of certain financial data for each of the segments:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nSeptember 30, 2020\nMaintenance Services\n$\n2,082.0\n$\n1,982.9\n$\n1,729.4\nDevelopment Services\n698.8\n574.9\n620.3\nEliminations\n(6.2\n)\n(4.2\n)\n(3.7\n)\nNet Service Revenues\n$\n2,774.6\n$\n2,553.6\n$\n2,346.0\nMaintenance Services\n$\n278.8\n$\n299.6\n$\n248.7\nDevelopment Services\n73.7\n65.2\n81.6\nCorporate\n(64.6\n)\n(62.5\n)\n(58.7\n)\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)\n$\n287.9\n$\n302.3\n$\n271.6\nMaintenance Services\n$\n82.9\n$\n52.4\n$\n40.6\nDevelopment Services\n12.5\n6.2\n9.4\nCorporate\n11.9\n2.6\n2.7\nCapital Expenditures\n$\n107.3\n$\n61.2\n$\n52.7\n(1)\tPresented below is a reconciliation of Net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nSeptember 30, 2020\nNet income (loss)\n$\n14.0\n$\n46.3\n$\n(41.6\n)\nInterest expense\n53.3\n42.3\n64.6\nIncome tax (benefit) provision\n5.6\n4.6\n(9.6\n)\nDepreciation expense\n98.9\n84.7\n80.5\nAmortization expense\n51.5\n52.3\n55.8\nEstablish public company financial reporting compliance (a)\n-\n-\n0.9\nBusiness transformation and integration costs (b)\n21.5\n28.5\n32.5\nOffering-related expenses (c)\n0.1\n0.6\n4.4\nEquity-based compensation (d)\n19.0\n20.0\n24.0\nCOVID-19 related expenses (e)\n11.4\n23.0\n13.8\nDebt extinguishment (f)\n12.6\n-\n-\nChanges in self-insured liability estimates (g)\n-\n-\n24.1\nSale of tree company (h)\n-\n-\n22.2\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n287.9\n$\n302.3\n$\n271.6\n(a)Represents costs incurred to establish public company financial reporting compliance, including costs to comply with the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley and the accelerated adoption of the revenue recognition standard (ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and other miscellaneous costs.\n(b)Business transformation and integration costs consist of (i) severance and related costs; (ii) business integration costs and (iii) information technology infrastructure, transformation costs, and other.\nFiscal Year Ended\n(in millions)\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nSeptember 30, 2020\nSeverance and related costs\n$\n1.6\n$\n0.3\n$\n3.8\nBusiness integration (i)\n8.2\n14.0\n13.4\nIT infrastructure, transformation, and other (j)\n11.7\n14.2\n15.3\nBusiness transformation and integration costs\n$\n21.5\n$\n28.5\n$\n32.5\n(c)Represents transaction related expenses incurred for IPO related litigation and completed or contemplated subsequent registration statements.\n(d)Represents equity-based compensation expense and related taxes recognized for equity incentive plans outstanding.\n(e)Represents expenses related to the Companys response to the COVID-19 pandemic, principally temporary and incremental salary and related expenses, personal protective equipment, cleaning and supply purchases, and other.
