    "content": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThere are many factors that may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, many of which are not within our control, including the following risks relating to: (1) the demand for our products and services and our ability to grow our customer base; (2) our business operations, including internal and external factors that may impact our operational continuity; (3) our international operations; (4) our supply chain and our ability to obtain and transport adequate quantities of LPG; (5) government regulation and oversight; and (6) general factors that may impact our business and our shareholders. Investors should carefully consider, together with the other information contained in this Report, the risks and uncertainties described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, also may materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. No priority or significance is intended by, nor should be attached to, the order in which the risk factors appear.\nRisks Relating to the Demand for Our Products and Services and Our Ability to Grow Our Customer Base\nOur business is seasonal and decreases in the demand for our energy products and services because of warmer-than-normal heating season weather or unfavorable weather conditions may adversely affect our results of operations. Because many of our customers rely on our energy products and services to heat their homes and businesses, and for agricultural purposes such as crop drying, our results of operations are adversely affected by warmer-than-normal heating season weather. Weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our energy products and services for both heating and agricultural purposes. Accordingly, the volume of our energy products sold is at its highest during the peak heating season of October through March and is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather. For example, historically, approximately 60% to 70% of AmeriGas Propanes annual retail propane volume, 60% to 70% of UGI Internationals annual retail LPG volume, 60% to 70% of Energy Services retail natural gas volume and 60% to 65% of PA Gas Utilitys natural gas throughput (the total volume of gas sold to or transported for customers within our distribution system) has typically been sold during these months. Additionally, as a result of the AmeriGas Merger, an even greater portion of our earnings has been and will continue to be derived during the peak heating season of October through March. There can be no assurance that normal winter weather in our market areas will occur in the future.\nIn addition, our agricultural customers use LPG for purposes other than heating, including for crop drying, and unfavorable weather conditions, such as lack of precipitation, may impact the demand for LPG. Moreover, harsh weather conditions may at times impede the transportation and delivery of LPG or restrict our ability to obtain LPG from suppliers. Spikes in demand caused by weather or other factors can stress the supply chain and limit our ability to obtain additional quantities of LPG. Changes in LPG supply costs are normally passed through to customers, but time lags (between when we purchase the LPG and when the customer purchases the LPG) may result in significant gross margin fluctuations that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe potential effects of climate change may affect our business, operations, supply chain and customers, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Shifts and fluctuations in weather patterns and other environmental conditions, including temperature and precipitation levels, may affect consumer demand for our energy products and services. In addition, the potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, could disrupt our operations and supply chain, and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to these effects. These or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or supply costs. Our commercial and residential customers may also experience the potential physical impacts of climate change and may incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to these efforts, including increasing the mix and resiliency of their energy solutions and supply, which may adversely impact their ability to pay for our products and services or decrease demand for our products and services. The impact of any one or all of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to the direct physical impact that climate change may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, we may also be adversely impacted by other environmental factors, including: (i) technological advances designed to promote energy efficiency and limit environmental impact; (ii) increased competition from alternative energy sources; (iii) regulatory responses aimed at decreasing GHG emissions; and (iv) litigation or regulatory actions that address the environmental impact of our energy products and services. For more information on these risks, please refer to the following risk factors included elsewhere in this section:\nEnergy efficiency and technology advances, as well as price induced customer conservation, may result in reduced demand for our energy products and services;\nOur operations may be adversely affected by competition from other energy sources;\nOur need to comply with, and respond to, industry-wide changes resulting from, comprehensive, complex, and sometimes unpredictable governmental regulations, including regulatory initiatives aimed at increasing competition within our industry, may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth, which may adversely affect our operating results;\nOur operations, financial results and cash flows may be adversely affected by existing and future global climate change laws and regulations, including with respect to GHG emission restrictions, as well as market responses thereto; and\nWe are subject to operating and litigation risks that may not be covered by insurance.\nOur potential to increase revenues may be affected by the decline in retail volumes of LPG and our ability to retain and grow our customer base. The retail LPG distribution industry in the U.S. and many of the European countries in which we operate is mature and has been declining over the past several years, with no or modest growth (or decline) in total demand foreseen in the near future. Accordingly, we expect that year-to-year industry volumes will be principally affected by weather patterns. Therefore, our ability to grow within the LPG industry is dependent on our ability to acquire other retail distributors and to achieve internal growth, which includes the continuation of the ACE, Cynch and National Accounts programs in the U.S. and expansion in Europe, as well as the success of our sales and marketing programs designed to attract and retain customers. Any failure to retain and grow our customer base and successfully acquire other distributors would have an adverse impact on our results.\nOur ability to grow our businesses will be adversely affected if we are not successful in identifying and completing business combinations, asset acquisitions or investments in joint ventures intended to advance our business strategy, or if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from such transactions we have completed. One element of our business strategy is to grow through investments in the U.S. and in international markets, which includes our recent efforts to expand our presence in the renewable energy industry. We may choose to finance such future investments with debt, equity, cash or a combination of the three. We can give no assurances that we will find attractive investment opportunities in the future (including renewable energy opportunities), that we will be able to complete and finance these transactions on economically acceptable terms, that any investments and related transactions will not be dilutive to earnings or that any additional debt incurred to finance such investment will not affect our ability to pay dividends. Moreover, certain investments and acquisitions in the U.S. and Europe may require merger control filings with the Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission, as applicable, and commitments (such as agreements not to compete for certain businesses) or divestments of assets may be required to obtain clearance. Such commitments or divestments may adversely influence the overall economics and risk profile of the contemplated transaction.\nTo the extent we are successful in executing these transactions, such transactions involve a number of risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, the assumption of material liabilities, environmental liabilities, the diversion of managements attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of acquired operations, difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees and difficulties in the assimilation of different cultures and practices and internal controls, challenges with consolidating the operations of acquired companies into our own, as well as in the assimilation of broad and geographically dispersed personnel and operations. Future investments could also result in, among other things, the failure to identify material issues during due diligence, the risk of overpaying for assets, unanticipated capital expenditures, the failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, recording goodwill and other intangible assets at values that ultimately may be subject to impairment charges and fluctuations in quarterly results. There can also be no assurance that our past and future investments, including our recent investments in renewable energy, will deliver the strategic, financial, operational and environmental benefits that we anticipate, nor can we be certain that strategic investments will remain available in the future.\nThe failure to successfully identify, complete, and implement business combinations, asset acquisitions and investments intended to advance our business strategy could have an adverse impact on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnergy efficiency and technology advances, as well as price induced customer conservation, may result in reduced demand for our energy products and services. The trend toward increased energy efficiency and technological advances, including installation of improved insulation and the development of more efficient boilers and increased consumer preference for alternative heating equipment installations, such as electric heat pumps, alongside concerted conservation measures, which have been exacerbated particularly in Europe by the evolving energy crisis, may reduce the demand for our energy products. Prices for LPG and natural gas are subject to volatile fluctuations as a result of changes in supply and demand as well as other market conditions. During periods of high energy commodity costs, our prices generally increase, which may lead to customer conservation and attrition. A reduction in demand could lower our revenues and, therefore, lower our net income and adversely affect our cash flows. In addition, federal, European and/or local laws and regulations may require mandatory conservation\nmeasures, which would reduce the demand for our energy products. In Europe, measures are underway to decarbonize the electric generation grid, as well as residential and commercial heating, in order to achieve EU climate change objectives, including a net zero goal by 2050. For example, in 2018 the EU revised the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (the EPBD) with the goal to create a clear path towards a low and zero-emission and decarbonized building stock in the EU by 2050. Updates to the EPBD continue to make their way through EU legislative approvals, which will establish stronger targets for management of new and existing building construction and integral heating systems that focus on low or zero carbon outcomes. Over time, these various measures will impact fossil fuel consumption in Europe and the demand for our energy products. We cannot predict the materiality of the effect of future conservation measures or the effect that any technological advances in heating, conservation, energy generation or other devices might have on our operations.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by competition from other energy sources. Our energy products and services face competition from other energy sources, some of which are less costly for equivalent energy value. In addition, we cannot predict the effect that the development of alternative energy sources might have on our operations.\nOur LPG distribution businesses compete for customers against suppliers of electricity, fuel oil and natural gas. Electricity is a major competitor of LPG but is generally more expensive than LPG on a Btu equivalent basis for space heating, water heating and cooking. However, in Europe and elsewhere, climate change policies favoring electricity from renewable energy sources or the use of electric-powered equipment, such as heat pumps in heating applications, may cause changes in current relative price relationships. Moreover, notwithstanding cost, the convenience and efficiency of electricity make it an attractive energy source for consumers and developers of new homes. Fuel oil, which is a major competitor to propane, is a less environmentally attractive energy source. Furnaces and appliances that burn LPG must be upgraded to run on fuel oil and vice versa, and, therefore, a conversion from one fuel to the other requires the installation of new equipment. Our customers generally have an incentive to switch to fuel oil only if fuel oil becomes significantly less expensive than LPG, and in multiple countries, the risk of conversion to fuel oil is diminishing due to regulations that prevent or disfavor the installation and/or use of fuel oil boilers or fuel oil for heating applications. Historically, most applications for LPG have generally not been competitive with natural gas in areas where natural gas pipelines already exist because natural gas was a significantly less expensive source of energy than LPG. However, as a result of the recent and ongoing energy crisis in Europe, the cost of LPG in many of our European markets is less than natural gas, which is driving a stronger demand for LPG applications. Nevertheless, the gradual expansion of natural gas distribution systems in our service areas may continue to result in the availability of natural gas in some areas that previously depended upon LPG resulting in lower demand for LPG.\nOur natural gas businesses in the U.S. compete primarily with electricity and fuel oil, and, to a lesser extent, with LPG and coal. Competition among these fuels is primarily a function of their comparative price and the relative cost and efficiency of fuel utilization equipment. There can be no assurance that our natural gas revenues will not be adversely affected by this competition.\nThe expansion, construction and development of our energy infrastructure assets subjects us to risks. We seek to grow our business through the expansion, construction and development of our energy infrastructure, including new pipelines, gathering systems, facilities and other assets. These projects are subject to state and federal regulatory oversight and require certain property rights, such as easements and rights-of-way from public and private owners, as well as regulatory approvals, including environmental and other permits and licenses. There is no assurance that we or our project partners, as applicable, will be able to obtain the necessary property rights, permits and licenses in a timely and cost-efficient manner, or at all, which may result in a delay or failure to complete a project. We may face opposition to the expansion, construction or development of new or existing pipelines, gathering systems, facilities or other assets from environmental groups, landowners, local groups and other advocates. This opposition could take many forms, including organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets, or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt, or delay the development or operation of our assets and business. Failure to complete any pending or future infrastructure project may have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we are able to successfully complete any pending or future infrastructure project, our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project or as anticipated during the lifespan of the project. As a result, there is the risk that new and expanded energy infrastructure may not achieve our expected investment returns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business Operations, Including Internal and External Factors that May Impact Our Operational Continuity\nOur efforts to create operational benefits and cost efficiencies through business transformation initiatives at our business units and various corporate services functions may be disruptive and adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations. We have made, and may continue to make, adjustments to our workforce in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, changes in strategy, acquisitions or other internal and external considerations. These adjustments may result in increased costs and temporarily reduced productivity, as well as a disruption in our ability to perform functions critical to our strategy, including, but not limited to, disruptions in customer service. Although the effects from such adjustments have not been material to date, the effects of such adjustments may be significant in connection with any current or future business transformation initiatives, or we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of any such initiatives or do so within the expected timeframe. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nBeginning in Fiscal 2020, we initiated a transformation project focused on our corporate support functions, including finance, human resources, procurement and information technology, that is designed to standardize processes and activities across our global platform, while leveraging the use of best practices and efficiencies between our businesses. This initiative is being coordinated across multiple support functions, each function being at a different stage of transformation, and is expected to be completed by the end of Fiscal 2023. If we are unable to deliver the strategic and financial benefits that we anticipate, the achievement of these benefits is delayed, or the volume and nature of change challenges our available resources, then our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage and execute our initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success. Any failure to do so, which could result from our inability to successfully execute organizational change and business transformation initiatives, unanticipated costs or charges, loss of key personnel, customer loss and other factors described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For further information on these initiatives, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Continuing Business Transformation Initiatives.\nOur information technology systems and those of our third-party vendors have been the target of cyber-security attacks in the past. If we are unable to protect our information technology systems against future service interruption, misappropriation of data, or breaches of security resulting from cyber-security attacks or other events, or if we encounter other unforeseen difficulties in the design, implementation or operation of our information technology systems, or if our third-party vendors or service providers experience compromises to their information technology systems, our operations could be disrupted, our business and reputation may suffer, and our internal controls could be adversely affected. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology systems, including the Internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities and to store sensitive data, including (i) intellectual property, (ii) our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and business partners, (iii) personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, and (iv) data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement, and supply chain activities. In addition, we rely on our information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements.\nCyber-security incidents have recently increased in both frequency and magnitude and have involved malicious software and attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, including ransomware attacks where a targets access to its information systems is blocked until a ransom has been paid. The White House and various regulators, including the SEC, have accordingly increased their focus on companies cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Despite our security measures, our technologies, systems, and networks have been and may continue to be the target of cyber-security attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. Due to increasingly sophisticated threat actors, we may be unable to detect, identify or prevent attacks, and even if detected, we may be unable to adequately stop, investigate or remediate our systems given the tools and techniques being used by threat actors to circumvent controls and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. Attacks and incidents may also occur due to malfeasance by employees or contractors, as well as human error as in the case of social engineering and phishing campaigns. A number of our employees currently work remotely; as a result, our cyber-security program may be less effective and information technology security may be less robust for those employees. Similarly, our third-party vendors or service providers have been impacted by cyber-security attacks and incidents and are subject to many, if not all, of the same risks and disruptions as described above. A loss of our information technology systems, or temporary interruptions in the operation of our information technology systems, or those of our third-party vendors or service providers, or any other misappropriation of data, or breaches of security could lead to investigations and fines or penalties, litigation, increased costs for compliance and for remediation or rebuilding of our systems, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation. In addition, a cyber-security attack could provide a cyber-intruder with the ability to control or alter our pipeline operations. Such an act could result in critical pipeline failures.\nThe efficient execution of our businesses is dependent upon the proper design, implementation and functioning of its current and future internal systems, such as the information technology systems that support our underlying business processes. Any significant failure or malfunction of such information technology systems may result in disruptions of our operations. In\naddition, the effectiveness of our internal controls could be adversely affected if we encounter unforeseen problems with respect to the operation of our information technology systems.\nMoreover, as cyber incidents increase in frequency and magnitude, we may be unable to obtain cyber-security insurance in amounts and on terms we view as adequate for our operations, including the agreement to certain indemnification provisions by our insurance providers.\nOur utility transmission and distribution systems, our non-utility midstream assets, and the assets of upstream interstate pipelines and other midstream providers may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse impact on our financial results. Our ability to manage operational risk with respect to utility distribution and transmission and non-utility midstream assets, and the availability of natural gas delivered by interstate natural gas pipelines and midstream gathering assets is critical to our financial results. We obtain our supply from local Marcellus and Utica Shale sources, as well as other trading points in the U.S. If we experience physical capacity constraints on one or more of the interstate or intrastate natural gas pipelines that supply our businesses, we may not be able to supply our customers, which could have an adverse impact on our financial results. Our businesses also face several risks, including the breakdown or failure of, or damage to, equipment or processes (especially due to severe weather or natural disasters), accidents and other factors, including as a result of overpressurization of or damage to natural gas pipelines. Operation of our transmission and distribution systems or our midstream assets below our expectations may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs, civil litigation and the risk of regulatory penalties.\nRisks Relating to Our International Operations\nOur international operations could be subject to increased risks, which may negatively affect our business results. We operate LPG distribution and energy marketing businesses in Europe through our subsidiaries. As a result, we face risks in conducting business abroad that we do not face domestically. Certain aspects inherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact our operating results, including:\ncosts and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating earnings, the threat of double taxation, and potential increases to corporate income taxes (including the proposed OECD framework that aims to reform international taxation rules with the goal of ensuring that multinational corporations pay adequate taxes in the jurisdictions in which they operate and other similar proposals);\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly the euro, which can affect demand for our products, increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability and reported results;\nnew or revised regulatory requirements, including European competition and carbon emission laws, that may adversely affect the terms of contracts with customers, including with respect to exclusive supply rights and usage restrictions, and stricter regulations applicable to the storage and handling of LPG;\nnew and inconsistently enforced industry regulatory requirements, which can have an adverse effect on our competitive position;\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\ndifficulties in enforcing contractual rights;\nlocal political and economic conditions as well as geopolitical conditions that could cause instability and adversely impact the global economy or specific markets, such as the war between Russia and Ukraine; and\npotential violations of federal regulatory requirements, including anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering law, economic sanctions, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and EU regulatory requirements, including the GDPR and Sapin II.\nIn particular, certain legal and regulatory risks are associated with international business operations. We are subject to various anti-corruption, economic sanctions and trade compliance laws, rules and regulations. For example, the U.S. government imposes restrictions and prohibitions on transactions in certain foreign countries, including restrictions directed at oil and gas activities in Russia. U.S. laws also prohibit the improper offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of money or anything of value to any foreign official or political party, or to any person, knowing that all or a portion of it will be used to influence a foreign official in his or her official duties or to secure an improper advantage. Ensuring compliance with all relevant laws, rules and regulations is a complex task. Violation of one or more of these laws, rules or regulations could lead to loss of import or export privileges, civil or criminal penalties for us or our employees, or potential reputational harm, which could have a material adverse impact on earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe European energy crisis may create LPG commodity supply challenges and could negatively impact our business results. The geopolitical situation in Europe during 2022 led to a sharp decrease in natural gas imports from Russia to Europe. This\ndecrease resulted in a significant increase in natural gas prices in Europe. In response to the significant price increase, refineries are substituting a portion of their natural gas refinery fuels with LPG, leading to a decrease in the availability of LPG in some areas of Europe as well as higher LPG costs. In addition, gas processing plants supplying the United Kingdom and Norway markets are injecting LPG into the natural gas grid, decreasing the overall supply of LPG from the gas processing plants. In this context, LPG supply patterns are substantially changing with increased reliance on sea-imports and land logistics.\nWe anticipate that the European energy crisis and the corresponding response by refineries and gas processing plants will continue in Fiscal 2023, which may lead to commodity supply challenges in some markets, higher commodity costs that may not be able to be absorbed by our customers, particularly in the United Kingdom and our Eastern European markets, and lower consumption by our customers, among other impacts, which could have a material adverse impact on our earnings, cash flows and overall financial condition.\nEconomic and geopolitical instability, including as a result of acts of war, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. In late February 2022, Russian military forces launched significant military action against Ukraine, which has continued through the date of this Report. We do not have operations in Russia or Ukraine. Nevertheless, the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting sanctions by U.S. and European governments, together with any additional future sanctions by them, could have a larger impact that expands into other geographies where we do business, including our supply chain, business partners and customers in those markets, which could result in lost sales, supply shortages, commodity price fluctuations, increased costs, transportation logistics challenges, customer credit and liquidity issues, and lost efficiencies. The acceleration of a global energy crisis, including as a result of restrictions on Russias energy exports, could similarly impact the geographies where we do business. In addition, the U.S. and Europe have commenced certain trade actions as a result of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which are expected to result in retaliatory measures or actions, including tariffs, by Russia. While significant uncertainty exists with respect to this matter, the war between Russia and Ukraine and its broader impacts, including any increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade imposed by the U.S. or Europe, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by Russia or other countries in response, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur energy marketing business in Europe may continue to be dramatically disrupted by extreme prices and volatility in the natural gas and power markets in Europe, which have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a material negative impact on our financial results. Our natural gas and power marketing businesses have traditionally relied upon stable price and availability conditions. The European energy markets have entered in an unprecedented state of volatility. In addition to the pre-existing natural gas supply shortages, the war between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting substantial reduction of natural gas imports from Russia to Europe have led to significant increases in the costs of both wholesale gas and power, and have created new risks that we have experienced and expect to continue to experience in Fiscal 2023 within our European energy marketing business. These risks include: (i) the ability to economically support the traditional fixed price and full requirement contracts of customers due to the significant increased cost to purchase incremental additional volumes consumed in excess of expectations; (ii) the ability to service typical portfolio needs with standard trading activities due to the limitations on purchasing cost effective services in the market; (iii) the ability to pass increased costs onto customers due, among other things, to timing, regulatory and contractual constraints, and (iv) the ability to maintain hedging services to customers due to the margining constraints and maximum trading limits implemented by clearing banks on supplier counterparties. As a result, UGI is considering all scenarios with respect to the future of its energy marketing business in Europe, including exit and wind down. On October 25, 2022, UGI announced the sale of its energy marketing business in the United Kingdom and in November 2022, UGI announced its intent to sell its energy marketing business located in France. The risks identified with respect to our energy marketing business in Europe have resulted in and may continue to have a material negative impact on our financial results.\nRisks Relating to Our Supply Chain and Our Ability to Obtain Adequate Quantities of LPG\nWe are dependent on our principal LPG suppliers, which increases the risks from an interruption in supply and transportation. During Fiscal 2022, AmeriGas Propane purchased approximately 85% of its propane needs from 20 suppliers. If supplies from these sources were interrupted, the cost of procuring replacement supplies and transporting those supplies from alternative locations might be materially higher and, at least on a short-term basis, our earnings could be affected. Additionally, in certain geographic areas, a single supplier provides more than 50% of AmeriGas Propanes propane requirements. Disruptions in supply in these geographic areas could also have an adverse impact on our earnings. Our international businesses are similarly dependent upon their LPG suppliers. For example, during Fiscal 2022, UGI Internationals business in the United Kingdom purchased approximately 90% of its LPG needs from two suppliers and, in Italy, approximately 74% of its supply was sourced from two suppliers. If supplies from UGI Internationals principal LPG sources are interrupted, the cost of procuring replacement supplies and transporting those supplies from alternative locations might be materially higher and our earnings could be adversely affected. There is no assurance that our international businesses will be able to continue to acquire sufficient supplies of LPG to meet demand at prices or within time periods that would allow them to remain competitive.\nOur ability to obtain sufficient quantities of LPG is dependent on transportation facilities and providers. Spikes in demand caused by weather or other factors can limit our access to port terminals and other transportation and storage facilities, disrupt transportation and limit our ability to obtain sufficient quantities of LPG. A significant increase in port and similar fees and fuel prices may also adversely affect our transportation costs and business. Transportation providers (rail and truck) in some circumstances have limited ability to provide additional resources in times of peak demand. Moreover, the ability of our transportation providers to maintain a staff of qualified truck drivers is critical to the success of our business. Regulatory requirements and an improvement in the economy could reduce the number of eligible drivers or require us to pay higher transportation fees as our transportation providers seek to pass on additional labor costs associated with attracting and retaining drivers.\nOur profitability is subject to LPG pricing and inventory risk. The retail LPG business is a margin-based business in which gross profits are dependent upon the excess of the sales price over LPG supply costs. LPG is a commodity, and, as such, its unit price is subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply or other market conditions. We have no control over supplies, commodity prices or market conditions. Consequently, the unit price of the LPG that our subsidiaries and other distributors and marketers purchase can change rapidly over a short period of time. Most of our domestic LPG product supply contracts permit suppliers to charge posted prices at the time of delivery or the current prices established at major U.S. storage points such as Mont Belvieu, Texas or Conway, Kansas. Most of our international LPG supply contracts are based on internationally quoted market prices. We also purchase a portion of our supplies in the spot market. Because our subsidiaries profitability is sensitive to changes in wholesale LPG supply costs, we will be adversely affected if we cannot pass on increases in the cost of LPG to our customers, or if there is a delay in passing on such cost increases. Due to competitive pricing in the industry, our subsidiaries may not fully be able to pass on product cost increases to our customers when product costs rise, or when our competitors do not raise their product prices in a timely manner. Finally, market volatility may cause our subsidiaries to sell LPG at less than the price at which they purchased it, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe offer our customers various fixed-price LPG programs, and a significant number of our customers utilize our fixed-price programs. In order to manage the price risk from offering these services, we utilize our physical inventory position, supplemented by forward commodity transactions with various third parties having terms and volumes substantially the same as our customers contracts, but there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective. In periods of high LPG price volatility, the fixed-price programs create exposure to over or under-supply positions as the demand from customers may significantly exceed or fall short of supply procured. In addition, if LPG prices decline significantly subsequent to customers signing up for a fixed-price program, there is a risk that customers will default on their commitments, adversely affecting our results of operations.\nChanges in commodity market prices may have a significant negative effect on our liquidity. Depending on the terms of our contracts with suppliers as well as our use of financial instruments to reduce volatility in the cost of LPG and natural gas, changes in the market price of LPG and natural gas can create margin payment obligations for us and expose us to increased liquidity risk. In addition, increased demand for domestically produced LPG and natural gas overseas may, depending on production volumes in the U.S., result in higher domestic prices and expose us to additional liquidity risks.\nSupplier and derivative counterparty defaults may have a negative effect on our operating results. When we enter into fixed-price sales contracts with customers, we typically enter into fixed-price purchase contracts with suppliers. Depending on changes in the market prices of products compared to the prices secured in our contracts with suppliers of LPG, natural gas and electricity, a default of or force majeure by one or more of our suppliers under such contracts could cause us to purchase those commodities at higher prices from alternate suppliers, which would have a negative impact on our operating results.\nAdditionally, we economically hedge the market risk associated with a substantial portion of our supply purchases using certain derivative instruments. Such changes in market prices of the aforementioned commodities could result in material exposures or significant concentrations of balances with derivative counterparties. If certain counterparties were unable to meet the obligations set forth in these derivative contracts and we were unable to fully mitigate this exposure via collateral deposit requirements and master netting arrangements, such outcomes could result in a negative effect on our operating results.\nOur business is dependent on the domestic and global supply chain to ensure that equipment, materials and other resources are available to both expand and maintain services in a safe and reliable manner. Moreover, prices of equipment, materials and other resources have increased recently and may continue to increase in the future. Failure to secure equipment, materials and other resources on economically acceptable terms may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Current domestic and global supply chain issues are delaying the delivery, and in some cases resulting in shortages of, materials, equipment and other resources that are critical to our business operations. Failure to eliminate or manage the\nconstraints in the supply chain may impact the availability of items that are necessary to support normal operations as well as materials that are required for continued infrastructure growth, including the replacement of end-of-life assets.\nMoreover, inflation is an area of increasing economic concern, both domestically and internationally. Changes in the costs of providing our energy products and services, including price increases in equipment and materials as well as increases in labor and distribution costs, may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations and/or result in corresponding price increases for the energy products and services we offer our customers.\nRisks Relating to Government Regulation and Oversight\nRegulators may not approve the rates we request and existing rates may be challenged, which may adversely affect our results of operations. In our Utilities segment, our distribution operations are subject to regulation by the PAPUC, WVPSC and MDPSC, depending on the state in which the operations are located. These regulatory bodies, among other things, approve the rates that Utilities may charge utility customers, thus impacting the returns that Utilities may earn on the assets that are dedicated to its operations. Utilities periodically files, and we expect to continue to periodically file, requests with these regulatory bodies to increase base rates charged to customers in the respective states in which Utilities operates. If Utilities is required in a rate proceeding to reduce the rates it charges its utility customers, or is unable to obtain approval for timely rate increases from the appropriate regulatory body, particularly when necessary to cover increased costs, Utilities revenue growth will be limited and earnings may decrease.\nThe enactment of proposed or future tax legislation may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. enacted the CARES Act. Our financial statements reflect the realized benefits of the CARES Act. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Application of the CARES Act requires significant judgments to be made in the interpretation of the law and significant estimates in the calculation of the provision for income taxes. If our interpretation of the CARES Act differs significantly from the interpretation of governing bodies, or if future administrations choose to repeal or replace the provisions of the CARES Act, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, the enactment of future tax legislation (such as the proposed OECD framework that aims to reform international taxation rules with the goal of ensuring that multinational corporations pay adequate taxes in the jurisdictions in which they operate and other similar proposals) could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, including our worldwide income tax provision and accruals reflected in our financial statements. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act was enacted on August 16, 2022. This law, among other provisions, imposes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income, which is effective for us beginning with Fiscal 2024, provides for an investment tax credit for qualified biomass property, and introduces a one percent excise tax on corporate stock repurchases after December 31, 2022. We are currently assessing the potential impact of these legislative changes and will continue to evaluate the overall impact of other current, future and proposed regulations and interpretive guidance from tax authorities on our effective tax rate and consolidated balance sheets. We are unable to predict whether any such changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted. Any future legislative changes could negatively impact our anticipated cash-flow and after-tax results of operations.\nOur need to comply with, and respond to, industry-wide changes resulting from, comprehensive, complex, and sometimes unpredictable governmental regulations, including regulatory initiatives aimed at increasing competition within our industry, may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth, which may adversely affect our operating results. While we generally refer to our Utilities segment as our regulated segment, there are many governmental regulations that have an impact on all of our businesses. Currently, we are subject to extensive and changing international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations including, but not limited to, safety, health, transportation, tax, and environmental laws and regulations that govern the marketing, storage, distribution, and transportation of our energy products. Moreover, existing statutes and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us that may affect our businesses in ways that we cannot predict.\nNew regulations, or a change in the interpretation of existing regulations, could result in increased expenditures. In addition, for many of our operations, we are required to obtain permits from regulatory authorities and, in some cases, such regulatory permits could subject our operations to additional regulations and standards of conduct. Failure to obtain or comply with these permits or applicable regulations and standards of conduct could result in civil and criminal fines or the cessation of the operations in violation. Governmental regulations and policies in the U.S. and Europe may provide for subsidies or incentives to customers who use alternative fuels instead of carbon fuels. The EU has committed to cut CO2 emissions and EU member states are proposing and implementing a range of subsidies and incentives to achieve the EUs climate change goals. These subsidies and incentives may result in reduced demand for our energy products and services.\nWe are investigating and remediating contamination at a number of present and former operating sites in the U.S., including former sites where we or our former subsidiaries operated MGPs. We have also received claims from third parties that allege that we are responsible for costs to clean up properties where we or our former subsidiaries operated a MGP or conducted other operations. Most of the costs we incur to remediate sites outside of Pennsylvania cannot currently be recovered in PAPUC rate proceedings, and insurance may not cover all or even part of these costs. Our actual costs to clean up these sites may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond our control, such as:\nthe discovery of presently unknown conditions;\nchanges in environmental laws and regulations;\njudicial rejection of our legal defenses to third-party claims; or\nthe insolvency of other responsible parties at the sites at which we are involved.\nMoreover, if we discover additional contaminated sites, we could be required to incur material costs, which would reduce our net income.\nWe also may be unable to timely respond to changes within the energy and utility sectors that may result from regulatory initiatives to further increase competition within our industry. Such regulatory initiatives may create opportunities for additional competitors to grow their business or enter our markets and, as a result, we may be unable to maintain our revenues or continue to pursue our current business strategy.\nOur operations, financial results and cash flows may be adversely affected by existing and future global climate change laws and regulations, including with respect to GHG emission restrictions, as well as market responses thereto. Climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention in the U.S. and in foreign countries. As a result, numerous proposals have been made, and could continue to be made, at the international, national, regional, state and local levels of government to monitor and limit GHG emissions and climate impact. These efforts have included consideration of, among other things, cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources.\nIncreased regulation of GHG emissions, or climate impact generally, could have significant additional adverse impacts on us as well as our suppliers, vendors, and customers. The adoption and implementation of any laws or regulations imposing obligations on, or limiting GHG emissions from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur significant costs to reduce GHG emissions associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for our energy products. The potential increase in our operating costs could include, but are not limited to, new costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on our facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our GHG emissions, pay taxes related to our GHG emissions, administer and manage a GHG emissions reduction program, and adversely impact the value of certain assets. We may not be able to pass on resulting increases in costs to customers. In addition, changes in regulatory policies that result in a reduction in the demand for hydrocarbon products and carbon-emitting fuel sources that are deemed to contribute to climate change, or restrict the use of such products or fuel sources, may reduce volumes available to us for processing, transportation, marketing and storage and could cause increases in costs or production disruptions. These developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial results, valuation and useful life of assets, and cash flows.\nChanges in data privacy and data protection laws and regulations or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business and financial results. As part of our operations, we collect, use, store and transfer the personal information and data of our employees as well as customer, vendor and supplier data in and across various jurisdictions. There has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information and data transfers, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer and personal privacy. The laws in these areas continue to develop and the changing nature of data protection, information security and privacy laws in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere could impact our processing of the personal information and data of our employees, vendors, suppliers and customers, which could lead to increased operating costs. Existing and emerging laws and regulations are inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving, differing, and sometimes conflicting interpretations. The EU adopted the GDPR, which expanded EU data protections, in certain circumstances, to companies outside of the EU processing data of EU residents, regardless of whether the processing occurs in the EU. Similarly, the State of California legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (the CPRA), which, among other things, grant a number of rights to California residents with respect to their personal information, and require companies to make extensive disclosures to consumers about such companies data collection, use, and sharing practices and inform consumers of their personal information rights. In addition, the CPRA created a new state privacy regulator, which will likely result in greater regulatory activity and enforcement in the privacy area. Comprehensive privacy laws with some similarities to the CCPA and CPRA have been proposed or passed at the U.S. federal and state levels, such as the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (the VCDPA) and the Colorado Privacy Act (the CPA). Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data as well as requiring disclosures about these practices. We expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations and industry standards concerning data privacy and data protection in the U.S., the EU and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such laws, regulations, interpretations and standards may have on our business.\nWhile we have invested significant time and resources in our GDPR compliance program, emerging and changing data privacy and data protection requirements, including CCPA, CPRA, VCDPA and CPA, as well as other new and upcoming federal and state privacy laws and industry standards may cause us to incur substantial fines, additional significant costs or require us to change our business practices. Any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or individuals. Moreover, any inquiries or investigations, any other government actions or any actions by individuals may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines, demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nThe provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), related regulations, and the rules adopted thereunder and other regulations, including the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (the EMIR), may have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to hedge risks associated with our business. Our derivative hedging activities are subject to Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, which regulates the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC and the federal banking regulators to implement the Dodd-Frank Acts provisions through rulemaking, including rules regarding mandatory clearing, trade execution and margin requirements. We have and expect to continue to qualify for and rely upon an exception from mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements for swaps entered into by commercial end-users to hedge commercial risks. In addition to relief from the clearing mandate, we also expect to continue to qualify for an exception for non-financial end-users from the margin requirements on uncleared swaps. If we are not able to do so and have to post margin as to our uncleared swaps in the future, our costs of entering into and maintaining swaps would be increased.\nBased on information available as of the date of this Report, the effect of such requirements will be likely to (directly or indirectly) increase our overall costs of entering into derivatives transactions. In particular, new margin requirements, position limits and significantly higher capital charges resulting from new global capital regulations, even if not directly applicable to us, may cause an increase in the pricing of derivatives transactions entered into by market participants to whom such requirements apply or affect our overall ability to enter into derivatives transactions with certain counterparties. While costs imposed directly on us due to regulatory requirements for derivatives under the Dodd-Frank Act, such as reporting, recordkeeping and electing the end-user exception from mandatory clearing, are relatively minor, costs imposed upon our counterparties may increase the cost of our doing business in the derivatives markets to the extent such costs are passed on to us.\nThe EMIR may result in increased costs for over-the-counter derivative counterparties trading in the EU and may also lead to an increase in the costs of, and demand for, the liquid collateral that the EMIR requires central counterparties to accept. Although we expect to continue to qualify as a non-financial counterparty under the EMIR, and thus not be required to post margin, we are currently subject to limited derivatives reporting requirements that could expand in the future, and may also be\nsubject to increased regulatory requirements, including recordkeeping, marking to market, timely confirmations, portfolio reconciliation and dispute resolution procedures. Provisions under the EMIR could significantly increase the cost of derivatives contracts, materially alter the terms of derivatives contracts and reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks that we encounter. The increased trading costs and collateral costs may have an adverse impact on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nGeneral Risks that May Impact Our Business and Our Shareholders\nThe inability to attract, develop, retain and engage key employees could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic, operational and financial plans. We are dependent upon the continued service and contributions of our management and key technical and professional employees, as well as our ability to transfer the knowledge and expertise of our workforce to new employees as our employees retire or we otherwise experience employee turnover. In addition, the success of our operations depends on our ability to identify, attract and develop skilled and experienced key employees. There is increased competition for experienced management and technical and professional employees, which could increase the costs associated with identifying, attracting and retaining such individuals. Additionally, we may not be able to attract, retain or engage key employees if our compensation and benefits program is not as robust as the compensation and benefits programs offered by other employers for similar roles. Further, a lack of employee engagement could lead to loss of productivity and increased employee burnout, turnover, absenteeism, safety incidents as well as decreased customer satisfaction. If we cannot identify, attract, develop, retain and engage management, technical and professional employees, along with other qualified employees, to support the various functions of our business, our operations and financial performance could be adversely impacted.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the spread of variant strains has adversely impacted our business, and could in the future materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic, including the spread of variant strains, has resulted in, and could continue to result in, widespread impacts on the global economy and on our employees, customers, third-party business partners and other stakeholders. While we have experienced improving activity in most markets and geographies, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 and variant strains will continue to spread and the extent and duration of domestic and global measures designed to contain the spread, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, vaccination mandates and business and government shutdowns. The continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic may, among other things:\nnegatively impact the financial condition of our customers and their ability to pay for our products and services;\ndecrease demand for our products and services, as was the case in Fiscal 2020 through part of Fiscal 2022 with respect to certain of our natural gas and propane products and services;\ndisrupt or delay progress in the development and completion of our energy infrastructure projects;\nprolong the time period necessary to perform maintenance of our infrastructure;\nresult in operational delays, including delay in the delivery of our products to customers;\nresult in temporary or permanent shortages in our workforce;\nresult in impairment relating to certain current and long-lived assets and goodwill;\ndelay the timeliness of our ability to source goods;\nresult in commodity price volatility and supply chain constraints, as was the case in in Fiscal 2020 through part of Fiscal 2022; and\nlimit or curtail significantly or entirely the ability of public utility commissions to approve or authorize applications and other requests we may make with respect to our regulated businesses.\nThroughout the pandemic, we have modified or restricted certain business and workforce practices (including employee travel, presence at employee work locations, and physical participation in meetings, events, and conferences) to protect the health and safety of our workforce, and to conform to government orders, as well as regulatory and public health authority guidance. While we have generally reopened our offices, our employees continue to be exposed to health and safety risks and we may reinstate modified or restricted business and workforce practices, including office closures, as the pandemic continues. We depend on our workforce to operate our facilities, deliver our products and provide services to customers. If a large portion of our operational workforce were to contract COVID-19 simultaneously, we would rely upon our business continuity plans in an effort to continue operations, but there is no certainty that such measures would be sufficient to mitigate the adverse impact to our operations.\nThe degree to which COVID-19 and variant strains may impact our business operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations is unknown at this time and will depend on future developments, including the continued spread of the virus and its variants, the efficacy of available vaccines, the severity of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, actions prescribed or ordered by governmental authorities, public health authority guidance, and when and to what extent economic and operating conditions can return to pre-pandemic levels.\nWe may not be able to collect on the accounts of our customers. We depend on the viability of our customers for collections of accounts receivable and notes receivable. Moreover, our businesses serve numerous retail customers, and as we grow our businesses organically and through acquisitions, our retail customer base is expected to expand. There can be no assurance that our customers will not experience financial difficulties in the future or that we will be able to collect all of our outstanding accounts receivable or notes receivable. Any such nonpayment by our customers could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to operating and litigation risks that may not be covered by insurance. Our business operations are subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incidental to the handling, storage and distribution of combustible products, such as LPG and natural gas, and the generation of electricity. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, and severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment arising from explosions and other catastrophic events, including acts of terrorism. As a result of these and other incidents, we are sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including regulatory investigations, claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. Additionally, environmental contamination or other incidents resulting in an environmental impact have resulted in, and could continue to result in, legal or regulatory proceedings (see Our need to comply with, and respond to, industry-wide changes resulting from, comprehensive, complex, and sometimes unpredictable governmental regulations, including regulatory initiatives aimed at increasing competition within our industry, may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth, which may adversely affect our operating results for more information on such proceedings). There can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to pending and future claims or that such levels of insurance would be available in the future at economical prices. Moreover, defense and settlement costs may be substantial, even with respect to claims and investigations that have no merit. If we cannot resolve these matters favorably, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects may be materially adversely affected.\nThe risk of natural disasters, pandemics and catastrophic events, including acts of war and terrorism, may adversely affect the economy and the price and availability of LPG, other refined fuels and natural gas. Natural disasters, pandemics and catastrophic events, such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, terrorist attacks, war, political unrest and other similar occurrences, may adversely impact the demand for, price and availability of LPG (including propane), other refined fuels and natural gas, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations, our ability to raise capital and our future growth. The impact that the foregoing may have on our industries in general, and on us in particular, is not known at this time. A natural disaster, pandemic or an act of war or terrorism could result in disruptions of crude oil or natural gas supplies and markets (the sources of LPG), cause price volatility in the cost of LPG, fuel oil and natural gas, and our infrastructure facilities could be directly or indirectly impacted. Additionally, if our means of supply transportation, such as rail, truck or pipeline, are delayed or temporarily unavailable due to a natural disaster, pandemic, war or terrorist activity, we may be unable to transport LPG and other refined fuels in a timely manner or at all. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could adversely affect our revenues or restrict our future growth. Instability in the financial markets as a result of a natural disaster, pandemic, war or terrorism could also affect our ability to raise capital. We have opted to purchase insurance coverage for natural disasters and terrorist acts within our property and casualty insurance programs, but we can give no assurance that our insurance coverage would be adequate to fully compensate us for any losses to our business or property resulting from natural disasters or terrorist acts.\nOur indebtedness may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our debt agreements also contain covenants that restrict our operational flexibility. As of September 30, 2022, we had total indebtedness of $7 billion. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and operational flexibility by, among other things:\nimpairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes\u037e\nlimiting operational flexibility and our ability to pursue business opportunities and implement certain business strategies;\nimpairing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions;\nimpairing our ability to repay our indebtedness at maturity, especially where our debt agreements contain significant maturities;\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates where our debt agreements have variable interest rates; and\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt and fewer guarantee obligations.\nThe occurrence of any of such events could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, if our credit ratings were to be downgraded, or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels, our industry, or us, our access to capital and the cost of any future debt financing could be negatively impacted. Additionally, our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance,\nwhich is subject to economic and political conditions, seasonal cycles and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, we may be required to, among other things, refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness, and any such refinancing, restructuring or sale of assets might not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nIn addition, our debt agreements generally contain customary affirmative covenants, including, among others, covenants pertaining to the delivery of financial statements; certain financial covenants; notices of default and certain other material events; payment of obligations; preservation of corporate existence, rights, privileges, permits, licenses, franchises and intellectual property; maintenance of property and insurance and compliance with laws, as well as customary negative covenants, including, among others, limitations on the incurrence of liens, investments and indebtedness; mergers, acquisitions and certain other fundamental changes; transfers, leases or dispositions of assets outside the ordinary course of business\u037e restricted payments; changes in our line of business\u037e transactions with affiliates and burdensome agreements. These covenants could affect our ability to operate our business, respond to changes in business and economic conditions, obtain additional financing (if needed), and may increase the amount of interest expense we ultimately pay pursuant to the debt agreements. Further, our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our debt agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions or regulatory changes. A failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements could result in a default or an event of default. Upon an event of default, unless waived, the lenders could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans, require cash collateralization of letters of credit, cause their loans to become due and payable in full, foreclose against any assets securing the debt under our debt agreements and force us and our subsidiaries into bankruptcy or liquidation. If the payment of our debt is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay down the indebtedness (together with accrued interest and fees), or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. This could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants, or require incremental collateral, which may further restrict our business operations or conflict with covenant restrictions then in effect. As a result, there is no guarantee that financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations. See the liquidity section in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information on our current debt agreements.\nOur holding company structure could limit our ability to pay dividends or service debt. We are a holding company whose material assets are the stock of our subsidiaries. Our ability to pay dividends on our Common Stock and to pay principal and accrued interest on our debt, if any, depends on the payment of dividends to us by our principal subsidiaries. Payments to us by our subsidiaries, in turn, depend upon their consolidated results of operations and cash flows. The operations of our subsidiaries are affected by conditions beyond our control, including weather, regulations, competition in national and international markets we serve, the costs and availability of propane, butane, natural gas, electricity, and other energy sources and capital market conditions. The ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us is also affected by the level of indebtedness of our subsidiaries, which is substantial, and the restrictions on payments to us imposed under the terms of such indebtedness.\nVolatility in credit and capital markets may restrict our ability to grow, increase the likelihood of defaults by our suppliers and vendors, customers and counterparties and adversely affect our operating results. Volatility in credit and capital markets may create additional risks to our businesses in the future. We are exposed to financial market risk (including refinancing risk) resulting from, among other things, changes in interest rates and conditions in the credit and capital markets. Adverse developments in the credit markets may increase our possible exposure to the liquidity, default and credit risks of our suppliers and vendors, counterparties associated with derivative financial instruments and our customers. Although we believe that current financial market conditions, if they were to continue for the foreseeable future, will not have a significant impact on our ability to fund our existing operations, less favorable market conditions could restrict our ability to grow through acquisitions, limit the scope of major capital projects if access to credit and capital markets is limited, or adversely affect our operating results.\nWe depend on our intellectual property and failure to protect that intellectual property could adversely affect us. We seek trademark protection for our brands in each of our businesses, and we invest significant resources in developing our business brands. Failure to maintain our trademarks and brands could adversely affect our customer-facing businesses and our operational results.\nDeclines in the stock market or bond market, and a low interest rate environment, may negatively impact our pension liability. Declines in the stock market and a low interest rate environment historically have resulted in a significant impact on our pension liability and funded status. Declines in the stock or bond market and valuation of stocks or bonds, combined with low interest rates, could further impact our pension liability and funded status and increase the amount of required contributions to our pension plans.\nUnless we otherwise consent in writing, our Amended and Restated Bylaws designate a state court located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania or, if no state court located within such county has jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, the federal United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that, unless we otherwise consent in writing, a state court located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania or, if no state court located within such county has jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, the federal United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, as the sole and exclusive forum for: (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us; (b) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of duty owed to us or our shareholders by any director, officer, or other employee of ours; (c) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against us or against any of our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to, or involving any interpretation or enforcement of, any provision of the Pennsylvania Associations Code, Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, or our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws; and (d) any action or proceeding asserting a claim peculiar to the relationship between or among us and our officers, directors, and shareholders, or otherwise governed by or involving the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the Securities Act.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Pennsylvania were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nMD&A discusses our results of operations for Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, and our financial condition. For discussion of our results of operations and cash flows for Fiscal 2021 compared with Fiscal 2020, refer to Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Fiscal 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on November 19, 2021. MD&A should be read in conjunction with Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below including Segment Information included in Note 23 to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBecause most of our businesses sell or distribute energy products used in large part for heating purposes, our results are significantly influenced by temperatures in our service territories, particularly during the heating-season months of October through March. Accordingly, our results of operations, after adjusting for the effects of gains and losses on derivative instruments not associated with current-period transactions as further discussed below, are significantly higher in our first and second fiscal quarters.\nExecutive Overview\nRecent Developments\nUGI International Energy Marketing Business\nIn October 2022, UGI International, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, sold its natural gas marketing business located in the United Kingdom resulting in a net cash payment to the buyer of $19 million which includes working capital adjustments. The assets and liabilities associated with this business, primarily attributable to the value of unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts, are classified as held-for-sale on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2022. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022, the Company recognized an impairment charge, which was limited to the disposal groups long-lived assets in accordance with its policy related to assets held for sale. Such impairment in Fiscal 2022 was not material. An incremental pretax loss of approximately $220 million was recognized in the first quarter of Fiscal 2023 in connection with the completed sale, largely attributable to the difference between the net cash payment to the buyer and the fair value of net derivative assets sold along with customer contracts as of the transaction date. The change in the net assets held for sale as of September 30, 2022, and the loss recognized upon disposal in October 2022, was due to the change in the fair value of the net derivative assets subsequent to September 30, 2022.\nIn November 2022, the Company announced its intent to sell its energy marketing business located in France, with a definitive agreement expected to be signed in the first quarter of Fiscal 2023. The Company expects to recognize a significant loss on the sale largely attributable to the value of net derivative assets sold along with the related customer contracts. At September 30, 2022, the carrying value of the net assets of the Companys energy marketing business in France amounted to approximately $470 million with primarily all of that value related to the fair value of the applicable derivative contracts.\nGlobal Macroeconomic Conditions\nDuring Fiscal 2021 and continuing into the current fiscal year, global commodity and labor markets have experienced significant inflationary pressures attributable to various economic and political factors, including: the economic recovery and evolving consumer patterns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; supply chain issues associated with labor shortages; significant inflationary pressures on commodity prices; and political and regulatory conditions resulting from the war between Russia and Ukraine, among others. These factors have led to significant volatility across various consumer price indices during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2022. We have experienced substantial shifts in commodity prices, particularly in LPG, natural gas and electricity prices, which, in turn, have led to extensive mark-to-market impacts on commodity derivative instruments not associated with current-period activity. The ongoing strain on supply costs has resulted in increased inventory costs and certain distribution expenses across all of our businesses. It has also affected requirements around cash collateral and restricted cash associated with our outstanding derivatives. We cannot predict the duration or total magnitude of these factors and the total effects on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows at this time. However, we continue to evaluate and react to these global economic and political conditions and remain focused on managing our financial condition and liquidity as these conditions continue to evolve.\nAcquisition of Mountaineer Gas Company\nOn September 1, 2021, UGI acquired Mountaineer, the largest natural gas distribution company in West Virginia for a purchase price of $540 million, which included the assumption of approximately $140 million principal amounts of long-term debt. Mountaineer serves nearly 214,000 customers across 50 of the states 55 counties, and is subject to regulation by the WVPSC. The Mountaineer Acquisition was funded with cash proceeds from the 2021 UGI Corporation Senior Credit Facility and the issuance of Equity Units and cash on hand. Mountaineer is included in the Utilities segment as of and in all periods subsequent to the acquisition date. For additional information on the Mountaineer Acquisition and the associated financing activities, see Notes 5, 6 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContinuing Business Transformation Initiatives\nBy the end of Fiscal 2021, AmeriGas Propane and UGI International substantially completed their previously announced business transformation initiatives. Benefits provided under each initiative were consistent with expectations during Fiscal 2022, and are expected to provide ongoing annual benefits of more than $150 million and \u20ac30 million, respectively.\nBeginning in Fiscal 2020, we initiated a transformation project focused on our corporate support functions including: finance, procurement, human resources and information technology. This initiative will standardize processes and activities across our global platform, while leveraging the use of best practices and efficiencies between our businesses. While this initiative is being coordinated across multiple support functions, each function is at a different stage of transformation and will undergo the required changes by the end of Fiscal 2023. In connection with these activities, we expect to incur approximately $40 million of non-recurring costs during that time resulting in more than $15 million of ongoing annualized savings by the end of Fiscal 2023.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nUGI management uses adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation and adjusted diluted earnings per share, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures, when evaluating UGIs overall performance. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to investors about UGIs performance because they eliminate gains and losses on commodity and certain foreign currency derivative instruments not associated with current-period transactions and other significant discrete items that can affect the comparison of period-over-period results.\nUGI does not designate its commodity and certain foreign currency derivative instruments as hedges under GAAP. Volatility in net income attributable to UGI Corporation can occur as a result of gains and losses on such derivative instruments not associated with current-period transactions. These gains and losses result principally from recording changes in unrealized gains and losses on unsettled commodity and certain foreign currency derivative instruments and, to a much lesser extent, certain realized gains and losses on settled commodity derivative instruments that are not associated with current-period transactions. However, because these derivative instruments economically hedge anticipated future purchases or sales of energy commodities, or in the case of certain foreign currency derivatives, reduce volatility in anticipated future earnings associated with our foreign operations, we expect that such gains or losses will be largely offset by gains or losses on anticipated future energy commodity transactions or mitigate volatility in anticipated future earnings. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP measures.\nThe following tables reflect the adjustments referred to above and reconcile net income attributable to UGI Corporation, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation, and reconcile diluted earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted diluted earnings per share:\nYear Ended September 30,\n(Millions of dollars, except per share amounts) 2022 2021\nAdjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation:\nAmeriGas Propane $ 112 $ 168\nUGI International 175 221\nMidstream & Marketing 163 107\nUtilities 206 144\nCorporate & Other (a) 417 827\nNet income attributable to UGI Corporation 1,073 1,467\nNet gains on commodity derivative instruments not associated with current-period transactions (net of tax of $140 and $389, respectively)\n(458) (1,001)\nUnrealized gains on foreign currency derivative instruments (net of tax of $14 and $2, respectively)\n(36) (6)\nBusiness transformation expenses (net of tax of $(2) and $(27), respectively)\n7 74\nAcquisition and integration expenses associated with the Mountaineer Acquisition (net of tax of $(1) and $(4), respectively)\n1 10\nImpairment of customer relationship intangible (net of tax of $0 and $(5), respectively)\n- 15\nImpairments of certain equity method investments and assets (net of tax of $(14) and $0, respectively)\n26 93\nImpact of change in tax law (19) (23)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt (net of tax of $(3) and $0, respectively)\n8 -\nRestructuring costs (net of tax of $(10) and $0, respectively)\n24 -\nTotal adjustments (a) (b) (447) (838)\nAdjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation $ 626 $ 629\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share:\nAmeriGas Propane $ 0.52 $ 0.79\nUGI International 0.81 1.04\nMidstream & Marketing 0.76 0.51\nUtilities 0.95 0.68\nCorporate & Other (a) 1.93 3.90\nEarnings per share - diluted 4.97 6.92\nNet gains on commodity derivative instruments not associated with current-period transactions (2.11) (4.72)\nUnrealized gains on foreign currency derivative instruments (0.17) (0.03)\nBusiness transformation expenses 0.03 0.35\nAcquisition and integration expenses associated with the Mountaineer Acquisition - 0.04\nImpairment of customer relationship intangible - 0.07\nImpairments of certain equity method investments and assets 0.12 0.44\nImpact of change in tax law (0.09) (0.11)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt 0.03 -\nRestructuring costs 0.12 -\nTotal adjustments (a) (2.07) (3.96)\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share $ 2.90 $ 2.96\n(a)Corporate & Other includes certain adjustments made to our reporting segments in arriving at net income attributable to UGI Corporation.

See Note 23 to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these adjustments, as well as other items included within Corporate & Other.\n(b)Income taxes associated with pre-tax adjustments determined using statutory business unit tax rates.\nFiscal 2022 Compared with Fiscal 2021\nDiscussion. Net income attributable to UGI Corporation was $1,073 million for Fiscal 2022 (equal to $4.97 per diluted share) compared to $1,467 million for Fiscal 2021 (equal to $6.92 per diluted share). Net income attributable to UGI Corporation in Fiscal 2022 reflects a $513 million year-over-year decrease in net unrealized gains on commodity derivative instruments and certain foreign currency derivative instruments. This decrease reflects the significant volatility related to commodity prices during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, as well as the stronger U.S dollar versus the euro, and has contributed to the accumulation of substantial derivative assets related to the Companys commodity derivative instruments at both September 30, 2022 and 2021. Net income attributable to UGI Corporation for Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021 also includes (1) impairments of certain equity method investments and other assets of $26 million and $108 million, respectively; (2) benefits related to tax law changes of $19 million and $23 million, respectively; (3) business transformation expenses of $7 million and $74 million, respectively; and (4) acquisition and integration expenses of $1 million and $10 million, respectively. Net income attributable to UGI Corporation for Fiscal 2022 also includes restructuring costs of $21 million largely attributable to a reduction in workforce and related costs, and a loss on extinguishment of debt of $8 million associated with financing activities at UGI International.\nAdjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation for Fiscal 2022 was $626 million (equal to $2.90 per diluted share) compared to adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation for Fiscal 2021 of $629 million (equal to $2.96 per diluted share). The slight decrease in adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation during Fiscal 2022 reflects lower earnings contributions from our LPG businesses which were significantly impacted by the effects of commodity price volatility on current-period margins and related volumes and the absence of a Fiscal 2021 tax benefit under the CARES Act. These factors were largely offset by higher earnings from our Utilities and Midstream & Marketing segments, which include contributions attributable to recent acquisitions.\nAmeriGas Propanes adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation decreased $56 million during Fiscal 2022. This decrease largely reflects lower retail propane margin primarily attributable to lower retail volumes sold and higher operating and administrative expenses largely attributable to inflationary pressures. These factors were partially offset by higher non-propane margin and gains on asset sales.\nUGI Internationals adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation decreased $46 million during Fiscal 2022 principally reflecting lower total margin largely attributable to the effects of commodity price volatility on our energy marketing business and the net effect of weaker foreign currencies compared to the prior year. These factors were partially offset by higher gains on asset sales.\nMidstream & Marketing adjusted net income in Fiscal 2022 was $56 million higher than the prior year. This increase principally reflects higher margins related to natural gas marketing activities, higher total earnings from renewable energy marketing activities, and incremental contributions from UGI Moraine East.\nUtilities Fiscal 2022 adjusted net income increased $62 million compared to the prior year. The increase was largely related to the full-year impact of earnings attributable to the Mountaineer Acquisition, an increase in DSIC rates and higher margin from large delivery including the effects of customer growth at UGI Utilities also contributed to the earnings improvement during the current year.\nAmeriGas Propane 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease)\n(Dollars in millions)\nRevenues $ 2,943 $ 2,614 $ 329 13 %\nTotal margin (a) $ 1,330 $ 1,397 $ (67) (5) %\nOperating and administrative expenses $ 889 $ 869 $ 20 2 %\nOperating income / earnings before interest expense and income taxes $ 307 $ 385 $ (78) (20) %\nRetail gallons sold (millions) 888 968 (80) (8) %\nDegree days - % warmer than normal (b) (0.8) % (2.8) % - -\n(a)Total margin represents revenues less cost of sales.\n(b)Deviation from average heating degree days is determined on a rolling 10-year period utilizing volume-weighted weather data based on weather statistics provided by NOAA for 344 regions in the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.\nAverage temperatures during Fiscal 2022 were 0.8% warmer than normal and 1.8% colder than the prior year. Total retail gallons sold decreased 8% during Fiscal 2022 principally reflecting the continuing impact of customer service challenges that occurred in Fiscal 2021, staffing shortages in key delivery related positions, increased price sensitivity in the higher commodity cost environment and the absence of the beneficial prior-year impact of COVID-19 on cylinder exchange and resale volumes.\nTotal revenues increased $329 million during Fiscal 2022 largely reflecting higher average propane selling prices ($468 million) and, to much lesser extent, higher wholesale volumes ($29 million). These increases were partially offset by the effects of the lower retail propane volumes sold ($182 million). Average daily wholesale propane commodity prices during Fiscal 2022 at Mont Belvieu, Texas, one of the major supply points in the U.S., were approximately 39% higher than such prices during Fiscal 2021. Total cost of sales increased $396 million during Fiscal 2022 largely attributable to the higher average propane product costs ($448 million) and, to a much lesser extent, the higher wholesale propane volumes ($27 million). These increases were partially offset by the effects of the lower retail propane volumes sold ($82 million).\nAmeriGas Propane total margin decreased $67 million in Fiscal 2022 largely attributable to the lower retail propane volumes sold ($100 million) compared to the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by higher average retail propane margin ($28 million) and increased non-propane margin ($11 million) largely attributable to higher fuel recovery and tank rental fees.\nOperating income and earnings before interest expense and income taxes decreased $78 million during Fiscal 2022 primarily attributable to the previously mentioned decrease in total margin and higher operating and administrative expenses ($20 million). Operating income and earnings before interest expense and income taxes in Fiscal 2022 also includes an increase in other income largely related to gains on asset sales. The increase in operating and administrative expenses in Fiscal 2022 was impacted by the inflationary cost environment and includes, among other things, higher bad debt expense ($13 million), vehicle fuel ($13 million), general insurance and claims expense ($11 million), and telecommunications expenses ($10 million). These increases were partially offset by lower expenses associated with employee compensation and benefits ($22 million), advertising ($8 million) and vehicle leases ($5 million).\nUGI International 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease)\n(Dollars in millions)\nRevenues $ 3,686 $ 2,651 $ 1,035 39 %\nTotal margin (a) $ 935 $ 1,053 $ (118) (11) %\nOperating and administrative expenses $ 611 $ 622 $ (11) (2) %\nOperating income $ 237 $ 314 $ (77) (25) %\nEarnings before interest expense and income taxes $ 254 $ 317 $ (63) (20) %\nLPG retail gallons sold (millions) 799 792 7 1 %\nDegree days - % (warmer) colder than normal (b) (2.6) % 0.4 % - -\n(a)Total margin represents total revenues less total cost of sales.\n(b)Deviation from average heating degree days is determined on a rolling 10-year period utilizing volume-weighted weather data at locations in our UGI International service territories.\nAverage temperatures during Fiscal 2022 were 2.6% warmer than normal and 5.0% warmer than Fiscal 2021. Total LPG retail gallons sold during Fiscal 2022 increased slightly compared to Fiscal 2021 largely attributable to the recovery of certain bulk volumes that were negatively impacted by COVID-19 in Fiscal 2021 and favorable crop drying campaigns, partially offset by warmer weather.\nUGI International base-currency results are translated into U.S. dollars based upon exchange rates experienced during the reporting periods. The functional currency of a significant portion of our UGI International results is the euro and, to a much lesser extent, the British pound sterling. During Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, the average unweighted euro-to-dollar translation rates were approximately $1.08 and $1.20, respectively, and the average unweighted British pound sterling-to-dollar translation rates were approximately $1.28 and $1.37, respectively. Fluctuations in these foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant impact on the individual financial statement components discussed below. The impact of such changes on earnings, however, is mitigated by the effects of forward foreign currency exchange contracts entered into over a multi-year period intended to reduce volatility in U.S. dollar amounts resulting from changes in exchange rates. These forward foreign currency exchange contracts resulted in realized net gains of $13 million and $1 million, respectively, in Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021.\nUGI International revenues and cost of sales increased $1,035 million and $1,153 million, respectively, during Fiscal 2022. Average wholesale prices for propane and butane during Fiscal 2022 in northwest Europe were approximately 53% and 70%\nhigher, respectively, compared to Fiscal 2021. The increase in revenues and cost of sales principally reflects the impact on our energy marketing business from significant increases and volatility in natural gas and electricity prices and the effects of the previously mentioned higher average propane and butane selling prices and product costs on our LPG business compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by the translation effects of weaker foreign currencies as reflected in the previously mentioned average exchange rates.\nUGI International total margin decreased $118 million during Fiscal 2022 primarily reflecting lower total margin from our energy marketing business (approximately $53 million) and the translation effects of the weaker foreign currencies. These factors were partially offset by higher total margin from our LPG business attributable to strong margin management efforts despite the effects of the previously mentioned higher product costs. The lower total margin from our energy marketing business is largely due to the impact of significant volatility in commodity costs and its effects on unit margins of certain customer contracts which were largely confined to the heating-season months of October through March during Fiscal 2022.\nUGI International operating income and earnings before interest expense and income taxes decreased $77 million and $63 million, respectively, during Fiscal 2022. The decrease in operating income principally reflects the decrease in total margin partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization ($18 million), lower operating and administrative expenses ($11 million) and higher gains associated with the sale of assets compared to Fiscal 2021. The decrease in depreciation and amortization principally reflects the effects of currency translation. The net decrease in operating and administrative expenses compared to the prior year was driven by the translation effects of the weaker foreign currencies largely offset by the effects of inflation on the underlying distribution, personnel and maintenance costs. The decrease in earnings before interest expense and income taxes in Fiscal 2022 largely reflects the decrease in operating income partially offset by higher realized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts ($12 million) entered into in order to reduce volatility in UGI International earnings resulting from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nMidstream & Marketing 2022 2021 Increase\n(Dollars in millions)\nRevenues $ 2,326 $ 1,406 $ 920 65 %\nTotal margin (a) $ 450 $ 373 $ 77 21 %\nOperating and administrative expenses $ 129 $ 129 $ - - %\nOperating income $ 246 $ 160 $ 86 54 %\nEarnings before interest expense and income taxes $ 269 $ 190 $ 79 42 %\n(a)Total margin represents total revenues less total cost of sales.\nAverage temperatures across Midstream & Marketings energy marketing territory during Fiscal 2022 were 8.1% warmer than normal and 4.3% warmer than the prior year.\nMidstream & Marketings revenues increased $920 million compared to the prior year principally reflecting increased revenues from natural gas marketing activities ($845 million), including the effects of peaking and capacity management activities, which were impacted by significantly higher average natural gas prices compared to the prior year. This increase in revenues was partially offset by lower volumes attributable to the warmer weather. Higher revenues associated with retail power and generation ($45 million) and natural gas gathering activities ($27 million) also contributed to the increase.\nMidstream & Marketing cost of sales was $1,876 million in Fiscal 2022 compared to $1,033 million in Fiscal 2021. The $843 million increase principally reflects higher cost of sales related to the previously mentioned natural gas marketing activities ($807 million) which include the effects of significantly higher product costs in Fiscal 2022 partially offset by the lower volumes sold. Higher cost of sales associated with retail power and generation ($40 million) also contributed to the increase.\nMidstream & Marketing total margin increased $77 million in Fiscal 2022 largely reflecting improved margin from natural gas marketing activities ($38 million), including the effects of peaking and capacity management activities, and reflects the positive impact of settlement timing of certain multi-year commodity storage hedge contracts during Fiscal 2022. The increase in total margin also includes incremental margin attributable to UGI Moraine East ($15 million), higher total margin from renewable energy marketing activities ($9 million) including the impact of increased average pricing related to environmental credits compared to Fiscal 2021, and higher retail power and generation margin ($5 million).\nMidstream & Marketing operating income and earnings before interest expense and income taxes during Fiscal 2022 increased $86 million and $79 million, respectively, compared to the prior year. The increase in operating income principally reflects the\nincrease in total margin and the absence of a contingent consideration adjustment related to the GHI acquisition in the prior year partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense largely attributable to UGI Moraine East. The increase in earnings before interest expense and income taxes reflects the improvement in operating income partially offset by lower income from equity-method investments.\nUtilities 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease)\n(Dollars in millions)\nRevenues $ 1,620 $ 1,079 $ 541 50 %\nTotal margin (a) $ 801 $ 616 $ 185 30 %\nOperating and administrative expenses (a) $ 332 $ 254 $ 78 31 %\nOperating income $ 327 $ 241 $ 86 36 %\nEarnings before interest expense and income taxes $ 336 $ 242 $ 94 39 %\nGas Utility system throughput - bcf\nCore market 100 77 23 30 %\nTotal 363 311 52 17 %\nElectric Utility distribution sales - gwh 997 998 (1) - %\nNatural gas degree days - % warmer than normal (b) (7.5) % (6.5) % - -\n(a)Total margin represents total revenues less total cost of sales and revenue-related taxes (i.e. Electric Utility gross receipts and business and occupation taxes) of $21 million and $5 million, respectively, during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021. For financial statement purposes, revenue-related taxes are included in Operating and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income (but are excluded from operating expenses presented above).\n(b)Deviation from average heating degree days is determined on a 10-year period utilizing volume-weighted weather data based on weather statistics provided by NOAA for airports located within Utilities natural gas service territory.\nTemperatures in Utilities natural gas service territory during Fiscal 2022 were 7.5% warmer than normal and slightly warmer than the prior year. Utilities core market and total natural gas system volumes increased (23 bcf and 52 bcf, respectively) during Fiscal 2022 largely related to incremental volumes attributable to Mountaineer.\nUtilities revenues increased $541 million in Fiscal 2022 reflecting a $505 million increase in natural gas revenues and a $36 million increase in Electric Utility revenues. The increase in natural gas revenues principally reflects incremental revenues attributable to Mountaineer ($249 million), higher PGC rates reflecting higher natural gas costs, higher pricing on off-system sales, increased DSIC rates, and the full-year impact of the increase in base rates that went into effect during Fiscal 2021. The increase in Electric Utility revenues during Fiscal 2022 reflects higher DS rates compared to the prior year and the increase in base rates that went into effect in November 2021.\nUtilities cost of sales (including revenue-related taxes) was $819 million in Fiscal 2022 compared with $463 million in Fiscal 2021. Natural gas cost of sales increased during Fiscal 2022 ($326 million) largely attributable to incremental cost of sales attributable to Mountaineer ($126 million), higher PGC rates compared to the prior year, and increased cost of sales associated with off-system sales. Electric Utility cost of sales increased during Fiscal 2022 ($30 million) primarily related to the higher DS rates compared to the prior year.\nUtilities total margin increased $185 million during Fiscal 2022 primarily related to higher natural gas margin ($179 million) compared to Fiscal 2021 largely reflecting incremental margin attributable to Mountaineer ($123 million). The increase in total natural gas margin also includes higher margin attributable to the increased DSIC rates, higher margin from large delivery service customers including the effects of customer growth compared to the prior year, and the previously mentioned full-year impact of the increase in base rates. Electric Utility margin increased $6 million largely attributable to the increase in base rates compared to the prior year.\nUtilities operating income and earnings before interest expense and income taxes during Fiscal 2022 increased $86 million and $94 million, respectively, compared to the prior year. The increase in operating income largely reflects the previously mentioned increase in total margin, partially offset by higher operating and administrative expenses ($78 million) and depreciation expense ($25 million) compared to the prior year, both principally related to incremental expenses attributable to Mountaineer. The higher depreciation expense compared to the prior year also includes the effects of continued distribution system capital expenditure activity. The increase in earnings before interest expense and income taxes principally reflects the increase in operating income and higher pension non-service income compared to the prior year.\nInterest Expense and Income Taxes\nOur consolidated interest expense during Fiscal 2022 was $329 million compared to $310 million during the prior year. The increase in interest expense principally reflects the effects of incremental long-term debt outstanding during the current period, net of repayments, primarily related to the Mountaineer Acquisition and UGI Utilities issuance of senior notes during Fiscal 2022 and the second half of Fiscal 2021. Higher average short-term borrowings outstanding compared to the prior year also contributed to the increase in interest expense.\nOur effective income tax rate decreased between Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2022 due primarily to the benefit of the impact on net deferred tax liabilities of the reduction in the Pennsylvania statutory income tax rate. This benefit exceeded the prior year net benefits attributable to the CARES Act and the election made under a tax law change in Italy which allowed us to step up its tax basis on certain assets in exchange for paying a three percent substitute tax, partially offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance on the PennEast impairment. For additional information on our income taxes, including tax law changes, see Note 7 to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nThe Company expects to have sufficient liquidity including cash on hand and available borrowing capacity, to continue to support long-term commitments and ongoing operations despite uncertainties associated with ongoing global macroeconomic conditions including, among others, changes in consumer behavior resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the inflationary cost environment and ongoing energy commodity price volatility. Our total available liquidity balance, comprising cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facilities, totaled approximately $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our total available liquidity at September 30, 2022 was affected, in part, by $398 million of cash collateral received from derivative counterparties resulting from the impact of rising commodity prices and an accumulation of derivative assets associated with our commodity derivative instruments. The Company does not have any near-term senior note or term loan maturities. The Company cannot predict the duration or total magnitude of the uncertain economic factors mentioned above and the total effects they will have on its liquidity, debt covenants, financial condition or the timing of capital expenditures. UGI and its subsidiaries were in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2022.\nWe depend on both internal and external sources of liquidity to provide funds for working capital and to fund capital requirements. Our short-term cash requirements not met by cash from operations are generally satisfied with borrowings under credit facilities and, in the case of Midstream & Marketing, also from a Receivables Facility. Long-term cash requirements are generally met through the issuance of long-term debt or equity securities. We believe that each of our business units has sufficient liquidity in the forms of cash and cash equivalents on hand; cash expected to be generated from operations; credit facility and Receivables Facility borrowing capacity; and the ability to obtain long-term financing to meet anticipated contractual and projected cash commitments. Issuances of debt and equity securities in the capital markets and additional credit facilities may not, however, be available to us on acceptable terms.\nThe primary sources of UGIs cash and cash equivalents are the dividends and other cash payments made to UGI or its corporate subsidiaries by its principal business units. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $405 million at September 30, 2022, compared with $855 million at September 30, 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2022 reflects the previously mentioned cash collateral deposits received from our derivative instrument counterparties. This is attributable to significant mark-to-market gains on our commodity derivative instruments resulting from the steep rise and volatility in commodity prices during Fiscal 2022 and 2021. This cash could be returned to such counterparties as commodity prices and their impact on our commodity derivative instruments stabilizes or reverses. Excluding these collateral deposits received and cash and cash equivalents that reside at UGIs operating subsidiaries, at September 30, 2022 and 2021, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $140 million and $172 million, respectively. Such cash is available to pay dividends on UGI Common Stock and for investment purposes.\nDuring Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, our principal business units paid cash dividends and made other cash payments to UGI and its subsidiaries as follows:\n(Millions of dollars) 2022 2021\nAmeriGas Propane $ 227 $ 135\nUGI International 116 212\nMidstream & Marketing - 25\nUtilities - 35\nTotal $ 343 $ 407\nCommon and Preferred Stock\nIssuance of Equity Units\nOn May 25, 2021, the Company issued 2.2 million Equity Units with a total notional value of $220 million. Each Equity Unit has a stated amount of $100 and consists of (1) a 10% undivided beneficial ownership interest in one share of Convertible Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share and (2) a 2024 Purchase Contract. The Company received approximately $213 million in proceeds from the issuance of the Equity Units, net of offering expenses and underwriting costs and commissions, and issued 220,000 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, recording $213 million in Preferred stock on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The proceeds were used to pay a portion of the purchase price for the Mountaineer Acquisition and related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes. For additional information on the Mountaineer Acquisition and the issuance of Equity Units, see Notes 5 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDividends\nQuarterly dividends per share of UGI Common Stock paid during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021 were as follows:\n2022 2021\n1st Quarter\n$ 0.345 $ 0.330\n2nd Quarter\n0.345 0.330\n3rd Quarter\n0.360 0.345\n4th Quarter\n0.360 0.345\nTotal $ 1.410 $ 1.350\nOn November 17, 2022, UGIs Board of Directors declared a cash dividend equal to $0.360 per common share. The dividend will be payable on January 1, 2023, to shareholders of record on December 15, 2022.\nRepurchases of Common Stock\nDuring Fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased 900,000 shares at a total purchase price of $38 million. There were no such repurchases during Fiscal 2021. For additional information on the authorization of these repurchases, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLong-term Debt and Credit Facilities\nThe Companys debt outstanding at September 30, 2022 and 2021, comprised the following:\n2022 2021\n(Millions of dollars) AmeriGas Propane UGI International Midstream & Marketing Utilities Corp. & Other Total Total\nShort-term borrowings $ 131 $ 1 $ - $ 236 $ - $ 368 $ 367\nLong-term debt (including current maturities):\nSenior notes $ 2,575 $ 392 $ - $ 1,505 $ - $ 4,472 $ 4,270\nTerm loans - 294 677 135 765 1,871 1,938\nOther long-term debt - 2 40 22 258 322 283\nUnamortized debt issuance costs (12) (6) (7) (6) (2) (33) (42)\nTotal long-term debt $ 2,563 $ 682 $ 710 $ 1,656 $ 1,021 $ 6,632 $ 6,449\nTotal debt $ 2,694 $ 683 $ 710 $ 1,892 $ 1,021 $ 7,000 $ 6,816\nSignificant Financing Activities\nMountaineer Credit Agreement. On October 20, 2022, Mountaineer entered into the Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement, as borrower, with a group of lenders. The Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement amends and restates a previous credit agreement and provides for borrowings up to $150 million, including a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit. Mountaineer may request an increase in the amount of loan commitments to a maximum aggregate amount of $250 million, subject to certain terms and conditions. Borrowings under the Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement can be used to finance the working capital needs of Mountaineer and for general corporate purposes. The Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire in November 2024, with an option to extend the maturity date.\nAmeriGas Propane. On September 28, 2022, AmeriGas Propane entered into the 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement, as borrower, with a group of lenders. In connection with the entering into of the 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement, the borrower paid off in full and terminated the existing AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement. The 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement provides for borrowings up to $600 million, including a $100 million sublimit for letters of credit. AmeriGas Propane may request an increase in the amount of loan commitments under the 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement to a maximum aggregate amount of $900 million, subject to certain terms and conditions. Borrowings under the 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement can be used to fund acquisitions and investments and for general corporate purposes. The 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire in September 2026.\nUGI Utilities. On July 12, 2022, UGI Utilities amended the Utilities Term Loan. The amendment extended the maturity date of the loan from October 2022 to July 2027, among other things. The current amount outstanding under the Utilities Term Loan remains unchanged and is payable in quarterly installments of $2 million, with the balance of the principal being due and payable in full at maturity. We have entered into an interest rate swap that will generally fix the underlying market-based interest rate on this variable-rate loan through June 2026.\nOn June 30, 2022, UGI Utilities entered into a note purchase agreement which provides for the private placement of (1) $90 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Senior Notes due July 15, 2032 and (2) $85 million aggregate principal amount of 4.99% Senior Notes due September 15, 2052. On July 15, 2022, UGI Utilities issued $90 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Senior Notes pursuant to the note purchase agreement. On September 15, 2022, UGI Utilities issued $85 million aggregate principal amount of 4.99% Senior Notes pursuant to the note purchase agreement. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 4.75% Senior Notes and 4.99% Senior Notes were used to reduce short-term borrowings and for general corporate purposes.\nMountaineer. On June 30, 2022, Mountaineer entered into a note purchase agreement which provides for the private placement of $40 million aggregate principal amount of 4.49% Senior Notes due August 16, 2052. On August 16, 2022, Mountaineer issued $40 million aggregate principal amount of 4.49% Senior Notes pursuant to the note purchase agreement. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 4.49% Senior Notes were used to reduce short-term borrowings and for general corporate purposes.\nUGI International. On December 7, 2021, UGI International, LLC issued, in an underwritten private placement, \u20ac400 million principal amount of the UGI International 2.50% Senior Notes due December 1, 2029. The UGI International 2.50% Senior Notes rank equal in right of payment with indebtedness issued under the UGI International Credit Facilities Agreement. The net proceeds from the UGI International 2.50% Senior Notes were used (1) to repay all of the UGI International 3.25% Senior Notes due November 1, 2025 and associated fees and expenses and (2) for general corporate purposes.\nCredit Facilities\nInformation about the Companys principal credit agreements (excluding Energy Services Receivables Facility, which is discussed below) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, is presented in the tables below.\n(Currency in millions) Expiration Date Total Capacity Borrowings Outstanding Letters of Credit and Guarantees Outstanding Available Borrowing Capacity Weighted Average Interest Rate - End of Year\nSeptember 30, 2022\nAmeriGas OLP September 2026 $ 600 $ 131 $ 2 $ 467 7.27 %\nUGI International, LLC (a) October 2023 \u20ac 300 \u20ac - \u20ac - \u20ac 300 N.A.\nEnergy Services March 2025 $ 260 $ - $ - $ 260 N.A.\nUGI Utilities June 2024 $ 350 $ 151 $ - $ 199 4.37 %\nMountaineer November 2024 $ 100 $ 85 $ - $ 15 3.82 %\nUGI Corporation (b) August 2024 $ 300 $ 252 $ - $ 48 5.62 %\nSeptember 30, 2021\nAmeriGas OLP December 2022 $ 600 $ 170 $ 60 $ 370 2.58 %\nUGI International, LLC (a) October 2023 \u20ac 300 \u20ac - \u20ac - \u20ac 300 N.A.\nEnergy Services March 2025 $ 260 $ - $ - $ 260 N.A.\nUGI Utilities June 2024 $ 350 $ 130 $ - $ 220 1.35 %\nMountaineer November 2024 $ 100 $ 67 $ - $ 33 N.M.\nUGI Corporation (b) August 2024 $ 300 $ 185 $ - $ 115 3.27 %\n(a)Permits UGI International, LLC to borrow in euros or USD.\n(b)Borrowings outstanding have been classified as Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Subsequent to September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company repaid $87 million and $70 million, respectively, of such borrowings and classified these repayments as Current maturities of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nN.A. - Not applicable\nN.M. - Not meaningful\nThe average daily and peak short-term borrowings under the Companys principal credit agreements are as follows:\n2022 2021\n(Currency in millions) Average Peak Average Peak\nAmeriGas OLP $ 181 $ 388 $ 168 $ 293\nUGI International, LLC \u20ac 77 \u20ac 250 \u20ac - \u20ac -\nEnergy Services $ - $ - $ 3 $ 32\nUGI Utilities $ 163 $ 270 $ 186 $ 279\nMountaineer $ 53 $ 85 $ 58 $ 67\nUGI Corporation $ 191 $ 288 $ 191 $ 300\nReceivables Facility. Energy Services also has a Receivables Facility with an issuer of receivables-backed commercial paper. On October 21, 2022, the expiration date of the Receivables Facility was extended to October 20, 2023. The Receivables Facility provides Energy Services with the ability to borrow up to $150 million of eligible receivables during the period October 21, 2022 through April 30, 2023, and up to $75 million of eligible receivables during the period May 1, 2023 through October 20, 2023. Energy Services uses the Receivables Facility to fund working capital, margin calls under commodity futures contracts, capital expenditures, dividends and for general corporate purposes.\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, the outstanding balance of trade receivables was $101 million and $61 million, respectively, none of which was sold to the bank. During Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, peak sales of receivables were $98 million and $87 million, respectively. During Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, average daily amounts sold were $2 million and $21 million, respectively.\nFor further information on the Companys long-term debt and credit facilities, see Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash Flows\nDue to the seasonal nature of the Companys businesses, cash flows from operating activities are generally strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for natural gas, LPG, electricity and other energy products and services consumed during the peak heating season months. Conversely, operating cash flows are generally at their lowest levels during the fourth and first fiscal quarters when the Companys investment in working capital, principally inventories and accounts receivable, is generally greatest.\nOperating Activities:\nYear-to-year variations in our cash flows from operating activities can be significantly affected by changes in operating working capital, especially during periods with significant changes in energy commodity prices. Cash flows from operating activities in Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021 were $716 million and $1,481 million, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities before changes in operating working capital were $1,269 million in Fiscal 2022 and $1,200 million in Fiscal 2021. Changes in operating working capital provided (used) operating cash flow of $(553) million in Fiscal 2022 and $281 million in Fiscal 2021. The significant increase in cash used from changes in operating working capital principally reflects derivative instruments collateral repayments of $9 million in Fiscal 2022 compared to collateral received of $472 million in Fiscal 2021 reflecting the volatility in energy commodity prices and the timing of associated collateral receipts and payments; lower cash generated from changes in accounts payable due in part to the timing of payments and the impacts of changes in commodity energy prices; and an increase in accounts receivable principally reflecting the effects of higher energy prices on receivable balances.\nInvesting Activities:\nInvesting activity cash flow is principally affected by cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment; cash paid for acquisitions of businesses and assets; investments in equity method investees; and cash proceeds from sales and retirements of property, plant and equipment. Cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment totaled $804 million in Fiscal 2022 and $690 million in Fiscal 2021. Cash payments for property, plant and equipment were higher in Fiscal 2022 compared with Fiscal 2021 reflecting, in part, higher capital expenditures at Utilities including the full-year impact of Mountaineer. Cash used for acquisitions of businesses and assets in Fiscal 2022 includes the Stonehenge Acquisition and the Pennant Acquisition in which the Company acquired the 53% interest in Pennant it did not already own. Cash used for acquisitions of businesses and assets in Fiscal 2021 reflects UGIs acquisition of Mountaineer. Cash used for investments in equity method investees was $47 million in Fiscal 2022 including investments in biomass and renewable energy projects at our Midstream & Marketing reportable segment and an investment in a renewable energy joint venture at UGI International. Cash inflows associated with investing activities during Fiscal 2022 includes cash received from the settlement of certain forward foreign currency contracts previously designated as net investment hedges. Fiscal 2021 includes cash contributions to Pine Run to fund the acquisition of Pine Run Midstream, LLC.\nFinancing Activities:\nChanges in cash flow from financing activities are primarily due to issuances and repayments of long-term debt; short-term borrowings; dividends on UGI Common Stock; and issuances or repurchases of equity instruments.\nCash flow used by financing activities was $51 million in Fiscal 2022 compared to cash flow provided by financing activities of $166 million in Fiscal 2021. During Fiscal 2022, UGI International issued \u20ac400 million principal amount of senior notes and Utilities issued a combined $215 million principal amount of senior notes. Proceeds from the UGI International senior notes were principally used to reduce existing long-term debt while proceeds from the Utilities borrowings were used to reduce short-term borrowings and for general corporate purposes. During Fiscal 2021, the Company received $213 million in net cash proceeds from the issuance of Equity Units and $215 million from the issuance of a new variable rate term loan due in May 2025. These funds were used partially to fund the Mountaineer Acquisition. During Fiscal 2021, Utilities issued $175 million of senior notes. In Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, the Company had net borrowings and (repayments) on credit facilities and the Receivables Facility of $1 million and $(35) million, respectively. Fiscal 2022 cash flow used by financing activities also includes $38 million of cash paid to repurchase Common Stock.\nCapital Expenditures\nIn the following table, we present capital expenditures (which exclude acquisitions of businesses and assets) for Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021. We also provide amounts we expect to spend in Fiscal 2023. We expect to finance a substantial portion of our Fiscal 2023 capital expenditures from cash generated by operations and cash on hand.\n(Millions of dollars) 2023\n(estimate) 2022 2021\nAmeriGas Propane $ 130 $ 128 $ 130\nUGI International 140 107 107\nMidstream & Marketing 170 38 43\nUtilities 580 562 394\nCorporate & Other 20 - -\nTotal $ 1,040 $ 835 $ 674\nThe increase in capital expenditures at Utilities during Fiscal 2022 reflects the continued execution on its infrastructure replacement and system betterment program as well as the full year impact of Mountaineer. Increased levels of capital expenditures estimated in Fiscal 2023 reflect natural gas infrastructure expansion and investments in renewable energy projects at Midstream & Marketing and UGI International; replacement and betterment projects at UGI Utilities; and expansion of Mountaineers capital expenditure programs.\nContractual Cash Obligations and Commitments\nThe Company has contractual cash obligations that extend beyond Fiscal 2022. The following table presents contractual cash obligations with non-affiliates under agreements existing as of September 30, 2022:\nPayments Due by Period\n(Millions of dollars) Total Fiscal\n2023 Fiscal\n2024 - 2025 Fiscal\n2026 - 2027 Thereafter\nShort-term borrowings (a) $ 368 $ 368 $ - $ - $ -\nLong-term debt (a) 6,665 149 2,587 2,207 1,722\nInterest on long-term fixed-rate debt (a)(b)(c) 1,971 302 489 258 922\nOperating leases 417 93 145 93 86\nAmeriGas Propane supply contracts 13 13 - - -\nUGI International supply contracts 238 238 - - -\nMidstream & Marketing supply contracts 1,670 576 391 155 548\nUtilities construction, supply, storage and transportation contracts 683 197 231 152 103\nDerivative instruments (d) 213 150 150 62 1 -\nTotal $ 12,238 $ 2,086 $ 3,905 $ 2,866 $ 3,381\n(a)Based upon stated maturity dates for debt outstanding at September 30, 2022.\n(b)Based upon stated interest rates adjusted for the effects of interest rate swaps.\n(c)Calculated using applicable interest rates or forward interest rate curves, and UGIs and its subsidiaries leverage ratios, as of September 30, 2022.\n(d)Represents the sum of amounts due if derivative instrument liabilities were settled at the September 30, 2022 amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet (but excluding amounts associated with interest rate contracts).\nOther noncurrent liabilities included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2022, principally comprise operating lease liabilities (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements); regulatory liabilities (see Note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements); refundable tank and cylinder deposits (as further described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Refundable Tank and Cylinder Deposits); litigation, property and casualty liabilities and obligations under environmental remediation agreements (see Note 17 to Consolidated Financial Statements); pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities recorded in accordance with accounting guidance relating to employee retirement plans (see Note 8 to Consolidated Financial Statements); and liabilities associated with executive compensation plans (see Note 14 to Consolidated Financial Statements). These liabilities, with the exception of operating lease liabilities, are not included in the\ntable of Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments because they are estimates of future payments and not contractually fixed as to timing or amount. Required minimum contributions to the U.S. Pension Plans (as further described below under U.S. Pension Plans) in Fiscal 2023 are not expected to be material. Required minimum contributions to the U.S. Pension Plans in years beyond Fiscal 2023 will depend, in large part, on the impacts of future returns on pension plan assets and interest rates on pension plan liabilities.\nU.S. Pension Plans\nThe U.S. Pension Plans consist of (1) a defined benefit pension plan for employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, of UGI, UGI Utilities, and certain of UGIs other domestic wholly owned subsidiaries, and (2) a defined benefit pension plan for substantially all Mountaineer employees. The fair values of the U.S. Pension Plans assets totaled $525 million and $717 million at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the underfunded positions of the U.S. Pension Plans, defined as the excess of the PBO over the U.S. Pension Plans assets, were $82 million and $109 million, respectively.\nWe believe we are in compliance with regulations governing defined benefit pension plans, including the ERISA rules and regulations. Required minimum contributions to the U.S. Pension Plans in Fiscal 2023 are not expected to be material. Pre-tax pension cost associated with the U.S. Pension Plans in Fiscal 2022 was not material. Pre-tax pension cost associated with the U.S. Pension Plans in Fiscal 2023 is not expected to be material.\nGAAP guidance associated with pension and other postretirement plans generally requires recognition of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position reflecting the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans with current year changes recognized in shareholders equity unless such amounts are subject to regulatory recovery. At September 30, 2022, we have recorded after-tax charges to UGI Corporations stockholders equity of $14 million and recorded regulatory assets totaling $114 million in order to reflect the funded status of the U.S. Pension Plans. For a more detailed discussion of the U.S. Pension Plans and our other postretirement benefit plans, see Note 8 to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRelated Party Transactions\nDuring Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, we did not enter into any related-party transactions that had a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nUGI primarily enters into guarantee arrangements on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries. These arrangements are not subject to the recognition and measurement guidance relating to guarantees under GAAP.\nWe do not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements that are expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, change in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nUtility Regulatory Matters\nBase Rate Filings. On January 28, 2022, PA Gas Utility filed a request with the PAPUC to increase its base operating revenues for residential, commercial and industrial customers by $83 million annually. On September 15, 2022, the PAPUC issued a final order approving a settlement providing for a $49 million annual base distribution rate increase for PA Gas Utility, through a phased approach, with $38 million beginning October 29, 2022 and an additional $11 million beginning October 1, 2023. In accordance with the terms of the final order, PA Gas Utility will not be permitted to file a rate case prior to January 1, 2024. Also in accordance with the terms of the final order, PA Gas Utility is authorized to implement a weather normalization adjustment rider as a 5-year pilot program beginning on the effective date of the new rates. Under this rider, customer billings for distribution services will be adjusted monthly to reflect normal weather conditions if weather deviates more than 3% from normal. Additionally, under the terms of the final order, PA Gas Utility will be authorized to implement a DSIC once its total property, plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation reaches $3,368 million (which threshold was achieved in September 2022).\nOn February 8, 2021, Electric Utility filed a rate request with the PAPUC to increase its annual base distribution revenues by $9 million. On October 28, 2021, the PAPUC issued a final order approving a settlement that permitted Electric Utility, effective November 9, 2021, to increase its base distribution revenues by $6 million.\nOn January 28, 2020, PA Gas Utility filed a request with the PAPUC to increase its annual base distribution operating revenues by $75 million annually. On October 8, 2020, the PAPUC issued a final Order approving a settlement that permitted PA Gas\nUtility to increase its annual base distribution rates by $20 million, through a phased approach, with $10 million beginning January 1, 2021 and an additional $10 million beginning July 1, 2021. Additionally, PA Gas Utility was authorized to implement a DSIC once PA Gas Utility total property, plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation reached $2,875 million. This threshold was achieved in December 2020, and PA Gas Utility implemented a DSIC effective April 1, 2021. The PAPUCs final order also included enhanced COVID-19 customer assistance measures, including the establishment of an Emergency Relief Program for a defined set of payment troubled customers (ERP). Additionally, the PAPUCs final order permitted PA Gas Utility to establish a regulatory asset for certain incremental expenses attributable to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, most notably expenses related to the ERP and uncollectible accounts expense, through the effective date of rates in the next PA Gas Utility base rate case, to be recovered and amortized over a 10-year period. In accordance with the terms of the final order, PA Gas Utility was not permitted to file a rate case prior to January 1, 2022.\nMarket Risk Disclosures\nOur primary market risk exposures are (1) commodity price risk; (2) interest rate risk; and (3) foreign currency exchange rate risk. Although we use derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market price risk associated with forecasted transactions, we do not use derivative financial and commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nCommodity Price Risk\nThe risk associated with fluctuations in the prices the Partnership and our UGI International operations pay for LPG is principally a result of market forces reflecting changes in supply and demand for LPG and other energy commodities. Their profitability is sensitive to changes in LPG supply costs. Increases in supply costs are generally passed on to customers. The Partnership and UGI International may not, however, always be able to pass through product cost increases fully or on a timely basis, particularly when product costs rise rapidly. In order to reduce the volatility of LPG market price risk, the Partnership uses contracts for the forward purchase or sale of propane, propane fixed-price supply agreements and over-the-counter derivative commodity instruments including price swap and option contracts. Our UGI International operations use over-the-counter derivative commodity instruments and may from time to time enter into other derivative contracts, similar to those used by the Partnership, to reduce market risk associated with a portion of their LPG purchases. Over-the-counter derivative commodity instruments used to economically hedge forecasted purchases of LPG are generally settled at expiration of the contract.\nUtilities tariffs contain clauses that permit recovery of all prudently incurred costs of natural gas it sells to its retail core-market customers, including the cost of financial instruments used to hedge purchased gas costs. The recovery clauses provide for periodic adjustments for the difference between the total amounts actually billed to customers through PGC and PGA rates and the recoverable costs incurred. Because of this ratemaking mechanism, there is limited commodity price risk associated with our Utilities operations. PA Gas Utility uses derivative financial instruments, including natural gas futures and option contracts traded on the NYMEX, to reduce volatility in the cost of gas it purchases for its retail core-market customers. The cost of these derivative financial instruments, net of any associated gains or losses, is included in PA Gas Utility's PGC recovery mechanism.\nIn order to manage market price risk relating to substantially all of Midstream & Marketings fixed-price sale contracts for physical natural gas and electricity, Midstream & Marketing enters into NYMEX, ICE and over-the-counter natural gas and electricity futures and option contracts, and natural gas basis swap contracts or enters into fixed-price supply arrangements. Midstream & Marketing also uses NYMEX and over-the-counter electricity futures contracts to economically hedge a portion of its anticipated sales of electricity from its electricity generation facilities. Although Midstream & Marketings fixed-price supply arrangements mitigate most risks associated with its fixed-price sales contracts, should any of the suppliers under these arrangements fail to perform, increases, if any, in the cost of replacement natural gas or electricity would adversely impact Midstream & Marketings results. In order to reduce this risk of supplier nonperformance, Midstream & Marketing has diversified its purchases across a number of suppliers. UGI Internationals natural gas and electricity marketing businesses also use natural gas and electricity futures and forward contracts to economically hedge market risk associated with a substantial portion of anticipated volumes under fixed-price sales and purchase contracts.\nMidstream & Marketing has entered into fixed-price sales agreements for a portion of the electricity expected to be generated by its electric generation assets. In the event that these generation assets would not be able to produce all of the electricity needed to supply electricity under these agreements, Midstream & Marketing would be required to purchase electricity on the spot market or under contract with other electricity suppliers. Accordingly, increases in the cost of replacement power could negatively impact Midstream & Marketings results.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe have both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates impact the cash flows of variable-rate debt but generally do not impact their fair value. Conversely, changes in interest rates impact the fair value of fixed-rate debt but do not impact their cash flows.\nOur variable-rate debt at September 30, 2022, includes revolving credit facility borrowings and variable-rate term loans at UGI International, Utilities, Energy Services and UGI Corporation. These debt agreements have interest rates that are generally indexed to short-term market interest rates. We have entered into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap agreements on all or a significant portion of the term loans principal balances and all or a significant portion of the term loans tenor. We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. At September 30, 2022, combined borrowings outstanding under variable-rate debt agreements, excluding the previously mentioned effectively fixed-rate debt, totaled $800 million. Based upon average borrowings outstanding under variable-rate borrowings (excluding effectively fixed-rate term loan debt), an increase in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased our Fiscal 2022 interest expense by approximately $8 million. The remainder of our debt outstanding is subject to fixed rates of interest. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would result in decreases in the fair value of this fixed-rate debt of approximately $165 million at September 30, 2022. A 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in increases in the fair value of this fixed-rate debt of approximately $265 million at September 30, 2022.\nLong-term debt associated with our domestic businesses is typically issued at fixed rates of interest based upon market rates for debt with similar terms and credit ratings. As these long-term debt issues mature, we may refinance such debt with new debt having interest rates reflecting then-current market conditions. In order to reduce interest rate risk associated with near- to medium-term forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt, from time to time we enter into IRPAs.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nOur primary currency exchange rate risk is associated with the USD versus the euro and, to a lesser extent, the USD versus the British pound sterling. The USD value of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities will fluctuate with changes in the associated foreign currency exchange rates. From time to time, we use derivative instruments to hedge portions of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries, including anticipated foreign currency denominated dividends. Gains or losses on these net investment hedges remain in AOCI until such foreign operations are sold or liquidated. With respect to our net investments in our UGI International operations, a 10% decline in the value of the associated foreign currencies versus the USD would reduce their aggregate net book value at September 30, 2022, by approximately $180 million, which amount would be reflected in other comprehensive income. We have designated certain euro-denominated borrowings as net investment hedges.\nIn order to reduce the volatility in net income associated with our foreign operations, principally as a result of changes in the USD exchange rate between the euro and British pound sterling, we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. We layer in these foreign currency exchange contracts over a multi-year period to eventually equal approximately 90% of anticipated UGI International foreign currency earnings before income taxes.\nDerivative Instrument Credit Risk\nWe are exposed to risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our derivative instrument counterparties. Our derivative instrument counterparties principally comprise large energy companies and major U.S. and international financial institutions. We maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe reduce overall credit risk. These policies include evaluating and monitoring our counterparties financial condition, including their credit ratings, and entering into agreements with counterparties that govern credit limits or entering into netting agreements that allow for offsetting counterparty receivable and payable balances for certain financial transactions, as deemed appropriate.\nWe have concentrations of credit risk associated with derivative instruments and we evaluate the creditworthiness of our derivative counterparties on an ongoing basis. As of September 30, 2022, the maximum amount of loss, based upon the gross fair values of the derivative instruments, we would incur if these counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of their contracts was $2,418 million. In general, many of our over-the-counter derivative instruments and all exchange contracts call for the posting of collateral by the counterparty or by the Company in the forms of letters of credit, parental guarantees or cash. At September 30, 2022, we had received cash collateral from derivative instrument counterparties totaling $398 million. In addition, we may have offsetting derivative liabilities and certain accounts payable balances with certain of these counterparties, which further mitigates the previously mentioned maximum amount of losses. Certain of the Partnerships derivative contracts have credit-risk-related contingent features that may require the posting of additional collateral in the event\nof a downgrade of the Partnerships debt rating. At September 30, 2022, if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered, the amount of collateral required to be posted would not be material.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of unsettled market risk sensitive derivative instrument assets (liabilities) held at September 30, 2022 and changes in their fair values due to market risks. Certain of UGI Utilities commodity derivative instruments are excluded from the table below because any associated net gains or losses are refundable to or recoverable from customers in accordance with UGI Utilities ratemaking.\nAsset (Liability)\n(Millions of dollars) Fair Value Change in\nFair Value\nSeptember 30, 2022\nCommodity price risk (1) $ 1,715 $ (353)\nInterest rate risk (2) $ 66 $ (11)\nForeign currency exchange rate risk (3) $ 117 $ (47)\n(1)Change in fair value represents a 10% adverse change in the market prices of certain commodities\n(2)Change in fair value represents a 50 basis point adverse change in prevailing market interest rates\n(3)Change in fair value represents a 10% adverse change in the value of the Euro and the British pound sterling versus the USD.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe accounting policies and estimates discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. The application of these accounting policies and estimates necessarily requires managements most subjective or complex judgments regarding estimates and projected outcomes of future events. Changes in these policies and estimates could have a material effect on our financial statements. Management has reviewed these critical accounting policies, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, with the Companys Audit Committee. Also, see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements which discusses our significant accounting policies.\nGoodwill Impairment Evaluation. Our goodwill is the result of business acquisitions. We do not amortize goodwill, but test it at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment (a component), if it constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. Components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. A reporting unit with goodwill is required to perform an impairment test annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired.\nFor certain of our reporting units with goodwill, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of such reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. For our other reporting units with goodwill, we bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative assessment by comparing the fair values of the reporting units with their carrying amounts, including goodwill. We determine fair values generally based on a weighting of income and market approaches. For purposes of the income approach, fair values are determined based upon the present value of the reporting units estimated future cash flows, including an estimate of the reporting units terminal value based upon these cash flows, discounted at appropriate risk-adjusted rates. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows, which may include estimates of long-term future growth rates based upon our most recent reviews of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit. Cash flow estimates used to establish fair values under our income approach involve management judgments based on a broad range of information and historical results. In addition, external economic and competitive conditions can influence future performance. For purposes of the market approach, we use valuation multiples for companies comparable to our reporting units. The market approach requires judgment to determine the appropriate valuation multiples. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such excess but not to exceed the total amount of the goodwill of the reporting unit. As of September 30, 2022, our goodwill totaled $3,612 million. No impairments of goodwill were recorded during any of the periods presented.\nWith respect to the AmeriGas Propane reporting units Fiscal 2022 impairment test, we determined that AmeriGas Propanes fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 30%. While the Company believes that its judgments used in the quantitative assessment of AmeriGas Propanes fair value are reasonable based upon currently available facts and circumstances, if AmeriGas Propane were not able to achieve its anticipated results and/or if its weighted average cost of capital were to increase, its fair value would be adversely affected, which may result in an impairment. There is approximately $2\nbillion of goodwill in this reporting unit as of September 30, 2022. The Company will continue to monitor its reporting units and related goodwill for any possible future non-cash impairment charges.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. An impairment test for long-lived assets (or an asset group) is required when circumstances indicate that such assets may be impaired. If it is determined that a triggering event has occurred, we perform a recoverability test based upon estimated undiscounted cash flow projections expected to be realized over the remaining useful life of the long-lived asset. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the long-lived asset's carrying amount, we determine its fair value. If the fair value is determined to be less than its carrying amount, the long-lived asset is reduced to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such shortfall. When determining whether a long-lived asset has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has identifiable cash flows. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets involves judgment in areas such as identifying when a triggering event requiring evaluation occurs; identifying and grouping assets; and, if the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the long-lived asset's carrying amount, determining the fair value of the long-lived asset. Although cash flow estimates are based upon relevant information at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are by nature highly uncertain and contemplate factors that change over time such as the expected use of the asset including future production and sales volumes, expected fluctuations in prices of commodities and expected proceeds from disposition. See Note 5 to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the impairment loss associated with the disposal of Conemaugh during the third quarter of Fiscal 2020. No other material provisions for impairments of long-lived assets were recorded during Fiscal 2022 or Fiscal 2021.\nLoss Contingencies and Environmental Remediation Liabilities. We are involved in litigation that arises in the normal course of business, and we are subject to risk of loss for general, automobile and product liability and workers compensation claims for which we obtain insurance coverage subject to self-insured retentions or deductibles. We are also subject to environmental laws and regulations intended to mitigate or remove the effects of past operations and improve or maintain the quality of the environment. These laws and regulations require the removal or remedy of the effect on the environment of the disposal or release of certain specified hazardous substances at current or former operating sites.\nWe establish reserves for loss contingencies including pending litigation, and for pending and incurred but not reported claims associated with general and product liability, automobile and workers compensation when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount or range of amounts related to such liability can be reasonably estimated. When no amount within a range of possible loss is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, liabilities recorded are based upon the low end of the range. With respect to unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents, we may use the work of specialists to estimate the ultimate losses to be incurred using actuarially determined loss development factors applied to actual claims data.\nThe likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular loss contingency is often difficult to predict. In addition, a reasonable estimate of the loss, or a range of possible loss, may not be practicable based upon the information available and the potential effects of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the loss contingency. Reasonable estimates involve management judgments based on a broad range of information and prior experience. For litigation and pending claims including those covered by insurance policies, the analysis of probable loss is performed on a case by case basis and includes an evaluation of the nature of the claim, the procedural status of the matter, the probability or likelihood of success in prosecuting or defending the claim, the information available with respect to the claim, the opinions and views of outside counsel and other advisors, and past experience in similar matters. These judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received, and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary. Our estimated reserves for loss contingencies and for pending and incurred but not reported claims associated with general and product liability, automobile and workers compensation may differ materially from the ultimate liability and such reserves may change materially as more information becomes available and estimated reserves are adjusted.\nWe accrue reserves for environmental remediation when assessments indicate that it is probable a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Amounts recorded as environmental liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represent our best estimate of costs expected to be incurred or, if no best estimate can be made, the minimum liability associated with a range of expected environmental investigation and remediation costs. These estimates are based upon a number of factors including whether the company will be responsible for such remediation, the scope and cost of the remediation work to be performed, the portion of costs that will be shared with other potentially responsible parties, the timing of the remediation and possible impact of changes in technology, and the regulations and requirements of local governmental authorities. Our estimated reserves for environmental remediation may differ materially from the ultimate liability and such reserves may change materially as more information becomes available and estimated reserves are adjusted. PA Gas Utility receives ratemaking recognition of environmental investigation and remediation costs associated with its in-state environmental sites. This ratemaking recognition balances the accumulated difference between historical costs and rate recoveries with an estimate of future costs associated with the sites.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities. The accounting for our rate regulated gas and electric utility businesses differs from the accounting for nonregulated operations in that these businesses are required to reflect the effects of rate regulation in the consolidated financial statements. Regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated businesses. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies are deferred as regulatory assets. Similarly, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. We continually assess whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by evaluating the regulatory environment, recent rate orders and public statements issued by the PAPUC, WVPSC and MDPSC, and discussions with regulatory authorities and legal counsel. If future recovery of regulatory assets ceases to be probable, the elimination of those regulatory assets would adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. As of September 30, 2022, our regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities totaled $340 million and $335 million, respectively. For additional information on regulatory assets and liabilities, see Notes 2 and 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Positions taken by an entity in its tax returns must satisfy a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold assuming the positions will be examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of relevant information. We use assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes. We also use assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset. The interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax give consideration to current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax law or our interpretation thereof and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the amount of deferred income taxes take into account estimates of the amount of future taxable income. Actual taxable income or future estimates of taxable income could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates inaccurate. Changes in the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ significantly from our estimates. As of September 30, 2022, our net deferred tax liabilities totaled $1,249 million.\nBusiness Combination Purchase Price Allocations. From time to time, the Company enters into material business combinations. The purchase price is allocated to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. From time to time, we engage third-party valuation experts to assist us in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include, but are not limited to, discount rates and expected future cash flows from and the economic lives of customer relationships, trade names, existing technology, and other intangible assets. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates. The allocation of the purchase price may be modified up to one year after the acquisition date, under certain circumstances, as more information is obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the effects of recently issued accounting guidance.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n(a)The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company's management, with the participation of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2022, were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\n(b)Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).\nInternal control over financial reporting refers to the process, designed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, and effected by the Companys Board of Directors, to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changing conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nBased on its assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. This report is set forth below.\n(c)During the most recent fiscal quarter, no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting occurred that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of UGI Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited UGI Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, UGI Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes and the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated November 21, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nNovember 21, 2022 ITEM 9B.

Jastrzebski\nChief Financial Officer\n/s/ Jean Felix Tematio Dontsop\nChief Accounting Officer\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of UGI Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UGI Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes and the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 21, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of general liability, automobile and workers compensation reserves\nDescription of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to risk of loss for general liability, automobile and workers compensation claims for which it obtains coverage under insurance policies that are subject to self-insured retentions or deductibles. The Company establishes reserves for pending and incurred but not reported claims associated with general liability, automobile and workers compensation when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount or range of amounts can be reasonably estimated.\nAuditing the Companys general liability, automobile and workers compensation reserves was complex and required us to involve our actuarial specialists due to the significant measurement uncertainty associated with the estimate and the use of actuarial methods. In addition, the reserve estimate is sensitive to significant management assumptions, including the loss development factors for reported claims.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys valuation of general liability, automobile and workers compensation reserves. For example, we tested controls over managements review of the appropriateness of the assumptions used in the calculations and the completeness and accuracy of the data underlying the reserves.\nTo test the valuation of general liability, automobile and workers compensation reserves, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the methodologies used to estimate the reserves and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. We involved our actuarial specialists to assist in evaluating the significant assumptions and actuarial methodologies used by the Company to estimate the total expected losses for claims. We also performed a search for unrecorded claims reserves related to claims incurred prior to the balance sheet date through examination of subsequent payments and other supporting documentation to determine if unrecorded claims affect the loss reserve estimation process or reserve balance.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2014.\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nNovember 21, 2022\nUGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Millions of dollars)\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 405 $ 855\nRestricted cash 64 22\nAccounts receivable (less allowances for doubtful accounts of $64 and $53, respectively)\n1,127 880\nAccrued utility revenues 23 15\nIncome taxes receivable 128 128\nInventories 665 469\nDerivative instruments 865 665\nPrepaid expenses 110 135\nHeld for sale assets (Note 25)\n295 -\nOther current assets 120 101\nTotal current assets 3,802 3,270\nProperty, plant and equipment\nNon-utility 6,656 6,486\nUtility 5,550 5,022\n12,206 11,508\nAccumulated depreciation (4,166) (3,950)\nNet property, plant, and equipment 8,040 7,558\nGoodwill 3,612 3,770\nIntangible assets, net 500 583\nUtility regulatory assets 301 373\nDerivative instruments 565 338\nOther assets 755 831\nTotal assets $ 17,575 $ 16,723\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt $ 149 $ 110\nShort-term borrowings 368 367\nAccounts payable 891 837\nEmployee compensation and benefits accrued 147 181\nDeposits and advances 225 208\nDerivative instruments 144 60\nHeld for sale liabilities (Note 25)\n19 -\nOther current liabilities 501 534\nTotal current liabilities 2,444 2,297\nNoncurrent liabilities\nLong-term debt 6,483 6,339\nDeferred income taxes 1,305 1,137\nDerivative instruments 50 38\nOther noncurrent liabilities 1,219 1,381\nTotal liabilities 11,501 11,192\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 17)\nEquity:\nUGI Corporation stockholders equity:\nPreferred Stock, without par value (authorized 5,000,000 shares; issued 220,000 and 220,000 Series A shares, respectively)\n162 213\nUGI Common Stock, without par value (authorized -

In the U.S., we own and operate (1) a retail propane marketing and distribution business; (2) natural gas and electric distribution utilities; and (3) energy marketing, midstream infrastructure, storage, natural gas gathering and processing, natural gas production, electricity generation and energy services businesses. In Europe, we market and distribute propane and other LPG, and market other energy products and services.\nWe conduct a domestic propane marketing and distribution business through AmeriGas Partners. AmeriGas Partners conducts a national propane distribution business through its principal operating subsidiary AmeriGas OLP. AmeriGas Partners and AmeriGas OLP are Delaware limited partnerships. UGIs wholly owned second-tier subsidiary, AmeriGas Propane, Inc., serves as the general partner of AmeriGas Partners.\nUGI International, through subsidiaries and affiliates, conducts (1) an LPG distribution business throughout much of Europe and (2) an energy marketing business in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. These businesses are conducted principally through our subsidiaries, UGI France, Flaga, AvantiGas, DVEP and UniverGas. See Note 25 for additional information regarding the October 2022 sale of the United Kingdom energy marketing business and the November 2022 announcement related to the France energy marketing business.\nEnergy Services conducts, directly and through subsidiaries and affiliates, energy marketing, including RNG, midstream transmission, LNG storage, natural gas gathering and processing, natural gas and RNG production, electricity generation and energy services businesses primarily in the eastern region of the U.S., eastern Ohio, the panhandle of West Virginia and\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nCalifornia. UGID owns electricity generation facilities principally located in Pennsylvania. Energy Services and its subsidiaries storage, LNG and portions of its midstream transmission operations are subject to regulation by the FERC.\nUpon acquisition of Mountaineer on September, 1, 2021, our Utilities segment includes UGI Utilities and Mountaintop Energy Holdings, LLC. For additional information on the Mountaineer Acquisition, see Note 5. PA Gas Utility serves customers in eastern and central Pennsylvania and in portions of one Maryland county, and Mountaineer serves customers in West Virginia. Electric Utility serves customers in portions of Luzerne and Wyoming counties in northeastern Pennsylvania. PA Gas Utility is subject to regulation by the PAPUC and FERC and, with respect to its customers in Maryland, the MDPSC. Mountaineer is subject to regulation by the WVPSC and FERC. Electric Utility is subject to regulation by the PAPUC and FERC.\nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and costs. These estimates are based on managements knowledge of current events, historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results may be different from these estimates and assumptions.\nFor purposes of comparability, certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2022, the Company reclassified certain amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity related to the accounting for the Equity Units issued in May 2021.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of UGI and its controlled subsidiary companies which are majority owned. We report outside ownership interests in other consolidated but less than 100%-owned subsidiaries, as noncontrolling interests. We eliminate intercompany accounts and transactions when we consolidate.\nWe account for privately held equity securities of entities without readily determinable fair values in which we do not have control, but have significant influence over operating and financial policies, under the equity method. See Note 22 for more information on our equity method investments. Investments in equity securities related to entities in which we do not have significant influence over operating and financial policies are generally initially valued at their cost less impairment (if any) and subsequently remeasured at fair value, as applicable, in accordance with the relevant provisions under GAAP.\nEffects of Regulation\nCertain of our subsidiaries account for the financial effects of regulation in accordance with ASC 980. In accordance with this guidance, incurred costs that would otherwise be charged to expense are capitalized and recorded as regulatory assets when it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered through rates in the future. Similarly, we recognize regulatory liabilities when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have not yet been incurred. Regulatory assets and liabilities are classified as current if, upon initial recognition, the entire amount related to that item will be recovered or refunded within a year of the balance sheet date. Generally, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are amortized into expense and income over the periods authorized by the respective regulatory body. For additional information regarding the effects of rate regulation on our utility operations, see Note 9.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company applies fair value measurements on a recurring and, as otherwise required under ASC 820, on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements performed on a recurring basis principally relate to derivative instruments and investments held in supplemental executive retirement plan grantor trusts.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). A level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nWe use the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived from observable market data by correlation or other means.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability including situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.\nFair value is based upon assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and risks inherent in valuation techniques and inputs to valuations. This includes not only the credit standing of counterparties and credit enhancements but also the impact of our own nonperformance risk on our liabilities. We evaluate the need for credit adjustments to our derivative instrument fair values. These credit adjustments were not material to the fair values of our derivative instruments.\nDerivative Instruments\nDerivative instruments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values, unless the NPNS exception is elected. The accounting for changes in fair value depends upon the purpose of the derivative instrument, whether it is subject to regulatory ratemaking mechanisms or if it qualifies and is designated as a hedge for accounting purposes.\nCertain of our derivative instruments qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. For cash flow hedges, changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments are recorded in AOCI, to the extent effective at offsetting changes in the hedged item, until earnings are affected by the hedged item. We discontinue cash flow hedge accounting if occurrence of the forecasted transaction is determined to be no longer probable. Hedge accounting is also discontinued for derivatives that cease to be highly effective. We do not designate our commodity and certain foreign currency derivative instruments as hedges under GAAP. Changes in the fair values of these derivative instruments are reflected in net income. Gains and losses on substantially all of the commodity derivative instruments used by Utilities are included in regulatory assets or liabilities because it is probable such gains or losses will be recoverable from, or refundable to, customers. From time to time, we also enter into net investment hedges. Gains and losses on net investment hedges that relate to our foreign operations are included in the cumulative translation adjustment component in AOCI until such foreign net investment is substantially sold or liquidated.\nCash flows from derivative instruments, other than certain cross-currency swaps and net investment hedges, if any, are included in cash flows from operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash flows from the interest portion of our cross-currency hedges, if any, are included in cash flows from operating activities while cash flows from the currency portion of such hedges, if any, are included in cash flows from financing activities. Cash flows from net investment hedges, if any, are included in cash flows from investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFor a more detailed description of the derivative instruments we use, our accounting for derivatives, our objectives for using them and other information, see Note 19.\nBusiness Combination Purchase Price Allocations\nFrom time to time, the Company enters into material business combinations. The purchase price is allocated to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. Fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon available information. Estimating fair values is generally subject to significant judgment, estimates and assumptions especially with respect to\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nintangible assets. The allocation of the purchase price may be modified up to one year after the acquisition date, under certain circumstances, as more information is obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nForeign Currency Translation\nBalance sheets of international subsidiaries are translated into USD using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Income statements and equity investee results are translated into USD using an average exchange rate for each reporting period. Where the local currency is the functional currency, translation adjustments are recorded in other comprehensive income. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise with the impact of subsequent changes in such rates reflected in the income statement. The functional currency of a significant portion of our international operations is the euro.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Certain revenues such as revenue from leases, financial instruments and other revenues are not within the scope of ASC 606 because they are not from contracts with customers. Such revenues are accounted for in accordance with other GAAP. Revenue-related taxes collected on behalf of customers and remitted to taxing authorities, principally sales and use taxes, are not included in revenues. Gross receipts taxes at Midstream & Marketing, Mountaineer and Electric Utility are presented on a gross basis. The Company has elected to use the practical expedient to expense the costs to obtain contracts when incurred for contracts that have a term less than one year. The costs incurred to obtain contracts that have durations of longer than one year are not material. See Note 4 for additional disclosures regarding the Companys revenue from contracts with customers.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the gross outstanding amount adjusted for an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable that are acquired are initially recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. Provisions for uncollectible accounts are established based upon our collection experience, the assessment of the collectability of specific amounts and the Companys best estimate of current expected credit losses. Accounts receivable are written off in the period in which the receivable is deemed uncollectible.\nLPG Delivery Expenses\nExpenses associated with the delivery of LPG to customers of the Partnership and our UGI International operations (including vehicle expenses, expenses of delivery personnel, vehicle repair and maintenance and general liability expenses) are classified as Operating and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Depreciation expense associated with the Partnership and UGI International delivery vehicles is classified in Depreciation and amortization on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nIncome Taxes\nAmeriGas Partners and AmeriGas OLP are not directly subject to federal income taxes. Instead, their taxable income or loss is allocated to the individual partners. We record income taxes on (1) our share of the Partnerships current taxable income or loss and (2) the differences between the book and tax basis of our investment in the Partnership. AmeriGas OLP has subsidiaries which operate in corporate form and are directly subject to federal and state income taxes. Legislation in certain states allows for taxation of partnership income and the accompanying financial statements reflect state income taxes resulting from such legislation.\nUtilities records deferred income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income resulting from the use of accelerated tax depreciation methods based upon amounts recognized for ratemaking purposes. Utilities also records a deferred income tax liability for tax benefits, principally the result of accelerated tax depreciation for state income tax purposes, that are flowed through to ratepayers when temporary differences originate and records a regulatory income tax asset for the probable increase in future revenues that will result when the temporary differences reverse.\nWe record interest on underpayments and overpayments of income taxes, and income tax penalties, in Income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest income or expense recognized in Income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income was not material for all periods presented.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nEarnings Per Common Share\nBasic earnings per share attributable to UGI Corporation stockholders reflect the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share attributable to UGI Corporation include the effects of dilutive stock options, common stock awards and Equity Units. Shares used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:\n(Thousands of shares) 2022 2021 2020\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding for basic computation 209,940 209,063 208,928\nIncremental shares issuable for stock options, common stock awards and Equity Units (a) (b) 5,881 3,063 941\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding for diluted computation 215,821 212,126 209,869\n(a)Fiscal 2022 and 2021 includes the impact of common shares assumed to be outstanding under the if-converted method in connection with the May 2021 issuance of Equity Units (see Note 13).\n(b)For Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 there were 8,138 shares, 5,267 shares and 7,056 shares, respectively, associated with outstanding stock option awards that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect was antidilutive.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Restricted cash principally represents those cash balances in our commodity futures brokerage accounts that are restricted from withdrawal.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to the corresponding amounts reported on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n2022 2021 2020\nCash and cash equivalents $ 405 $ 855 $ 336\nRestricted cash 64 22 21\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 469 $ 877 $ 357\nInventories\nOur inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We determine cost using an average cost method for non-utility LPG and natural gas and utility inventories; specific identification for appliances; and the FIFO method for all other inventories.\nThe Company accounts for renewable energy certificates as inventory, which generally represents costs incurred to generate a certificate for sale. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of renewable energy certificates when control of the certificate is transferred to the buyer, and the cost of the certificate, if any, is then recorded within Cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Related Depreciation\nWe record property, plant and equipment at the lower of original cost or fair value, if impaired. Capitalized costs include labor, materials and other direct and indirect costs, and for certain operations subject to cost-of-service rate regulation, AFUDC. We also include in property, plant and equipment costs associated with computer software we develop or obtain for use in our businesses. The amounts assigned to property, plant and equipment of acquired businesses are based upon estimated fair value at date of acquisition. When we retire or otherwise dispose of non-utility plant and equipment, we eliminate the associated cost and accumulated depreciation and recognize any resulting gain or loss in \"Other operating income, net\" on the Consolidated Statements of Income. For property subject to cost of service rate regulation, upon retirement we charge the original cost to accumulated depreciation for financial accounting purposes. Costs incurred to retire UGI Utilities plant and equipment, net of salvage, are recorded in regulatory assets and amortized over five years, consistent with prior ratemaking treatment.\nWe record depreciation expense on non-utility plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over estimated economic useful lives. We record depreciation expense for Utilities plant and equipment on a straight-line basis based upon the projected\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nservice lives of the various classes of its depreciable property. We classify amortization of computer software and related IT system installation costs included in property, plant and equipment as depreciation expense. No depreciation expense is included in cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nIntangible Assets. We amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives unless we determine their lives to be indefinite. Estimated useful lives of definite-lived intangible assets, primarily consisting of customer relationships. We test definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the associated carrying amounts may be impaired. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the estimated fair value of the asset in accordance with ASC 820. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually (and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that it is more likely than not that they are impaired) and written down to fair value, if impaired. See Note 12 for additional information related to an intangible asset impairment recognized in Fiscal 2021.\nGoodwill. We do not amortize goodwill, but test it at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment (a component) if it constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. Components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. Each of our reporting units with goodwill is required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired.\nFor certain of our reporting units with goodwill, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of such reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. For our other reporting units with goodwill, we bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative assessment by comparing the fair values of the reporting units with their carrying amounts, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such excess but not to exceed the total amount of the goodwill of the reporting unit.\nWith respect to the AmeriGas Propane reporting units Fiscal 2022 impairment test, the Company bypassed the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative assessment. Such assessment used a weighting of income and market approaches to determine fair value. For the income approach we used managements best estimates of future anticipated cash flow performance included in AmeriGas Propanes latest budget and plan, discounted based upon AmeriGas Propanes weighted average cost of debt and equity. We also used valuation multiples to determine an estimated fair value using recent transaction market multiples for retail propane distribution companies in the U.S. Based upon weighting the fair values estimated using the income and market approaches above, we determined that AmeriGas Propanes fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 30%. While the Company believes that its judgments used in the quantitative assessment of AmeriGas Propanes fair value are reasonable based upon currently available facts and circumstances, if AmeriGas Propane were not able to achieve its anticipated results and/or if its weighted average cost of capital were to increase, its fair value would be adversely affected, which may result in an impairment. There is approximately $2 billion of goodwill in this reporting unit as of September 30, 2022. The Company will continue to monitor its reporting units and related goodwill for any possible future non-cash impairment charges.\nThere were no accumulated goodwill impairment losses at September 30, 2022 and 2021, and no provisions for goodwill impairments were recognized for all periods presented. For further information on our goodwill and intangible assets, see Note 12.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nImpairment testing for long-lived assets (or an asset group) is required when circumstances indicate that such assets may be impaired. If it is determined that a triggering event has occurred, we perform a recoverability test based upon estimated undiscounted cash flow projections expected to be realized over the remaining useful life of the long-lived asset. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the long-lived asset's carrying amount, we determine its fair value. If the fair value is determined to be less than its carrying amount, the long-lived asset is reduced to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such shortfall. When determining whether a long-lived asset has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has identifiable cash flows.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nNo material provisions for impairments of long-lived assets were recorded during Fiscal 2022. See Note 5 for further information on the losses associated with assets held for sale and the dispositions of Conemaugh and HVAC during Fiscal 2020.\nRefundable Tank and Cylinder Deposits\nIncluded in Other noncurrent liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets are customer paid deposits on tanks and cylinders primarily owned by subsidiaries of UGI France of $243 and $296 at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Deposits are refundable to customers when the tanks or cylinders are returned in accordance with contract terms.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations intended to mitigate or remove the effects of past operations and improve or maintain the quality of the environment. These laws and regulations require the removal or remedy of the effect on the environment of the disposal or release of certain specified hazardous substances at current or former operating sites.\nEnvironmental reserves are accrued when assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Amounts recorded as environmental liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represent our best estimate of costs expected to be incurred or, if no best estimate can be made, the minimum liability associated with a range of expected environmental investigation and remediation costs. These estimates are based upon a number of factors including whether the Company will be responsible for such remediation, the scope and cost of the remediation work to be performed, the portion of costs that will be shared with other potentially responsible parties, the timing of the remediation and possible impact of changes in technology, and the regulations and requirements of local governmental authorities. Our estimated liability for environmental contamination is reduced to reflect anticipated participation of other responsible parties but is not reduced for possible recovery from insurance carriers. Under GAAP, if the amount and timing of cash payments associated with environmental investigation and cleanup are reliably determinable, such liabilities are discounted to reflect the time value of money. We intend to pursue recovery of incurred costs through all appropriate means, including regulatory relief. PA Gas Utility receives ratemaking recognition of environmental investigation and remediation costs associated with in-state environmental sites. This ratemaking recognition balances the accumulated difference between historical costs and rate recoveries with an estimate of future costs associated with the sites. For further information, see Note 17.\nLoss Contingencies Subject to Insurance\nWe are subject to risk of loss for general, automobile and product liability, and workers compensation claims for which we obtain insurance coverage under insurance policies that are subject to self-insured retentions or deductibles. In accordance with GAAP, we record accruals when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount or range of amounts can be reasonably estimated. When no amount within a range of possible loss is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, liabilities recorded are based upon the low end of the range. For litigation and pending claims including those covered by insurance policies, the analysis of probable loss is performed on a case by case basis and includes an evaluation of the nature of the claim, the procedural status of the matter, the probability or likelihood of success in prosecuting or defending the claim, the information available with respect to the claim, the opinions and views of outside counsel and other advisors, and past experience in similar matters. With respect to unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents, we may use the work of specialists to estimate the ultimate losses to be incurred using actuarially determined loss development factors applied to actual claims data. Our estimated reserves for loss contingencies may differ materially from the ultimate liability and such reserves may change materially as more information becomes available and estimated reserves are adjusted. We maintain insurance coverage such that our net exposure for claims covered by insurance would be limited to the self-insured retentions or deductibles, claims above which would be paid by the insurance carrier. For such claims, we record a receivable related to the amount of the liability expected to be paid by insurance.\nEmployee Retirement Plans\nWe use a market-related value of plan assets and an expected long-term rate of return to determine the expected return on assets of our U.S. pension and other postretirement plans. The market-related value of plan assets, other than equity investments, is based upon fair values. The market-related value of equity investments is calculated by rolling forward the prior-years market-related value with contributions, disbursements and the expected return on plan assets. One third of the difference between the expected and the actual value is then added to or subtracted from the expected value to determine the new market-related value (see Note 8).\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nNote 3 - Accounting Changes\nNew Accounting Standard Adopted in Fiscal 2022\nIncome Taxes. Effective October 1, 2021, the Company adopted ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes prospectively and retrospectively where deemed applicable. This ASU simplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions within the existing guidance for recognizing deferred taxes for equity method investments, performing intraperiod allocations and calculating income taxes in interim periods. Further, this ASU clarifies existing guidance related to, among other things, recognizing deferred taxes for goodwill and allocated taxes to members of a consolidated group. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNew Accounting Standard Adopted Effective October 1, 2022\nDebt and Derivatives and Hedging. Effective October 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), using the modified retrospective approach. The amendments in this ASU affect entities that issue convertible instruments and/or contracts indexed to and potentially settled in an entitys own equity. This ASU reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock, expands disclosure requirements for convertible instruments, and simplifies the related earnings per share guidance. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNote 4 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nThe Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company generally has the right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer for performance completed to date. As such, we have elected to recognize revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice except in the case of certain of Utilities large delivery service customers and Midstream & Marketings peaking contracts for which we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, consistent with when the performance obligations are satisfied by the Company.\nWe do not have a significant financing component in our contracts because we receive payment shortly before, at, or shortly after the transfer of control of the good or service. Because the period between the time the performance obligation is satisfied and payment is received is generally one year or less, the Company has elected to apply the significant financing component practical expedient and no amount of consideration has been allocated as a financing component.\nThe Companys revenues from contracts with customers are discussed below.\nUtility Revenues\nUtilities supplies natural gas and electricity and provides distribution services of natural gas and electricity to residential, commercial, and industrial customers who are generally billed at standard regulated tariff rates approved by the regulatory bodies through the ratemaking process. Tariff rates include a component that provides for a reasonable opportunity to recover operating costs and expenses and to earn a return on net investment, and a component that provides for the recovery, subject to reasonableness reviews, of PGC, PGA and DS costs.\nCustomers may choose to purchase their natural gas and electricity from Utilities, or, alternatively, may contract separately with alternate suppliers. Accordingly, our contracts with customers comprise two promised goods or services: (1) delivery service of natural gas and electricity through the Companys utility distribution systems and (2) the natural gas or electricity commodity itself for those customers who choose to purchase the natural gas or electricity directly from the Company. Revenue is not recorded for the sale of natural gas or electricity to customers who have contracted separately with alternate suppliers. For those customers who choose to purchase their natural gas or electricity from the Company, the performance obligation includes both the supply of the commodity and the delivery service.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nThe terms of our core market customer contracts are generally considered day-to-day as customers can discontinue service at any time without penalty. Performance obligations are generally satisfied over time as the natural gas or electricity is delivered to customers, at which point the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the delivery service and, when applicable, the commodity. Amounts are billed to customers based upon the reading of a customers meter, which occurs on a cycle basis throughout each reporting period. An unbilled amount is recorded at the end of each reporting period based upon estimated amounts of natural gas or electricity delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading. These unbilled estimates consider various factors such as historical customer usage patterns, customer rates and weather.\nUtilities has certain fixed-term contracts with large commercial and industrial customers to provide natural gas delivery services at contracted rates and at volumes generally based on the customers needs. The performance obligation to provide the contracted delivery service for these large commercial and industrial customers is satisfied over time and revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis.\nUtilities makes off-system sales whereby natural gas delivered to our system in excess of amounts needed to fulfill our distribution system needs is sold to other customers, primarily other distributors of natural gas, based on an agreed-upon price and volume between the Company and the counterparty. Utilities also sells excess natural gas capacity whereby interstate pipeline capacity in excess of amounts needed to meet our customer obligations is sold to other distributors of natural gas based upon an agreed-upon rate. Off-system sales and capacity releases are generally entered into one month at a time and comprise the sale of a specific volume of gas or pipeline capacity at a specific delivery point or points over a specific time. As such, performance obligations associated with off-system sales and capacity release customers are satisfied, and associated revenue is recorded, when the agreed upon volume of natural gas is delivered or capacity is provided, and title is transferred, in accordance with the contract terms.\nElectric Utility provides transmission services to PJM by allowing PJM to access Electric Utilitys electricity transmission facilities. In exchange for providing access, PJM pays Electric Utility consideration determined by a formula-based rate approved by the FERC. The formula-based rate, which is updated annually, allows recovery of costs incurred to provide transmission services and return on transmission-related net investment. We recognize revenue over time as we provide transmission service.\nOther Utility revenues represent revenues from other ancillary services provided to customers and are generally recorded as the service is provided to customers.\nNon-Utility Revenues\nLPG. AmeriGas Propane and UGI International record revenue principally from the sale of LPG to retail and wholesale customers. The primary performance obligation associated with the sale of LPG is the delivery of LPG to (1) the customers point of delivery for retail customers and (2) the customers specified location where LPG is picked up by wholesale customers, at which point control of the LPG is transferred to the customer, the performance obligation is satisfied, and the associated revenue is recognized. For contracts with retail customers that consume LPG from a metered tank, we recognize revenue as LPG is consumed, at which point we have the right to invoice, and generally invoice monthly based on consumption.\nContracts with customers comprise different types of contracts with varying length terms, fixed or variable prices, and fixed or variable quantities. Contracts with our residential customers, which comprise a substantial number of our customer contracts, are generally one year or less. Customer contracts for the sale of LPG include fixed-price, fixed-quantity contracts under which LPG is provided to customers at a fixed price and a fixed volume, and contracts that provide for the sale of LPG at market prices at date of delivery with no fixed volumes. AmeriGas Propane offers contracts that permit customers to lock in a fixed price for their volumes for a fee and also provide customers with the option to pre-buy a fixed amount of LPG at a fixed price. Amounts received under pre-buy arrangements are recorded as a contract liability when received and recorded as revenue when LPG is delivered and control is transferred to the customer. Fee revenue associated with fixed-price contracts are recorded as contract liabilities and recorded ratably over the contract period.\nAmeriGas Propane and UGI International also distribute LPG to customers in portable cylinders. Under certain contracts, filled cylinders are delivered, and control is transferred, to a reseller. In such instances, the reseller is our customer and we record revenue upon delivery to the reseller. Under other contracts, filled cylinders are delivered to a reseller, but the Company retains control of the cylinders. In such instances, we record revenue at the time the reseller transfers control of the cylinder to the end user.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nCertain retail LPG customers for AmeriGas Propane receive credits which we account for as variable consideration. We estimate these credits based upon past practices and historical customer experience and we reduce our revenues recognized for these credits.\nEnergy Marketing. Midstream & Marketing and UGI International operate energy marketing businesses that sell energy commodities, principally natural gas and electricity, to residential, commercial, industrial and wholesale customers.\nMidstream & Marketing and UGI International market natural gas and electricity on full-requirements or agreed-upon volume bases under contracts with varying length terms and at fixed or floating prices that are based on market indices adjusted for differences in price between the market location and delivery locations. Performance obligations associated with these contracts primarily comprise the delivery of the natural gas and electricity over a contractual period of time. Performance obligations also include other energy-related ancillary services provided to customers such as capacity. For performance obligations that are satisfied at a point in time such as the delivery of natural gas, revenue is recorded when customers take control of the natural gas. Revenue is recorded for performance obligations that qualify as a series, when customers consume the natural gas or electricity is delivered, which corresponds to the amount invoiced to the customer. For transactions where the price or volume is not fixed, the transaction price is not determined until delivery occurs. The billed amount, and the revenue recorded, is based upon consumption by the customer.\nMidstream. Midstream & Marketing provides natural gas pipeline transportation, natural gas gathering, natural gas processing and natural gas underground storage services, which generally contain a performance obligation for the Company to have availability to transport or store a product. Additionally, the Company provides stand-ready services to sell supplemental energy products and related services, primarily LNG and propane-air mixtures during periods of high demand that typically result from cold weather. The Company also sells LNG to end-user customers for use by trucks, drilling rigs and other motored vehicles and equipment, and facilities that are located off the natural gas grid.\nContracts for natural gas transportation and gathering services are typically long-term contracts with terms of up to 30 years, while contracts for storage are typically for one-year or multiple storage season periods. Contracts to provide natural gas during periods of high demand have terms of up to 15 years. Contracts to sell LNG for trucks, drilling rigs and other motor vehicles and facilities are typically short-term (less than one year). Depending on the type of services provided or goods sold, midstream revenues may consist of demand rates, commodity rates, and transportation rates and may include other fees for ancillary services. Pipeline transportation, natural gas gathering and storage services provided and services to stand ready to sell supplemental energy products and services each are considered to have a single performance obligation satisfied through the passage of time ratably based upon providing a stand-ready service generally on a monthly basis. Contracts to sell LNG to end-user customers contain performance obligations to deliver LNG over the term of the contract and revenue is recognized at a point in time when the control of the energy products is transferred to the customer. The price in the contract corresponds to our efforts to satisfy the performance obligation and reflects the consideration we expect to receive for the satisfied performance obligation, and, therefore, the revenue is recognized based on the volume delivered and the price within the contract. In cases where shipping and handling occurs prior to the LNG being delivered to the customers storage vessel, we have elected to treat this as a cost of fulfillment and not a separate performance obligation. Revenues are typically billed and payment received monthly. Advance fees received from customers for stand-ready services are deferred as contract liabilities and revenue is recognized ratably over time as the performance obligation is satisfied over a period less than one year.\nElectricity Generation. Midstream & Marketing sells power generated from electricity generation assets in the wholesale electricity markets administered by PJM regional transmission organization. Power contracts with PJM consist of the sale of power, capacity and ancillary services, all of which are considered a bundle of various services. Performance obligations are satisfied over time, generally on a daily basis, as electricity is delivered to and simultaneously consumed by the customer. As such, the Company has elected to recognize revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice which is based on market prices at the time of the delivery of the electricity to the customers.\nOther. Other revenues from contracts with customers are generated primarily from services and products provided by Midstream & Marketings HVAC business, prior to its sale in September 2020, and AmeriGas Propanes parts and services business. The performance obligations of these businesses include installation, repair and warranty agreements associated with HVAC equipment and installation services provided for combined heat and power and solar panel installations. For installation and repair goods and services, the performance obligations under these contracts are satisfied, and revenue is recognized, as control of the product is transferred or the services are rendered. For warranty services, revenue is recorded ratably over the warranty period. Other LPG revenues from contracts with customers are generated primarily from certain fees AmeriGas Propane and UGI International charge associated with the delivery of LPG, including hazmat safety compliance, inspection,\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nmetering, installation, fuel recovery and certain other services. Revenues from fees are typically recorded when the LPG is delivered to the customer or the associated service is completed.\nRevenue Disaggregation\nThe following tables present our disaggregated revenues by reportable segment during Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020:\n2022 Total Eliminations\n(a) AmeriGas Propane UGI International Midstream & Marketing Utilities Corporate & Other\nRevenues from contracts with customers:\nUtility:\nCore Market:\nResidential $ 875 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 875 $ -\nCommercial & Industrial 365 - - - - 365 -\nLarge delivery service 171 - - - - 171 -\nOff-system sales and capacity releases 76 (104) - - - 180 -\nOther 23 (1) - - - 24 -\nTotal Utility 1,510 (105) - - - 1,615 -\nNon-Utility:\nLPG:\nRetail 4,436 - 2,439 1,997 - - -\nWholesale 496 - 218 278 - - -\nEnergy Marketing 2,951 (264) - 1,298 1,917 - -\nMidstream:\nPipeline 211 - - - 211 - -\nPeaking 48 (105) - - 153 - -\nOther 9 - - - 9 - -\nElectricity Generation 34 - - - 34 - -\nOther 286 - 207 79 - - -\nTotal Non-Utility 8,471 (369) 2,864 3,652 2,324 - -\nTotal revenues from contracts with customers 9,981 (474) 2,864 3,652 2,324 1,615 -\nOther revenues (b) 125 (3) 79 34 2 5 8\nTotal revenues $ 10,106 $ (477) $ 2,943 $ 3,686 $ 2,326 $ 1,620 $ 8\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\n2021 Total Eliminations\n(a) AmeriGas Propane UGI International Midstream & Marketing Utilities Corporate & Other\nRevenues from contracts with customers:\nUtility:\nCore Market:\nResidential $ 568 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 568 $ -\nCommercial & Industrial 218 - - - - 218 -\nLarge delivery service 148 - - - - 148 -\nOff-system sales and capacity releases 51 (62) - - - 113 -\nOther 21 (2) - - - 23 -\nTotal Utility 1,006 (64) - - - 1,070 -\nNon-Utility:\nLPG:\nRetail 3,957 - 2,203 1,754 - - -\nWholesale 328 - 139 189 - - -\nEnergy Marketing 1,564 (126) - 605 1,085 - -\nMidstream:\nPipeline 181 - - - 181 - -\nPeaking 16 (98) - - 114 - -\nOther 8 - - - 8 - -\nElectricity Generation 13 - - - 13 - -\nOther 275 - 206 69 - - -\nTotal Non-Utility 6,342 (224) 2,548 2,617 1,401 - -\nTotal revenues from contracts with customers 7,348 (288) 2,548 2,617 1,401 1,070 -\nOther revenues (b) 99 (3) 66 34 5 9 (12)\nTotal revenues $ 7,447 $ (291) $ 2,614 $ 2,651 $ 1,406 $ 1,079 $ (12)\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\n2020 Total Eliminations\n(a) AmeriGas Propane UGI International Midstream & Marketing Utilities Corporate & Other\nRevenues from contracts with customers:\nUtility:\nCore Market:\nResidential $ 563 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 563 $ -\nCommercial & Industrial 215 - - - - 215 -\nLarge delivery service 142 - - - - 142 -\nOff-system sales and capacity releases 48 (45) - - - 93 -\nOther 14 (2) - - - 16 -\nTotal Utility 982 (47) - - - 1,029 -\nNon-Utility:\nLPG:\nRetail 3,499 - 2,037 1,462 - - -\nWholesale 211 - 63 148 - - -\nEnergy Marketing 1,233 (79) - 434 878 - -\nMidstream:\nPipeline 168 - - - 168 - -\nPeaking 6 (100) - - 106 - -\nOther 7 - - - 7 - -\nElectricity Generation 34 - - - 34 - -\nOther 312 (3) 215 60 40 - -\nTotal Non-Utility 5,470 (182) 2,315 2,104 1,233 - -\nTotal revenues from contracts with customers 6,452 (229) 2,315 2,104 1,233 1,029 -\nOther revenues (b) 107 (3) 66 23 14 1 6\nTotal revenues $ 6,559 $ (232) $ 2,381 $ 2,127 $ 1,247 $ 1,030 $ 6\n(a)Includes intersegment revenues principally among Midstream & Marketing, Utilities and AmeriGas Propane.\n(b)Primarily represents revenues from tank rentals at AmeriGas Propane and UGI International, rental revenues from certain assets at Midstream & Marketing, revenues from alternative revenue programs at Utilities, and gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments not associated with current-period transactions reflected in Corporate & Other, none of which are within the scope of ASC 606 and are accounted for in accordance with other GAAP.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers or cash receipts. Contract assets represent our right to consideration after the performance obligations have been satisfied when such right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. Contract assets were not material at September 30, 2022 and 2021. Substantially all of our receivables are unconditional rights to consideration and are included in Accounts receivable and, in the case of Utilities, Accrued utility revenues on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts billed are generally due within the following month.\nContract liabilities arise when payment from a customer is received before the performance obligations have been satisfied and represent the Companys obligations to transfer goods or services to a customer for which we have received consideration. The balances of contract liabilities were $164 and $149 at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are primarily included in Deposits and Advances on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Revenues recognized during Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 from the amount included in contract liabilities at September 30, 2021, September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019 was $119, $138 and $122, respectively.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe Company excludes disclosures related to the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to certain performance obligations that are unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period because these contracts have an initial expected term of one year or less, or we have a right to bill the customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of services provided to the customer to date. Certain contracts with customers at Midstream & Marketing and Utilities contain minimum future performance obligations through 2047 and 2053, respectively. At September 30, 2022, Midstream & Marketing and Utilities expect to record approximately $2.4 billion and $0.2 billion of revenues, respectively, related to the minimum future performance obligations over the remaining terms of the related contracts.\nNote 5 - Acquisitions and Dispositions\nMountaineer Acquisition\nOn September 1, 2021, UGI completed the Mountaineer Acquisition in which UGI acquired all of the equity interests in Mountaineer, the largest natural gas distribution company in West Virginia, for a purchase price of $540, including the assumption of $140 principal amounts of long-term debt. The Mountaineer Acquisition was consummated pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement between UGI and the iCON Sellers and is consistent with our growth strategies, including expanding our core utility operations in the mid-Atlantic region. The Mountaineer Acquisition was funded with cash proceeds from the 2021 UGI Corporation Senior Credit Facility $215 term loan and cash on hand including proceeds from the issuance of Equity Units. Accounts associated with Mountaineer are included within our Utilities reportable segment.\nThe Company has accounted for the Mountaineer Acquisition using the acquisition method. During Fiscal 2022, the Company recorded an adjustment to decrease goodwill by $5 primarily reflecting an adjustment to a valuation allowance on certain deferred income taxes. The Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2022, reflects the final allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Mountaineer Acquisition.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nThe components of the Mountaineer purchase price allocations are as follows:\nAssets acquired:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 3\nAccounts receivable 14\nInventories 41\nOther current assets 21\nProperty, plant and equipment 397\nOther noncurrent assets 48\nTotal assets acquired $ 524\nLiabilities assumed:\nShort-term borrowings $ 55\nAccounts payable 20\nOther current liabilities 52\nLong-term debt 164\nPension and other postretirement benefit obligation 33\nDeferred income taxes 21\nOther noncurrent liabilities 29\nTotal liabilities assumed $ 374\nGoodwill 250\nNet consideration transferred $ 400\nMountaineer is a regulated entity which accounts for the financial effects of regulation in accordance with ASC 980. The effects of regulation can impact the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired, and as such, the measurement of the fair value of regulated property assets using the predecessors carrying value is generally accepted since regulation attaches to the assets and regulation is so pervasive that the regulation extends to the individual assets. In certain other instances where assets or liabilities are subject to rate recovery, we recorded fair value adjustments to such assets and liabilities as regulatory assets and liabilities.\nThe excess of the purchase price for the Mountaineer Acquisition over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been reflected as goodwill, assigned to the Utilities reportable segment. Goodwill is attributable to the assembled workforce of Mountaineer, planned customer growth and planned growth in rate base through continued investment in utility infrastructure. The goodwill recognized from the Mountaineer Acquisition is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe Company recognized $13 of direct transaction-related costs associated with the Mountaineer Acquisition during Fiscal 2021, which costs are reflected in Operating and administrative expenses on the 2021 Consolidated Statement of Income. The Mountaineer Acquisition did not have a material impact on the Companys revenues or net income attributable to UGI for Fiscal 2021. In addition, the impact of the Mountaineer Acquisition on a pro forma basis as if the Mountaineer Acquisition had occurred on October 1, 2019 was not material to the Companys revenues or net income for Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020.\nOther Acquisitions\nDuring Fiscal 2021, UGI International acquired several LPG retail businesses and an energy marketing business in Europe. During Fiscal 2020, Energy Services acquired GHI, a Houston, Texas-based renewable natural gas company currently doing business in California.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nTotal cash paid and liabilities incurred in connection with these acquisitions were as follows:\n2021 2020\nUGI International Midstream & Marketing\nTotal cash paid $ 18 $ 16\nLiabilities incurred - 7\nTotal purchase price $ 18 $ 23\nAcquisitions of Assets\nPennant. As of September 30, 2021, Energy Services held a 47% membership interest in Pennant, a natural gas gathering system located in northeast Ohio and western Pennsylvania. During Fiscal 2022, UGI through its wholly owned indirect subsidiary, Energy Services, completed the Pennant Acquisition in which Energy Services acquired the remaining 53% of the equity interests in Pennant for total cash consideration of approximately $61. The Pennant Acquisition was funded using available cash. The acquisition of the remaining interests has been accounted for as an acquisition of assets, and the purchase price has been primarily allocated to property, plant and equipment. See Note 22 for additional information related to the acquired interest in Pennant.\nStonehenge. On January 27, 2022, UGI through its wholly owned indirect subsidiary, Energy Services, completed the Stonehenge Acquisition in which Energy Services acquired all of the equity interests in Stonehenge for total cash consideration of approximately $190. The Stonehenge business includes a natural gas gathering system, located in western Pennsylvania, with more than 47 miles of pipeline and associated compression assets. The Stonehenge Acquisition is consistent with our growth strategies, including expanding our midstream natural gas gathering assets within the Appalachian basin production region. The Stonehenge Acquisition was funded using available cash. This transaction has been accounted for as an acquisition of assets, and the purchase price has been primarily allocated to property, plant and equipment. We refer to Stonehenge and its assets as UGI Moraine East.\nDispositions\nConemaugh. In July 2020, Energy Services, through a wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an agreement to sell its approximate 5.97% ownership interest in Conemaugh. As a result, the Company reduced the carrying amount of these assets to their fair values during the third quarter of Fiscal 2020 and recognized a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $52 which amount is reflected in Loss on disposals of Conemaugh and HVAC on the 2020 Consolidated Statement of Income. The fair value of such assets was based upon the agreed upon sales price, and was determined to be a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The sale was completed on September 30, 2020.\nHVAC. In September 2020, Enterprises entered into an agreement to sell its HVAC business. As a result, the Company reduced the carrying amount of these assets to their fair values during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020 and recognized a non-cash, pre-tax loss on disposal of $2 which amount is reflected in Loss on disposals of Conemaugh and HVAC on the 2020 Consolidated Statement of Income. The fair value of such assets was based upon the agreed upon sales price, and was determined to be a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The sale was completed on September 30, 2020.\nNote 6 - Debt\nSignificant Financing Activities Since September 30, 2021\nMountaineer Credit Agreement. On October 20, 2022, Mountaineer entered into the Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement, as borrower, with a group of lenders. The Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement amends and restates a previous credit agreement and provides for borrowings up to $150, including a $20 sublimit for letters of credit. Mountaineer may request an increase in the amount of loan commitments to a maximum aggregate amount of $250, subject to certain terms and conditions. Borrowings under the Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement can be used to finance the working capital needs of Mountaineer and for general corporate purposes. The Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire in November 2024, with an option to extend the maturity date.\nAmeriGas Propane. On September 28, 2022, AmeriGas Propane entered into the 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement, as borrower, with a group of lenders. In connection with the entering into of the 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement, the\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nborrower paid off in full and terminated the existing AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement. The 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement provides for borrowings up to $600, including a $100 sublimit for letters of credit. AmeriGas Propane may request an increase in the amount of loan commitments under the 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement to a maximum aggregate amount of $900, subject to certain terms and conditions. Borrowings under the 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement can be used to fund acquisitions and investments and for general corporate purposes. The 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire in September 2026.\nUGI Utilities. On July 12, 2022, UGI Utilities amended the Utilities Term Loan. The amendment extended the maturity date of the loan from October 2022 to July 2027, among other things. The current amount outstanding under the Utilities Term Loan remains unchanged and is payable in quarterly installments of $2, with the balance of the principal being due and payable in full at maturity. We have entered into an interest rate swap that will generally fix the underlying market-based interest rate on this variable-rate loan through June 2026.\nOn June 30, 2022, UGI Utilities entered into a note purchase agreement which provides for the private placement of (1) $90 aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Senior Notes due July 15, 2032 and (2) $85 aggregate principal amount of 4.99% Senior Notes due September 15, 2052. On July 15, 2022, UGI Utilities issued $90 aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Senior Notes pursuant to the note purchase agreement. On September 15, 2022, UGI Utilities issued $85 aggregate principal amount of 4.99% Senior Notes pursuant to the note purchase agreement. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 4.75% Senior Notes and 4.99% Senior Notes were used to reduce short-term borrowings and for general corporate purposes.\nMountaineer. On June 30, 2022, Mountaineer entered into a note purchase agreement which provides for the private placement of $40 aggregate principal amount of 4.49% Senior Notes due August 16, 2052. On August 16, 2022, Mountaineer issued $40 aggregate principal amount of 4.49% Senior Notes pursuant to the note purchase agreement. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 4.49% Senior Notes were used to reduce short-term borrowings and for general corporate purposes.\nUGI International. On December 7, 2021, UGI International, LLC issued, in an underwritten private placement, \u20ac400 principal amount of the UGI International 2.50% Senior Notes due December 1, 2029. The UGI International 2.50% Senior Notes rank equal in right of payment with indebtedness issued under the UGI International Credit Facilities Agreement.\nThe net proceeds from the UGI International 2.50% Senior Notes were used (1) to repay all of the UGI International 3.25% Senior Notes due November 1, 2025 and associated fees and expenses and (2) for general corporate purposes. We have designated the UGI International 2.50% Senior Notes as a net investment hedge. In connection with this early repayment of debt, UGI International recognized a pre-tax loss of $11, which is reflected in Loss on extinguishment of debt on the Consolidated Statements of Income, and primarily comprises the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and early redemption premiums.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nCredit Facilities and Short-term Borrowings\nInformation about the Companys principal credit agreements (excluding the Energy Services Receivables Facility, which is discussed below) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, is presented in the following table.

The 2021 UGI Corporation Senior Credit Facility includes a $10 sublimit for letters of credit.\nN.A. - Not applicable\nN.M. - Not meaningful\nEnergy Services Receivables Facility. Energy Services has a Receivables Facility with an issuer of receivables-backed commercial paper. On October 21, 2022, the expiration date of the Receivables Facility was extended to October 20, 2023. The Receivables Facility provides Energy Services with the ability to borrow up to $150 of eligible receivables during the period October 21, 2022 to April 30, 2023, and up to $75 of eligible receivables during the period May 1, 2023 to October 20, 2023. Energy Services uses the Receivables Facility to fund working capital, margin calls under commodity futures contracts, capital expenditures, dividends and for general corporate purposes.\nUnder the Receivables Facility, Energy Services transfers, on an ongoing basis and without recourse, its trade accounts receivable to its wholly owned, special purpose subsidiary, ESFC, which is consolidated for financial statement purposes. ESFC, in turn, has sold and, subject to certain conditions, may from time to time sell, an undivided interest in some or all of the\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nreceivables to a major bank. Amounts sold to the bank are reflected as Short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. ESFC was created and has been structured to isolate its assets from creditors of Energy Services and its affiliates, including UGI. Trade receivables sold to the bank remain on the Companys balance sheet and the Company reflects a liability equal to the amount advanced by the bank. The Company records interest expense on amounts owed to the bank. Energy Services continues to service, administer and collect trade receivables on behalf of the bank, as applicable.\nInformation regarding the amounts of trade receivables transferred to ESFC and the amounts sold to the bank are as follows:\n2022 2021 2020\nTrade receivables transferred to ESFC during the year $ 2,221 $ 1,353 $ 1,046\nESFC trade receivables sold to the bank during the year $ 152 $ 308 $ 182\nESFC trade receivables - end of year (a) $ 101 $ 61 $ 50\n(a)At September 30, 2022 and 2021, there were no ESFC trade receivables sold to the bank.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nLong-term Debt\nLong-term debt comprises the following at September 30:\n2022 2021\nAmeriGas Propane:\nAmeriGas Partners Senior Notes:\n5.50% due May 2025\n$ 700 $ 700\n5.875% due August 2026\n675 675\n5.625% due May 2024\n675 675\n5.75% due May 2027\n525 525\nOther - 1\nUnamortized debt issuance costs (12) (16)\nTotal AmeriGas Propane 2,563 2,560\nUGI International:\n3.25% Senior Notes due November 2025\n- 405\n2.50% Senior Notes due December 2029\n392 -\nUGI International, LLC variable-rate term loan due October 2023 (a) 294 347\nOther 2 23\nUnamortized debt issuance costs (6) (5)\nTotal UGI International 682 770\nMidstream & Marketing:\nEnergy Services variable-rate term loan due through August 2026 (b) 677 684\nOther 40 42\nUnamortized discount and debt issuance costs (7) (10)\nTotal Energy Services 710 716\nUtilities:\nSenior Notes:\n4.12% due September 2046\n200 200\n4.98% due March 2044\n175 175\n3.12% due April 2050\n150 150\n4.55% due February 2049\n150 150\n4.12% due October 2046\n100 100\n6.21% due September 2036\n100 100\n2.95% due June 2026\n100 100\n1.59% due June 2026\n100 100\n1.64% due September 2026\n75 75\n4.75% due July 2032\n90 -\n4.99% due September 2052\n85 -\nMedium-Term Notes:\n6.13% due October 2034\n20 20\n6.50% due August 2033\n20 20\nMountaineer senior notes (c) 201 164\nVariable-rate term loan due through July 2027 (d) 95 102\nOther 1 1\nUnamortized debt issuance costs (6) (6)\nTotal UGI Utilities 1,656 1,451\nUGI Corporation:\nUGI Corporation revolving credit facility maturing August 2024 (e) 252 185\nUGI Corporation variable-rate term loan due May 2025 (f) 300 300\nUGI Corporation variable-rate term loan due through August 2024 (g) 250 250\nUGI Corporation variable-rate term loan due May 2025 (h) 215 215\nUnamortized debt issuance costs (2) (5)\nTotal UGI Corporation 1,015 945\nOther 6 7\nTotal long-term debt 6,632 6,449\nLess: current maturities (149) (110)\nTotal long-term debt due after one year $ 6,483 $ 6,339\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\n(a)The effective interest rate on the term loan was 1.89% at both September 30, 2022 and 2021.

We have entered into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps to effectively fix the underlying variable rate on a portion of these borrowings.\n(f)At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the effective interest rates on the term loan was 2.67% and 3.26%, respectively. We have entered into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps to effectively fix the underlying variable rate on these borrowings.\n(g)At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the effective interest rates on the term loan were 4.15% and 3.56%, respectively. We have entered into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps to effectively fix the underlying variable rate on a portion of these borrowings. Term loan borrowings are due in equal quarterly installments of $9, commencing December 2022, with the balance of the principal being due in full at maturity.\n(h)At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the effective interest rates on the term loan were 3.53% and 1.88%.

Such repayments are classified as Current maturities of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRestrictive Covenants\nOur long-term debt and credit facility agreements generally contain customary covenants and default provisions which may include, among other things, restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and also restrict liens, guarantees, investments, loans and advances, payments, mergers, consolidations, asset transfers, transactions with affiliates, sales of assets, acquisitions and other transactions. These agreements contain standard provisions which require compliance with certain financial ratios. UGI and its subsidiaries were in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2022.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nRestricted Net Assets\nAt September 30, 2022, the amount of net assets of UGIs consolidated subsidiaries that were restricted from transfer to UGI under debt agreements, subsidiary partnership agreements and regulatory requirements under foreign laws totaled approximately $2,900.\nNote 7 - Income Taxes\nIncome before income taxes comprises the following:\n2022 2021 2020\nDomestic $ 362 $ 647 $ 424\nForeign 1,025 1,342 243\nTotal income before income taxes $ 1,387 $ 1,989 $ 667\nThe provisions for income taxes consist of the following:\n2022 2021 2020\nCurrent expense (benefit):\nFederal $ 24 $ (48) $ (85)\nState 18 7 4\nForeign 50 85 70\nTotal current expense (benefit) 92 44 (11)\nDeferred expense (benefit):\nFederal 45 168 135\nState (17) 48 19\nForeign 193 262 (8)\nTotal deferred expense 221 478 146\nTotal income tax expense $ 313 $ 522 $ 135\nFederal income taxes for Fiscal 2022 are net of foreign tax credits of $5. There were none utilized in Fiscal 2021 or Fiscal 2020.\nA reconciliation from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to our effective tax rate is as follows:\n2022 2021 2020\nU.S. federal statutory tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nDifference in tax rate due to:\nEffects of U.S. tax legislation - (0.8) (4.7)\nEffects of tax rate changes - International (2.3) (1.3) 0.3\nEffects of tax rate changes - State, net of federal benefit (1.4) - -\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit 1.5 1.9 2.8\nValuation allowance adjustments (0.5) 1.0 -\nEffects of foreign operations 4.4 4.6 1.3\nExcess tax benefits on share-based payments (0.3) (0.1) (0.2)\nOther, net 0.2 (0.1) (0.3)\nEffective tax rate 22.6 % 26.2 % 20.2 %\nIn July 2022, tax legislation was enacted in Pennsylvania reducing the states corporate net income tax rate from 9.99% to 4.99% over a nine-year period, beginning with an initial reduction to 8.99% beginning in Fiscal 2024. The legislation resulted in a $20 benefit being recorded in Fiscal 2022 based on the Companys analysis of future reversals of net deferred tax liabilities.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nIn February 2021, tax legislation was enacted in Italy which allowed the Company to align book basis with tax basis on certain assets in exchange for paying a three percent substitute tax payment payable in three annual installments. This election resulted in a $23 net benefit in Fiscal 2021. Timing of the recovery of the resulting incremental tax basis was changed with legislation in Fiscal 2022 extending the deductible period of recovery from 18 to 50 years.\nOn March 27, 2020 the CARES Act was enacted into law. The primary impact of the legislation was the change in federal net operating loss carryback rules which allowed the Companys U.S. federal tax losses generated in Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 to be carried back to Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015. The carryback of our Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 U.S. federal tax losses from a 21% rate environment to offset taxable income in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 in a 35% rate environment generated incremental benefits of $15 and $32, respectively. A $90 refund claim for the Fiscal 2020 carryback to Fiscal 2015 was filed and has been approved by the IRS, though the actual cash refund was not received in Fiscal 2022. Of the outstanding $90 refund, $75 was received subsequent to Fiscal 2022. A $37 refund claim for the Fiscal 2021 claim has been filed. Both are included in Income taxes receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2022 and 2021. On July 20, 2020, the Treasury Department issued final regulations under IRC Section 951A permitting a taxpayer to elect to exclude, from its inclusion of GILTI, income subject to a high effective rate of foreign tax. The impact of these final regulations reduced U.S. tax of foreign source income in Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020.\nOur effective tax rate is subject to the impact of changes to the taxation of foreign source income made by the TCJA and the high tax exception regulations issued in July 2020. Income tax expense for Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 includes $3, $8 and $0, respectively, of GILTI taxes that are treated as current period costs and carry no related deferred taxes.\nPennsylvania and West Virginia utility ratemaking practices permit the flow through to ratepayers of state tax benefits resulting from accelerated tax depreciation. For Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, the beneficial effects of state tax flow through of accelerated depreciation reduced income tax expense by $10, $9, and $11, respectively.\nDeferred tax liabilities (assets) comprise the following at September 30:\n2022 2021\nExcess book basis over tax basis of property, plant and equipment $ 867 $ 937\nUtility regulatory assets 106 105\nIntangible assets and goodwill 75 77\nDerivative instrument assets 514 322\nOther 33 36\nGross deferred tax liabilities 1,595 1,477\nInvestment in AmeriGas Partners (79) (102)\nPension plan liabilities (21) (29)\nEmployee-related benefits (38) (45)\nOperating loss carryforwards (48) (53)\nForeign tax credit carryforwards (76) (79)\nUtility regulatory liabilities (85) (102)\nUtility environmental liabilities (15) (16)\nOther (125) (107)\nGross deferred tax assets (487) (533)\nDeferred tax assets valuation allowance 141 138\nNet deferred tax liabilities $ 1,249 $ 1,082\nAt September 30, 2022, we carried foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $5 relating to Flaga, $30 at certain subsidiaries of UGI France, and $10 in the Netherlands with no expiration dates. We have state net operating loss carryforwards primarily relating to certain subsidiaries that approximate $787 and expire through 2042. We also have federal operating loss carryforwards of $16 for Mountaintop Energy Holdings, LLC and $6 for certain operations of AmeriGas Propane. At\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nSeptember 30, 2022, deferred tax assets relating to operating loss carryforwards amounted to $48 related to various UGI subsidiaries.\nValuation allowances against deferred tax assets exist for foreign tax credit carryforwards, net operating loss carryforwards of foreign subsidiaries, capital loss carryforwards and a notional interest deduction. The valuation allowance for all deferred tax assets increased by $3 in Fiscal 2022, which included a $17 increase in a notional interest deduction carryover, a $4 decrease from state tax rate changes, offset by a release of $6 against FTCs, that will be realizable in the future and a $4 decrease related to foreign net operating loss carry forwards.\nThe valuation allowance for all deferred tax assets increased by $33 in Fiscal 2021, which included a $30 increase related to future capital losses from the PennEast and Hudson investments, and a $10 increase in a notional interest deduction carryover, partially offset by the release of $10 against FTCs.\nWe conduct business and file tax returns in the U.S., numerous states, local jurisdictions and in France and certain other European countries. Our U.S. federal income tax returns are settled through the 2018 tax year, our French tax returns are settled through the 2018 tax year, our Austrian tax returns are settled through 2017 and our other European tax returns are effectively settled for various years from 2014 to 2019. State and other income tax returns in the U.S. are generally subject to examination for a period of three to five years after the filing of the respective returns.\nThe Companys unrecognized tax benefits including amounts related to accrued interest, which if subsequently recognized would be recorded as a benefit to income taxes, amounted to $4, $4, and $4 at September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Activity related to these unrecognized tax benefits was not material for all periods presented.\nNote 8 - Employee Retirement Plans\nDefined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans\nThe U.S. Pension Plans consist of (1) a defined benefit pension plan for employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, of UGI, UGI Utilities, and certain of UGIs other domestic wholly owned subsidiaries and (2) a defined benefit pension plan for substantially all Mountaineer employees. U.S. Pension Plans benefits are based on years of service, age and employee compensation. In addition, certain UGI International employees in France and Belgium are covered by defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. Although the disclosures in the tables below include amounts related to the UGI International plans, such amounts are not material.\nWe also provide postretirement health care benefits to certain retirees and postretirement life insurance benefits to certain U.S. active and retired employees. The ABO of our other postretirement benefit plans was $22 and $31 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fair value of the plan assets of our other postretirement benefit plans was $16 and $19 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the PBOs of our pension plans (the U.S. Pension Plans and the UGI International pension plans), plan assets, and the related funded status of our pension plans as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. ABO is the present value of benefits earned to date with benefits based upon current compensation levels. PBO is ABO increased to reflect estimated future compensation.\nPension Benefits\n2022 2021\nChange in benefit obligations:\nBenefit obligations - beginning of year $ 870 $ 782\nService cost 16 12\nInterest cost 26 22\nActuarial gain (240) (30)\nPlan amendments 1 2\nAcquisitions - 114\nForeign currency (6) (1)\nBenefits paid (34) (31)\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nPension Benefits\n2022 2021\nBenefit obligations - end of year (a) $ 633 $ 870\nChange in plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets - beginning of year $ 736 $ 585\nActual (loss) gain on plan assets (173) 75\nForeign currency (3) -\nEmployer contributions 15 14\nAcquisitions - 92\nBenefits paid (34) (30)\nFair value of plan assets - end of year $ 541 $ 736\nFunded status of the plans - end of year (b) $ (92) $ (134)\nAmounts recorded in UGI Corporation stockholders equity (pre-tax):\nPrior service cost $ 3 $ 3\nNet actuarial (gain) loss (17) 13\nTotal $ (14) $ 16\nAmounts recorded in regulatory assets and liabilities (pre-tax):\nNet actuarial loss 114 108\nTotal $ 114 $ 108\n(a) The ABO for the U.S. Pension Plans was $570 and $756 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(b) Amounts are reflected in Other noncurrent liabilities and Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts reflected in Other assets are not material.\nIn Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, the change in the pension plans PBO due to actuarial gains and losses is principally the result of changes in discount rates.\nActuarial assumptions for our U.S. Pension Plans are described below. The discount rate assumption was determined by selecting a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments of the plans. The discount rate was then developed as the single rate that equates the market value of the bonds purchased to the discounted value of the plans benefit payments. The expected rate of return on assets assumption is based on current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets (as further described below).\nPension Plans\n2022 2021 2020\nWeighted-average assumptions:\nDiscount rate - benefit obligations 5.70 % 3.13 % 2.90 %\nDiscount rate - benefit cost\n3.13 % 2.90 % 3.30 %\nExpected return on plan assets\n7.10 % 7.10 % 7.20 %\nRate of increase in salary levels\n3.25 % 3.25 % 3.25 %\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nThe service cost component of our pension and other postretirement plans, net of amounts capitalized, is reflected in Operating and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The non-service cost components, net of amounts capitalized by Utilities as a regulatory asset, are reflected in Other non-operating income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Other postretirement benefit cost was not material for all periods presented. Net periodic pension cost includes the following components:\nPension Benefits\n2022 2021 2020\nService cost $ 16 $ 12 $ 11\nInterest cost 26 22 23\nExpected return on assets (50) (40) (38)\nCurtailment gain - - (1)\nAmortization of:\nPrior service cost - - 1\nActuarial loss 7 14 15\nNet benefit (income) cost $ (1) $ 8 $ 11\nIt is our general policy to fund amounts for U.S. Pension Plans benefits equal to at least the minimum required contribution set forth in applicable employee benefit laws. From time to time, we may, at our discretion, contribute additional amounts. During Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, we made cash contributions to the U.S. Pension Plans of $14, $13 and $13, respectively. The minimum required contributions in Fiscal 2023 are not expected to be material.\nUGI Utilities has established a VEBA trust to pay certain retiree health care and life insurance benefits by depositing into the VEBA the annual amount of postretirement benefits costs, if any. Assets associated with the VEBA are not material and we do not expect to be required to make any contributions to the VEBA during Fiscal 2023.\nExpected payments for postretirement benefits over the next 10 years are not material. Expected payments for pension benefits are as follows:\nPension\nBenefits\nFiscal 2023 $ 37\nFiscal 2024 $ 38\nFiscal 2025 $ 40\nFiscal 2026 $ 41\nFiscal 2027 $ 43\nFiscal 2028 - 2032 $ 229\nWe also sponsor unfunded and non-qualified supplemental executive defined benefit retirement plans. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the PBOs of these plans, including obligations for amounts held in grantor trusts, totaled $44 and $57, respectively. Costs associated with these plans were not material for all periods presented and are excluded from the tables above. Amounts recorded in UGIs stockholders equity for these plans include pre-tax losses of $1 and $10 at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, principally representing unrecognized actuarial losses. In Fiscal 2023, the estimated amount that will be amortized from such pre-tax actuarial losses into retiree benefit cost is not material. During Fiscal 2021, the Company made $12 of payments for the supplemental executive defined benefit retirement plans. During Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2020, the payments the Company made with respect to the supplemental executive defined benefit retirement plans were not material. The total fair value of the grantor trust investment assets associated with the supplemental executive defined benefit retirement plans, which are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaled $31 and $44 at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nU.S. Pension Plans Assets\nThe assets of the U.S. Pension Plans are held in trust. The investment policies and asset allocation strategies for the assets in these trusts are determined by the Retirement Plan Committee comprising certain members of UGIs senior management. The overall investment objective is to minimize projected funded status volatility by more closely aligning the duration of the U.S. Pension Plans fixed income portfolio to the duration of its liabilities. The proportion of plan assets allocated to fixed income investments will increase as the funded status increases. Investments are made principally in common collective trust funds that consist of equity index investments, bond index investments and short-term investments, and, to a much less extent, UGI Common Stock.\nThe targets and actual allocations for the U.S. Pension Plans trust assets at September 30 are as follows:\nActual Target Asset Allocation (b)\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nEquity investments:\nU.S. equities 26.5 % 22.2 % 24.7 % 25.3 %\nNon-U.S. equities 20.9 % 21.7 % 20.9 % 21.4 %\nGlobal equities (a) 13.8 % 16.0 % 13.1 % 13.1 %\nTotal 61.2 % 59.9 % 58.7 % 59.8 %\nFixed income funds & cash equivalents 35.5 % 36.4 % 35.0 % 34.4 %\nAlternative investments 3.3 % 3.7 % 6.3 % 5.8 %\nTotal 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\n(a) Comprises investment funds that consist of a mix of U.S. and Non-U.S. equity securities.\n(b) There is a permitted range for the allocation of the trust assets for the U.S. Pension Plans, excluding the defined benefit pension plan for Mountaineer employees, which is 5% less than and greater than the target allocation.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nCommon collective trust funds in the U.S. Pension Plans primarily include investments in U.S., Non-U.S. and global (a mix of U.S. and Non-U.S.) equities, fixed income and short-term investments. The fair values of common collective trust funds and cash equivalents are valued at the NAV of units of the collective trusts. The NAVs, as provided by the trustee, are used as a practical expedient to estimate fair value based on the fair values of the underlying investments held by the funds less their liabilities. The fair values of the U.S. Pension Plans trust assets by asset class as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\n2022 2021\nU.S. Pension Plans:\nDomestic equity investments:\nUGI Corporation Common Stock $ 26 $ 35\nTotal domestic equity investments (a) 26 35\nCommon collective trust funds:\nU.S. equity index investments 113 124\nNon-U.S. equity index investments 110 155\nGlobal equity index investments 72 115\nBond index investments 177 254\nCash equivalents 10 7\nTotal common collective trust funds (b) 482 655\nAlternative investments (b) 17 27\nTotal $ 525 $ 717\n(a) Level 1 investments within the fair value hierarchy.\n(b) Assets measured at NAV and therefore excluded from the fair value hierarchy.\nThe expected long-term rates of return on U.S. Pension Plans trust assets have been developed using a best estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class. The estimates are based on historical capital market performance data and future expectations provided by independent consultants. Future expectations are determined by using simulations that provide a wide range of scenarios of future market performance. The market conditions in these simulations consider the long-term relationships between equities and fixed income as well as current market conditions at the start of the simulation. The expected rate begins with a risk-free rate of return with other factors being added such as inflation, duration, credit spreads and equity risk premiums. The rates of return derived from this process are applied to our target asset allocation to develop a reasonable return assumption.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe sponsor 401(k) savings plans for eligible employees of UGI and certain of UGIs domestic subsidiaries. Generally, participants in these plans may contribute a portion of their compensation on either a before-tax basis, or on both a before-tax and after-tax basis. These plans also provide for employer matching contributions at various rates. The cost of benefits under the savings plans totaled $21 in Fiscal 2022, $21 in Fiscal 2021 and $21 in Fiscal 2020. The Company also sponsors certain nonqualified supplemental defined contribution executive retirement plans. These plans generally provide supplemental benefits to certain executives that would otherwise be provided under retirement plans but are prohibited due to limitations imposed by the IRC. The Company makes payments to self-directed grantor trusts with respect to these supplemental defined contribution plans. Such payments during Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 were not material. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the total fair values of these grantor trust investment assets, which amounts are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $7 and $9, respectively.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nNote 9 - Utility Regulatory Assets and Liabilities and Regulatory Matters\nThe following regulatory assets and liabilities associated with our Utilities reportable segment are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30:\n2022 2021\nRegulatory assets (a):\nIncome taxes recoverable $ 83 $ 143\nUnderfunded pension plans 114 108\nEnvironmental costs 37 58\nDeferred fuel and power costs 32 11\nRemoval costs, net 22 24\nOther 52 53\nTotal regulatory assets $ 340 $ 397\nRegulatory liabilities (a):\nPostretirement benefits $ 11 $ 13\nDeferred fuel and power refunds 3 36\nState income tax benefits - distribution system repairs 38 32\nExcess federal deferred income taxes 279 287\nOther 4 20\nTotal regulatory liabilities $ 335 $ 388\n(a) Current regulatory assets are recorded in Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Regulatory liabilities are recorded in Other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther than removal costs, Utilities currently does not recover a rate of return on the regulatory assets included in the table above.\nIncome taxes recoverable. This regulatory asset is the result of recording deferred tax liabilities pertaining to temporary tax differences principally as a result of the pass through to ratepayers of the tax benefit on accelerated tax depreciation for state income tax purposes, and the flow through of accelerated tax depreciation for federal income tax purposes for certain years prior to 1981. These deferred taxes have been reduced by deferred tax assets pertaining to utility deferred investment tax credits. Utilities has recorded regulatory income tax assets related to these deferred tax liabilities representing future revenues recoverable through the ratemaking process over the average remaining depreciable lives of the associated property ranging from 1 to approximately 65 years. The decrease in income taxes recoverable at September 30, 2022 reflects the impact on deferred Pennsylvania corporate income taxes resulting from changes in Pennsylvania corporate income tax rates for future years signed into law on July 8, 2022 (See Note 7).\nUnderfunded pension plans. This regulatory asset represents the portion of net actuarial losses and prior service costs (credits) associated with Gas Utility and Electric Utility pension benefits which are probable of being recovered through future rates based upon established regulatory practices. These regulatory assets are adjusted annually or more frequently under certain circumstances when the funded status of the plans is remeasured in accordance with GAAP. These costs are amortized over the average remaining future service lives of plan participants.\nEnvironmental costs. Environmental costs principally represent estimated probable future environmental remediation and investigation costs that PA Gas Utility expects to incur, primarily at MGP sites in Pennsylvania, in conjunction with a remediation COA with the PADEP. Pursuant to base rate orders, PA Gas Utility receives ratemaking recognition of its estimated environmental investigation and remediation costs associated with its environmental sites. This ratemaking recognition balances the accumulated difference between historical costs and rate recoveries with an estimate of future costs associated with the sites. The period over which PA Gas Utility expects to recover these costs will depend upon future remediation activity. For additional information on environmental costs, see Note 17.\nRemoval costs, net. This regulatory asset represents costs incurred, net of salvage, associated with the retirement of depreciable utility plant of UGI Utilities. As required by PAPUC ratemaking, removal costs include actual costs incurred associated with\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nasset retirement obligations. Consistent with prior ratemaking treatment, UGI Utilities expects to recover these costs over five years.\nPostretirement benefits. This regulatory liability represents the difference between amounts recovered through rates by PA Gas Utility and Electric Utility and actual costs incurred in accordance with accounting for postretirement benefits. A portion of this liability will be refunded to customers over the average remaining future service lives of plan participants. Another portion of this liability represents overcollections for which refund periods have been established within ratemaking proceedings. With respect to Gas Utility, postretirement benefit overcollections are generally being refunded to customers over a ten-year period beginning October 19, 2016. With respect to Electric Utility, the overcollections are being refunded to ratepayers over a 20-year period effective October 27, 2018.\nDeferred fuel and power - costs and refunds. Utilities tariffs contain clauses that permit recovery of all prudently incurred purchased gas and power costs through the application of PGC rates, PGA rates and DS tariffs. These clauses provide for periodic adjustments to PGC, PGA and DS rates for differences between the total amount of purchased gas and electric generation supply costs collected from customers and recoverable costs incurred. Net undercollected costs are classified as a regulatory asset and net overcollections are classified as a regulatory liability.\nPA Gas Utility uses derivative instruments to reduce volatility in the cost of gas it purchases for retail core-market customers. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on natural gas derivative instruments are included in deferred fuel and power costs or refunds. Net unrealized gains on such contracts at September 30, 2022 and 2021 were $5 and $35, respectively.\nState income tax benefits - distribution system repairs. This regulatory liability represents Pennsylvania state income tax benefits, net of federal benefit, resulting from the deduction for income tax purposes of repair and maintenance costs associated with UGI Utilities assets that are capitalized for regulatory and GAAP reporting. The tax benefits associated with these repair and maintenance deductions will be reflected as a reduction to income tax expense over the remaining tax lives of the related book assets.\nExcess federal deferred income taxes. This regulatory liability is the result of remeasuring Utilities federal deferred income tax liabilities on utility plant due to the enactment of the TCJA on December 22, 2017. In order for our utility assets to continue to be eligible for accelerated tax depreciation, current law requires that excess federal deferred income taxes resulting from the remeasurement be amortized no more rapidly than over the remaining lives of the assets that gave rise to the excess federal deferred income taxes, ranging from 1 year to approximately 65 years. This regulatory liability has been increased to reflect the tax benefit generated by the amortization of the excess deferred federal income taxes and is being amortized and credited to tax expense.\nOther. Other regulatory assets and liabilities comprise a number of deferred items including, among others, certain fair value adjustments related to the Mountaineer Acquisition, incremental expenses attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain information technology costs, energy efficiency conservation costs and rate case expenses.\nOther Regulatory Matters\nBase Rate Filings. On January 28, 2022, PA Gas Utility filed a request with the PAPUC to increase its base operating revenues for residential, commercial and industrial customers by $83 annually. On September 15, 2022, the PAPUC issued a final order approving a settlement providing for a $49 annual base distribution rate increase for PA Gas Utility, through a phased approach, with $38 beginning October 29, 2022 and an additional $11 beginning October 1, 2023. In accordance with the terms of the final order, PA Gas Utility will not be permitted to file a rate case prior to January 1, 2024. Also in accordance with the terms of the final order, PA Gas Utility is authorized to implement a weather normalization adjustment rider as a 5-year pilot program beginning on the effective date of the new rates. Under this rider, customer billings for distribution services will be adjusted monthly to reflect normal weather conditions if weather deviates more than 3% from normal. Additionally, under the terms of the final order, PA Gas Utility will be authorized to implement a DSIC once its total property, plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation reaches $3,368 (which threshold was achieved in September 2022).\nOn February 8, 2021, Electric Utility filed a rate request with the PAPUC to increase its annual base distribution revenues by $9. On October 28, 2021, the PAPUC issued a final Order approving a settlement that permitted Electric Utility, effective November 9, 2021, to increase its base distribution revenues by $6.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nOn January 28, 2020, PA Gas Utility filed a request with the PAPUC to increase its annual base distribution operating revenues by $75 annually. On October 8, 2020, the PAPUC issued a final Order approving a settlement that permits PA Gas Utility to increase its annual base distribution rates by $20, through a phased approach, with $10 beginning January 1, 2021 and an additional $10 beginning July 1, 2021. Additionally, PA Gas Utility was authorized to implement a DSIC once PA Gas Utility total property, plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation reaches $2,875. This threshold was achieved in December 2020 and PA Gas Utility implemented a DSIC effective April 1, 2021. The PAPUCs final Order also includes enhanced COVID-19 customer assistance measures, including the establishment of an Emergency Relief Program for a defined set of payment troubled customers (ERP). Additionally, the PAPUCs final order permits PA Gas Utility to establish a regulatory asset for certain incremental expenses attributable to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, most notably expenses related to the ERP and uncollectible accounts expense, through the effective date of rates in the next PA Gas Utility base rate case, to be recovered and amortized over a 10-year period. In accordance with the terms of the final order, PA Gas Utility was not permitted to file a rate case prior to January 1, 2022.\nNote 10 - Inventories\nInventories comprise the following at September 30:\n2022 2021\nNon-utility LPG and natural gas $ 335 $ 278\nGas Utility natural gas 166 68\nEnergy certificates 70 53\nMaterials, supplies and other 94 70\nTotal inventories $ 665 $ 469\nNote 11 - Property, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment comprise the following at September 30:\n2022 2021 Estimated Useful Life\nUtility:\nDistribution $ 4,746 $ 4,306\nTransmission 123 111\nGeneral and other 557 507\nWork in process 124 98\nTotal Utility 5,550 5,022\nNon-utility:\nLand 179 186\nBuildings and improvements 426 436 10 - 40 years\nTransportation equipment 234 232 3 - 10 years\nEquipment, primarily cylinders and tanks 3,645 3,785 5 - 30 years\nElectric generation 216 211 25 - 40 years\nPipeline and related assets 1,523 1,218 25 - 40 years\nOther 380 342 1 - 12 years\nWork in process 53 76\nTotal non-utility 6,656 6,486\nTotal property, plant and equipment $ 12,206 $ 11,508\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nThe average composite depreciation rates at our Gas Utility and Electric Utility were as follows:\n2022 2021 2020\nRegulated natural gas utilities 2.6 % 2.6 % 2.5 %\nElectric Utility 2.4 % 2.3 % 2.2 %\nDepreciation expense totaled $460, $437 and $416 for Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively.\nNote 12 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment are as follows:\nAmeriGas\nPropane UGI International Midstream & Marketing Utilities Total\nBalance September 30, 2020 $ 2,004 $ 997 $ 335 $ 182 $ 3,518\nAcquisitions - 6 - 255 261\nPurchase accounting adjustments - - 1 - 1\nForeign currency translation - (10) - - (10)\nBalance September 30, 2021 2,004 993 336 437 3,770\nPurchase accounting adjustments - - - (5) (5)\nForeign currency translation - (153) - - (153)\nBalance September 30, 2022 $ 2,004 $ 840 $ 336 $ 432 $ 3,612\nIntangible assets comprise the following at September 30:\n2022 2021\nCustomer relationships $ 1,006 $ 1,054\nTrademarks and tradenames 11 12\nNoncompete agreements and other 71 75\nAccumulated amortization (629) (607)\nIntangible assets, net (definite-lived) 459 534\nTrademarks and tradenames (indefinite-lived) 41 49\nTotal intangible assets, net $ 500 $ 583\nChanges in amounts above include the effects of currency translation.

Pursuant to the Board authorization, during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2020 the Company purchased and placed in treasury stock 900,000 shares and 950,000 shares at a total cost of $38 and $38, respectively. There were no such repurchases during Fiscal 2021.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nUGI Preferred Stock and Common Stock share activity for Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 is as follows:\nPreferred Stock Common Stock\nIssued/Outstanding Issued Treasury Outstanding\nBalance at September 30, 2019 - 209,304,129 (299,340) 209,004,789\nIssued:\nEmployee and director plans - 209,915 180,050 389,965\nRepurchases of common stock - - (950,000) (950,000)\nReacquired common stock - employee and director plans - - (90,316) (90,316)\nBalance at September 30, 2020 - 209,514,044 (1,159,606) 208,354,438\nIssued:\nEquity Unit Offering 220,000\nEmployee and director plans - 329,252 554,315 883,567\nReacquired common stock - employee and director plans - - (21,870) (21,870)\nBalance at Balance at September 30, 2021 220,000 209,843,296 (627,161) 209,216,135\nIssued:\nEmployee and director plans - 717,198 799,152 1,516,350\nRepurchases of common stock - - (900,000) (900,000)\nReacquired common stock - employee and director plans - - (250,273) (250,273)\nBalance at September 30, 2022 220,000 210,560,494 (978,282) 209,582,212\nUGI also has 5,000,000 shares of UGI Series Preference Stock authorized for issuance. UGI had no shares of UGI Series Preference Stock outstanding at September 30, 2022 or 2021.\nIssuance of Equity Units\nOn May 25, 2021, the Company issued 2.2 million Equity Units with a total notional value of $220. Each Equity Unit has a stated amount of $100 and consists of (i) a 10% undivided beneficial ownership interest in one share of Convertible Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share and (ii) a 2024 Purchase Contract. The Company received approximately $213 of proceeds from the issuance of the Equity Units, net of offering expenses and underwriting costs and commissions, and issued 220,000 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock which was recorded in Preferred stock on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The proceeds were used to pay a portion of the purchase price for the Mountaineer Acquisition and related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2022, the Company reclassified certain amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity related to the accounting for the Equity Units.\nConvertible Preferred Stock. Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock will generally have no voting rights, except under the limited circumstances as described in the Equity Unit Agreements, and will be entitled to receive cumulative dividends at an initial annual rate of 0.125% when, as, and if declared by the UGI Board of Directors, payable quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1, commencing September 1, 2021. The Company may elect to pay such dividends in cash, shares of UGIs common stock or a combination of cash and shares of UGIs common stock. Unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock for prior completed dividend periods have been declared and paid, the Company may not make any distributions on, or repurchase, any of its capital stock ranking equal or junior to the Convertible Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Convertible Preferred Stock has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless converted by holders or redeemed by the Company. The Company has the option to redeem all or a portion of the Convertible Preferred Stock at any time, and from time to time, on or after September 3, 2024, for cash at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference of the Convertible Preferred Stock being redeemed plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends. Each share of Convertible Preferred Stock may be converted at the option of the holders on and after June 1, 2024, only after it has been separated from the Equity Units and, prior to June 1, 2024, only under limited circumstances in connection with a fundamental change, as defined in the Equity Unit\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nAgreements. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering (i) one share of UGIs 0.125% Series B preferred stock (or, for conversions in connection with a redemption of the Convertible Preferred Stock, up to $1,000 per share in cash plus all accumulated but unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the payment date immediately preceding the relevant conversion date) per share of Convertible Preferred Stock being converted; and (ii) to the extent the conversion value exceeds the liquidation preference of the Convertible Preferred Stock, shares of UGIs common stock. The conversion rate is initially 19.0215 shares of UGIs common stock per one share of Convertible Preferred Stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $52.57 per share of UGIs common stock. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, there were 220,000 shares of Series B preferred stock authorized for issuance pursuant to the settlement terms discussed above.\nThe Convertible Preferred Stock can be remarketed during either (i) an optional remarketing period beginning on, and including, March 1, 2024 and ending on, and including, May 13, 2024 or (ii) a final remarketing period beginning on, and including, May 23, 2024 and ending on, and including, May 30, 2024. In connection with a successful remarketing, the conversion rate and dividend rate of the Convertible Preferred Stock may be increased, and the earliest redemption date for the Convertible Preferred Stock may be changed to a later date that is on or before August 29, 2025.\n2024 Purchase Contracts. The 2024 Purchase Contracts obligate the holders to pay $100 to UGI to purchase a variable number of shares of UGI common stock on the purchase contract settlement date, which is scheduled to occur on June 1, 2024. The number of shares of UGI common stock to be issued upon settlement of each 2024 Purchase Contract on the purchase contract settlement date will be equal to $100 divided by the market value per share of UGI common stock, which will be determined over a market value averaging period preceding the settlement date, subject to a maximum settlement rate of 2.2826 shares of UGI common stock per 2024 Purchase Contract, subject to adjustment. The initial maximum settlement rate of the 2024 Purchase Contracts is approximately equal to $100 divided by the last reported sale price of $43.81 per share of UGI common stock on May 17, 2021. Absent any fundamental changes, as defined in the Equity Unit Agreements, the holders can settle the 2024 Purchase Contracts early, subject to certain exceptions and conditions. Upon early settlement of any 2024 Purchase Contracts, other than in connection with a fundamental change, the Company will deliver the number of shares of UGI common stock equal to 85% of the number of shares of UGI common stock that would have otherwise been deliverable.\nThe Company will pay holders of the 2024 Purchase Contracts quarterly contract adjustment payments at an annual rate of 7.125%, payable quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1, commencing September 1, 2021. The Company may elect to pay such contract adjustment payments in cash, shares of UGI common stock or a combination of cash and shares of UGI common stock. The Company may defer the contract adjustment payments for one or more consecutive periods but generally not beyond the purchase contract settlement date. If contract adjustment payments are deferred, the Company will be subject to certain dividend, distribution, and other restrictions related to its capital stock as defined in the Equity Unit Agreements.\nThe present value of the quarterly contract adjustment payments liability was $45 upon issuance of the Equity Units and is recorded in Other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities (with a corresponding reduction to UGI Preferred Stock) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As each quarterly contract adjustment payment is made, the related liability is reduced and the difference between the cash payment and the present value will accrete to Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. This accretion was not material during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021.\nNote 14 - Equity-Based Compensation\nThe Company grants equity-based awards to employees and non-employee directors comprising UGI stock options and, UGI Common Stock-based equity instruments. We recognized total pre-tax equity-based compensation expense of $15 ($11 after-tax), $21 ($15 after-tax) and $15 ($11 after-tax) in Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively.\nUGI Equity-Based Compensation Plans and Awards. On January 29, 2021, the Companys shareholders approved the 2021 IAP. Under the 2021 IAP, awards representing up to 20,500,000 shares of UGI Common Stock may be granted. UGI Unit Awards granted to employees and non-employee directors, including dividend equivalents, are settled in shares of UGI Common Stock and cash. The 2021 IAP supersedes and replaces the 2013 OICP for awards granted on or after February 1, 2021. The terms and conditions of the 2013 OICP will continue to govern any outstanding awards granted thereunder. Similar to the 2013 OICP, under the 2021 IAP, we may grant options to acquire shares of UGI Common Stock, SARs, UGI Units (comprising Stock Units and UGI Performance Units), other equity-based awards and cash to key employees and non-employee directors. The exercise price for options may not be less than the fair market value on the grant date. Awards granted under the 2021 IAP may vest immediately or ratably over a period of years, and stock options can be exercised no later than ten years from the grant date. Except in the event of retirement, death or disability, each grant, unless paid, will terminate when the\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nparticipant ceases to be employed. There are certain change of control and retirement eligibility conditions that, if met, generally result in accelerated vesting or elimination of further service requirements.\nThere were 18,015,916 shares of Common Stock available for future grants under the 2021 IAP at September 30, 2022.\nUGI Stock Option Awards. We measure the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses certain key assumptions for such options related to the expected life, volatility, dividend yield and the Companys risk-free rate at the valuation date. The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted under our option plans was $8.47, $6.05 and $5.58 in Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, there was $5 of unrecognized compensation cost associated with unvested stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years. There were 9,004,896 stock options outstanding at September 30, 2022, of which, 7,179,583 stock options were exercisable with a weighted-average option price of $42.23.\nUGI Unit Awards. UGI Stock Unit and UGI Performance Unit awards entitle the grantee to shares of UGI Common Stock or cash once the service condition is met and, with respect to UGI Performance Unit awards, subject to market performance conditions. UGI Performance Unit grant recipients are awarded a target number of UGI Performance Units. The number of UGI Performance Units ultimately paid at the end of the performance period (generally three years) may be higher or lower than the target amount, or even zero, based on UGIs TSR percentile rank relative to the UGI comparator group. Grantees may receive 0% to 200% of the target award granted.\nThe fair value of UGI Stock Units on the grant date is equal to the market price of UGI Stock on the grant date plus the fair value of dividend equivalents if applicable. The fair value of UGI Performance Units is estimated using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value associated with the target award is accounted for as equity and the fair value of the award over the target, as well as all dividend equivalents, is accounted for as a liability.\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of UGI Stock Units and UGI Performance Units granted to employees during Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020 was $51.24, $41.41 and $41.47, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2022, there was a total of $24 unrecognized compensation cost associated with UGI Unit awards outstanding that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years. As of September 30, 2022, there were 1,376,371 UGI Unit awards outstanding with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $42.31 per share.\nNote 15 - Partnership Distributions\nIn accordance with the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership makes distributions to its partners approximately 45 days after the end of each fiscal quarter in a total amount equal to its Available Cash (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) for such quarter. The General Partner may establish reserves for the proper conduct of the Partnerships business and for distributions during the next four quarters.\nNote 16 - Leases\nLessee\nWe lease various buildings and other facilities, real estate, vehicles, rail cars and other equipment, the majority of which are operating leases. We determine if a contract is or contains a lease by evaluating whether the contract explicitly or implicitly identifies an asset, whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of the identified leased asset and to direct its use.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We recognize ROU assets at the lease commencement date at the value of the lease liability adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. These payments are discounted using the discount rate implicit in the lease, when available. We apply an incremental borrowing rate, which is\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\ndeveloped utilizing a credit notching approach based on information available at the lease commencement date, to substantially all of our leases as the implicit rate is often not available.\nLease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. Renewal and termination options are not included in the lease term unless we are reasonably certain that such options will be exercised. Leases with an original lease term of one year or less, including consideration of any renewal options assumed to be exercised, are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCertain lease arrangements, primarily fleet vehicle leases with lease terms of one to ten years, contain purchase options. The Company generally excludes purchase options in evaluating its leases unless it is reasonably certain that such options will be exercised. Additionally, leases of fleet vehicles often contain residual value guarantees that are due at the end of the lease. Such amounts are included in the determination of lease liabilities when we are reasonably certain that they will be owed.\nCertain leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on asset usage or are based on changes in index rates, such as the Consumer Price Index. The variable payments component of such leases cannot be determined at lease commencement and is not recognized in the measurement of ROU assets or lease liabilities, but is recognized in earnings in the period in which the obligation occurs.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nROU assets and lease liabilities recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30 are as follows:\n2022 2021 Location on the Balance Sheet\nROU assets:\nOperating lease ROU assets $ 368 $ 390 Other assets\nFinance lease ROU assets 48 49 Property, plant and equipment\nTotal ROU assets $ 416 $ 439\nLease liabilities:\nOperating lease liabilities - current $ 82 $ 81 Other current liabilities\nOperating lease liabilities - noncurrent 294 318 Other noncurrent liabilities\nFinance lease liabilities - current 4 4 Current maturities of long-term debt\nFinance lease liabilities - noncurrent 41 41 Long-term debt\nTotal lease liabilities $ 421 $ 444\nThe components of lease cost for Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 are as follows:\n2022 2021 2020\nOperating lease cost $ 96 $ 101 $ 102\nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of ROU assets 4 4 5\nInterest on lease liabilities 3 3 3\nVariable lease cost 6 4 5\nShort-term lease cost 2 2 3\nTotal lease cost $ 111 $ 114 $ 118\nThe following table presents the cash and non-cash activity related to lease liabilities included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows during Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020:\n2022 2021 2020\nCash paid related to lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows - operating leases $ 95 $ 99 $ 103\nOperating cash flows - finance leases $ 3 $ 3 $ 3\nFinancing cash flows - finance leases $ 2 $ 3 $ 4\nNon-cash lease liability activities:\nROU assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities (a) $ 72 $ 85 $ 506\nROU assets obtained in exchange for finance lease liabilities $ 2 $ 1 $ 22\n(a) Fiscal 2020 includes the impact of the adoption of ASC 842 - Leases.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nThe following table presents the weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate:\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years) 2022 2021\nOperating leases 6.0 6.3\nFinance leases 3.7 2.4\nWeighted-average discount rate (%) 2022 2021\nOperating leases 3.6% 3.6%\nFinance leases 1.8% 1.5%\nExpected annual lease payments based on maturities of operating and finance leases, as well as a reconciliation to the lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as of September 30, 2022, were as follows:\n2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 After 2027 Total Lease Payments Imputed Interest Lease Liabilities\nOperating leases $ 93 $ 81 $ 64 $ 52 $ 41 $ 86 $ 417 $ (41) $ 376\nFinance leases $ 4 $ 4 $ 4 $ 4 $ 3 $ 77 $ 96 $ (51) $ 45\nApproximately 85% of the operating lease liabilities presented above relate to AmeriGas Propane.\nAt September 30, 2022, operating and finance leases that had not yet commenced were not material.\nLessor\nWe enter into lessor arrangements for the purposes of storing, gathering or distributing natural gas and LPG. AmeriGas Propane and UGI International have lessor arrangements that grant customers the right to use small, medium and large storage tanks, which we classify as operating leases. These agreements contain renewal options for periods up to nine years and certain agreements at UGI International contain a purchase option. Energy Services leases certain natural gas gathering assets to customers, which we classify as operating leases. Lease income is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income (see Note 4).\nNote 17 - Commitments and Contingencies\nEnvironmental Matters\nUGI Utilities\nFrom the late 1800s through the mid-1900s, UGI Utilities and its former subsidiaries owned and operated a number of MGPs prior to the general availability of natural gas. Some constituents of coal tars and other residues of the manufactured gas process are today considered hazardous substances under the Superfund Law and may be present on the sites of former MGPs. Between 1882 and 1953, UGI Utilities owned the stock of subsidiary gas companies in Pennsylvania and elsewhere and also operated the businesses of some gas companies under agreement. By the early 1950s, UGI Utilities divested all of its utility operations other than certain gas and electric operations. Beginning in 2006 and 2008, UGI Utilities also owned and operated two acquired subsidiaries, with similar histories of owning, and in some cases operating, MGPs in Pennsylvania.\nUGI Utilities is subject to a COA with the PADEP to address the remediation of specified former MGP sites in Pennsylvania, which is scheduled to terminate at the end of 2031. In accordance with the COA, UGI Utilities is required to either obtain a certain number of points per calendar year based on defined eligible environmental investigatory and/or remedial activities at the MGPs, or make expenditures for such activities in an amount equal to an annual environmental minimum expenditure threshold. The annual minimum expenditure threshold of the COA is $5. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, our aggregate estimated accrued liabilities for environmental investigation and remediation costs related to the current COA and the predecessor agreements totaled $53 and $50, respectively.\nWe do not expect the costs for investigation and remediation of hazardous substances at Pennsylvania MGP sites to be material to UGI Utilities results of operations because UGI Utilities receives ratemaking recovery of actual environmental investigation and remediation costs associated with the sites covered by the COA. This ratemaking recognition reconciles the accumulated\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\ndifference between historical costs and rate recoveries with an estimate of future costs associated with the sites. As such, UGI Utilities has recorded an associated regulatory asset for these costs because recovery of these costs from customers is probable (see Note 9).\nFrom time to time, UGI Utilities is notified of sites outside Pennsylvania on which private parties allege MGPs were formerly owned or operated by UGI Utilities or owned or operated by a former subsidiary. Such parties generally investigate the extent of environmental contamination or perform environmental remediation. Management believes that under applicable law UGI Utilities should not be liable in those instances in which a former subsidiary owned or operated an MGP. There could be, however, significant future costs of an uncertain amount associated with environmental damage caused by MGPs outside Pennsylvania that UGI Utilities directly operated, or that were owned or operated by a former subsidiary of UGI Utilities if a court were to conclude that (1) the subsidiarys separate corporate form should be disregarded, or (2) UGI Utilities should be considered to have been an operator because of its conduct with respect to its subsidiarys MGP. Neither the undiscounted nor the accrued liability for environmental investigation and cleanup costs for UGI Utilities MGP sites outside Pennsylvania were material for all periods presented.\nAmeriGas Propane\nAmeriGas OLP Saranac Lake. In 2008, the NYDEC notified AmeriGas OLP that the NYDEC had placed property purportedly owned by AmeriGas OLP in Saranac Lake, New York on the New York State Registry of Inactive Hazardous Waste Disposal Sites. A site characterization study performed by the NYDEC disclosed contamination related to a former MGP. AmeriGas OLP responded to the NYDEC in 2009 to dispute the contention it was a PRP as it did not operate the MGP and appeared to only own a portion of the site. In 2017, the NYDEC communicated to AmeriGas OLP that the NYDEC had previously issued three RODs related to remediation of the site totaling approximately $28 and requested additional information regarding AmeriGas OLPs purported ownership. AmeriGas OLP renewed its challenge to designation as a PRP and identified potential defenses. The NYDEC subsequently identified a third party PRP with respect to the site.\nThe NYDEC commenced implementation of the remediation plan in the spring of 2018. Based on our evaluation of the available information as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Partnership has an undiscounted environmental remediation liability of $8 related to the site. Our share of the actual remediation costs could be significantly more or less than the accrued amount.\nAlthough we cannot predict the final results of these pending claims and legal actions, we believe, after consultation with counsel, that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material effect on our financial statements.\nIn addition to the matters described above, there are other pending claims and legal actions arising in the normal course of our businesses. Although we cannot predict the final results of these pending claims and legal actions, we believe, after consultation with counsel, that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material effect on our financial statements.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nNote 18 - Fair Value Measurements\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nThe following table presents, on a gross basis, our financial assets and liabilities, including both current and noncurrent portions, that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis within the fair value hierarchy as described in Note 2:\nAsset (Liability)\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nSeptember 30, 2022:\nDerivative instruments:\nAssets:\nCommodity contracts (b) $ 938 $ 1,268 $ 27 $ 2,233\nForeign currency contracts $ - $ 119 $ - $ 119\nInterest rate contracts $ - $ 66 $ - $ 66\nLiabilities:\nCommodity contracts (b) $ (377) $ (136) $ - $ (513)\nForeign currency contracts $ - $ (2) $ - $ (2)\nNon-qualified supplemental postretirement grantor trust investments (a) $ 43 $ - $ - $ 43\nSeptember 30, 2021\nDerivative instruments:\nAssets:\nCommodity contracts $ 641 $ 1,008 $ - $ 1,649\nForeign currency contracts $ - $ 38 $ - $ 38\nLiabilities:\nCommodity contracts $ (264) $ (16) $ - $ (280)\nForeign currency contracts $ - $ (8) $ - $ (8)\nInterest rate contracts $ - $ (29) $ - $ (29)\nNon-qualified supplemental postretirement grantor trust investments (a) $ 53 $ - $ - $ 53\n(a)Consists primarily of mutual fund investments held in grantor trusts associated with non-qualified supplemental retirement plans (see Note 8).\n(b)Includes derivative assets and liabilities held-for-sale associated with the October 2022 sale of the United Kingdom energy marketing business (see Note 25).\nThe fair values of our Level 1 exchange-traded commodity futures and option contracts and non-exchange-traded commodity futures and forward contracts are based upon actively quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities. Substantially all of the remaining derivative instruments are designated as Level 2. The fair values of certain non-exchange-traded commodity derivatives designated as Level 2 are based upon indicative price quotations available through brokers, industry price publications or recent market transactions and related market indicators. The fair values of our Level 2 interest rate contracts and foreign currency contracts are based upon third-party quotes or indicative values based on recent market transactions. The Level 3 measurements reflect natural gas commodity contracts attributable to our UGI International operations. The fair values of these contracts have been determined using unobservable inputs in an illiquid market, and the fair values of such Level 3 measurements ranged from $7 to $27 given the available inputs considered. The actual realized value at which these contracts will settle could vary significantly compared to the fair values reflected at September 30, 2022. The fair values of investments held in grantor trusts are derived from quoted market prices as substantially all of the investments in these trusts have active markets.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nOther Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts of other financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities (except for current maturities of long-term debt) approximate their fair values because of their short-term nature. We estimate the fair value of long-term debt by using current market rates and by discounting future cash flows using rates available for similar type debt (Level 2). The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our long-term debt (including current maturities but excluding unamortized debt issuance costs) were as follows:\n2022 2021\nCarrying amount $ 6,665 $ 6,491\nEstimated fair value $ 6,189 $ 6,996\nFinancial instruments other than derivative instruments, such as short-term investments and trade accounts receivable, could expose us to concentrations of credit risk. We limit credit risk from short-term investments by investing only in investment-grade commercial paper, money market mutual funds, securities guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies and FDIC insured bank deposits. The credit risk arising from concentrations of trade accounts receivable is limited because we have a large customer base that extends across many different U.S. markets and a number of foreign countries. For information regarding concentrations of credit risk associated with our derivative instruments, see Note 19.\nNote 19 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe are exposed to certain market risks related to our ongoing business operations. Management uses derivative financial and commodity instruments, among other things, to manage: (1) commodity price risk; (2) interest rate risk; and (3) foreign currency exchange rate risk. Although we use derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market risk associated with forecasted transactions, we do not use derivative financial and commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The use of derivative instruments is controlled by our risk management and credit policies, which govern, among other things, the derivative instruments we can use, counterparty credit limits and contract authorization limits. Although our commodity derivative instruments extend over a number of years, a significant portion of our commodity derivative instruments economically hedge commodity price risk during the next twelve months. For information on the accounting for our derivative instruments, see Note 2.\nThe following summarizes the types of derivative instruments used by the Company to manage certain market risks:\nCommodity Price Risk\nRegulated Utility Operations\nNatural Gas\nPA Gas Utilitys tariffs contain clauses that permit recovery of all prudently incurred costs of natural gas it sells to retail core-market customers, including the cost of financial instruments used to hedge purchased gas costs. As permitted and agreed to by the PAPUC pursuant to PA Gas Utilitys annual PGC filings, PA Gas Utility currently uses NYMEX natural gas futures and option contracts to reduce commodity price volatility associated with a portion of the natural gas it purchases for its retail core-market customers. See Note 9 for further information on the regulatory accounting treatment for these derivative instruments.\nNon-utility Operations\nLPG\nIn order to manage market price risk associated with the Partnerships fixed-price programs and to reduce the effects of short-term commodity price volatility, the Partnership uses over-the-counter derivative commodity instruments, principally price swap contracts. In addition, the Partnership and our UGI International operations also use over-the-counter price swap and option contracts to reduce commodity price volatility associated with a portion of their forecasted LPG purchases.\nNatural Gas\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nIn order to manage market price risk relating to fixed-price sales contracts for physical natural gas, Midstream & Marketing enters into NYMEX and over-the-counter natural gas futures and over-the-counter and ICE natural gas basis swap contracts. In addition, Midstream & Marketing uses NYMEX and over-the-counter futures and options contracts to economically hedge price volatility associated with the gross margin derived from the purchase and anticipated later near-term sale of natural gas storage inventories. Outside of the financial market, Midstream & Marketing also uses ICE and over-the-counter forward physical contracts. UGI International also uses natural gas futures and forward contracts to economically hedge market price risk associated with a substantial portion of anticipated volumes under fixed-price sales contracts with its customers.\nElectricity\nIn order to manage market price risk relating to fixed-price sales contracts for electricity, Midstream & Marketing enters into electricity futures and forward contracts. Midstream & Marketing also uses NYMEX and over-the-counter electricity futures contracts to economically hedge the price of a portion of its anticipated future sales of electricity from its electric generation facilities. UGI International also uses electricity futures and forward contracts to economically hedge market price risk associated with fixed-price sales and purchase contracts for electricity.\nInterest Rate Risk\nCertain of our long-term debt agreements have interest rates that are generally indexed to short-term market interest rates. In order to fix the underlying short-term market interest rates, we may enter into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap agreements and designate such swaps as cash flow hedges.\nThe remainder of our long-term debt is typically issued at fixed rates of interest. As this long-term debt matures, we typically refinance such debt with new debt having interest rates reflecting then-current market conditions. In order to reduce market rate risk on the underlying benchmark rate of interest associated with near- to medium-term forecasted issuances of fixed-rate debt, from time to time we enter into IRPAs. We account for IRPAs as cash flow hedges. There were no unsettled IRPAs during any of the periods presented. At September 30, 2022, the amount of pre-tax net losses associated with interest rate hedges (excluding pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps) expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months is $3.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nForward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts\nIn order to reduce the volatility in net income associated with our foreign operations, principally as a result of changes in the USD exchange rate to the euro and British pound sterling, we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. We layer in these foreign currency exchange contracts over a multi-year period to eventually equal approximately 90% of anticipated UGI International foreign currency earnings before income taxes. Because these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments, realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other non-operating income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nNet Investment Hedges\nFrom time to time, we also enter into certain forward foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the volatility of the USD value of a portion of our UGI International euro-denominated net investments, including anticipated foreign currency denominated dividends. We account for these foreign currency exchange contracts as net investment hedges and all changes in the fair value of these contracts are reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component in AOCI. We use the spot rate method to measure ineffectiveness of our net investment hedges.\nConcurrent with the repayment of UGI Internationals 3.25% Senior Notes on December 7, 2021, we settled an associated net investment hedge having a notional value of \u20ac93. Additionally, in May 2022, we restructured certain net investment hedges associated with anticipated foreign currency denominated dividends. Cash flows from these transactions are included in cash flows from investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We recognized pre-tax gains associated with net investment hedges in the foreign currency component of AOCI totaling $69 during Fiscal 2022.\nOur euro-denominated long-term debt has also been designated as net investment hedges, representing a portion of our UGI International euro-denominated net investment. We recognized pre-tax gains (losses) associated with these net investment\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nhedges in the foreign currency component of AOCI totaling $123, $9 and $(53) during Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020, respectively.\nQuantitative Disclosures Related to Derivative Instruments\nThe following table summarizes by derivative type the gross notional amounts related to open derivative contracts at September 30, 2022 and 2021 and the final settlement dates of the Company's open derivative contracts as of September 30, 2022, (including amounts associated with our energy marketing businesses in the United Kingdom and France (Note 25)) but excluding those derivatives that qualified for the NPNS exception:\nNotional Amounts\n(in millions)\nSeptember 30,\nType Units Settlements Extending Through 2022 2021\nCommodity Price Risk:\nRegulated Utility Operations\nPA Gas Utility NYMEX natural gas futures and option contracts Dekatherms October 2023 19 20\nNon-utility Operations\nLPG swaps Gallons January 2025 874 708\nNatural gas futures, forward, basis swap, options and pipeline contracts Dekatherms October 2026 363 355\nElectricity forward and futures contracts Kilowatt hours December 2026 2,446 4,302\nInterest Rate Risk:\nInterest rate swaps Euro October 2022 \u20ac 300 \u20ac 300\nInterest rate swaps USD June 2026 $ 1,358 $ 1,421\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk:\nForward foreign exchange contracts USD August 2025 $ 465 $ 509\nNet investment hedge forward foreign exchange contracts Euro December 2026 \u20ac 411 \u20ac 173\nDerivative Instrument Credit Risk\nWe are exposed to risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our derivative instrument counterparties. Our derivative instrument counterparties principally comprise large energy companies and major U.S. and international financial institutions. We maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe reduce overall credit risk. These policies include evaluating and monitoring our counterparties financial condition, including their credit ratings, and entering into agreements with counterparties that govern credit limits or entering into netting agreements that allow for offsetting counterparty receivable and payable balances for certain financial transactions, as deemed appropriate.\nWe have concentrations of credit risk associated with derivative instruments and we evaluate the creditworthiness of our derivative counterparties on an ongoing basis. As of September 30, 2022, the maximum amount of loss, based upon the gross fair values of the derivative instruments, we would incur if these counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of their contracts was $2,418. In general, many of our over-the-counter derivative instruments and all exchange contracts call for the posting of collateral by the counterparty or by the Company in the forms of letters of credit, parental guarantees or cash. At September 30, 2022, we had received cash collateral from derivative instrument counterparties totaling $398. In addition, we may have offsetting derivative liabilities and certain accounts payable balances with certain of these counterparties, which further mitigates the previously mentioned maximum amount of losses. Certain of the Partnerships derivative contracts have credit-risk-related contingent features that may require the posting of additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of the Partnerships debt rating. At September 30, 2022, if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered, the amount of collateral required to be posted would not be material.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nOffsetting Derivative Assets and Liabilities\nDerivative assets and liabilities are presented net by counterparty on the Consolidated Balance Sheets if the right of offset exists. We offset amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral against amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty. Our derivative instruments include both those that are executed on an exchange through brokers and centrally cleared and over-the-counter transactions. Exchange contracts utilize a financial intermediary, exchange, or clearinghouse to enter, execute, or clear the transactions. Over-the-counter contracts are bilateral contracts that are transacted directly with a third party. Certain over-the-counter and exchange contracts contain contractual rights of offset through master netting arrangements, derivative clearing agreements, and contract default provisions. In addition, the contracts are subject to conditional rights of offset through counterparty nonperformance, insolvency or other conditions.\nIn general, many of our over-the-counter transactions and all exchange contracts are subject to collateral requirements. Types of collateral generally include cash or letters of credit. Cash collateral paid by us to our over-the-counter derivative counterparties, if any, is reflected in the table below to offset derivative liabilities. Cash collateral received by us from our over-the-counter derivative counterparties, if any, is reflected in the table below to offset derivative assets. Certain other accounts receivable and accounts payable balances recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with our derivative counterparties are not included in the table below but could reduce our net exposure to such counterparties because such balances are subject to master netting or similar arrangements.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nFair Value of Derivative Instruments\nThe following table presents the Companys derivative assets and liabilities by type, as well as the effects of offsetting, as of September 30:\n2022 2021\nDerivative assets:\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign currency contracts $ 57 $ 20\nInterest rate contracts 66 -\n123 20\nDerivatives subject to PGC and DS mechanisms:\nCommodity contracts 31 58\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nCommodity contracts (a) 2,202 1,591\nForeign currency contracts 62 18\n2,264 1,609\nTotal derivative assets - gross 2,418 1,687\nGross amounts offset in the balance sheet (295) (216)\nCash collateral received (398) (468)\nTotal derivative assets - net $ 1,725 $ 1,003\nDerivative liabilities:\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate contracts $ - $ (29)\nDerivatives subject to PGC and DS mechanisms:\nCommodity contracts (26) (23)\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nCommodity contracts (a) (487) (257)\nForeign currency contracts (2) (8)\n(489) (265)\nTotal derivative liabilities - gross (515) (317)\nGross amounts offset in the balance sheet 295 216\nCash collateral pledged 7 3\nTotal derivative liabilities - net $ (213) $ (98)\n(a)Includes derivative assets and liabilities held-for-sale associated with the October 2022 sale of the United Kingdom energy marketing business (see Note 25).\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nEffects of Derivative Instruments\nThe following tables provide information on the effects of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Income and changes in AOCI for Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020:\nGain (Loss)\nRecognized in\nAOCI Gain (Loss)\nReclassified from\nAOCI into Income Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from\nAOCI into Income\n2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nCash Flow Hedges:\nInterest rate contracts 91 4 (53) (7) (25) (13) Interest expense\nNet Investment Hedges:\nForeign currency contracts $ 69 $ 4 $ (1)\nGain (Loss)\nRecognized in Income Location of\nGain (Loss)\nRecognized in Income\n2022 2021 2020\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:\nCommodity contracts $ (9) $ (17) $ 10 Revenues\nCommodity contracts 1,181 1,545 (32) Cost of sales\nCommodity contracts 1 5 - Other operating income, net\nForeign currency contracts 63 9 (20) Other non-operating income (expense), net\nTotal $ 1,236 $ 1,542 $ (42)\nWe are also a party to a number of other contracts that have elements of a derivative instrument. However, these contracts qualify for NPNS exception accounting because they provide for the delivery of products or services in quantities that are expected to be used in the normal course of operating our business and the price in the contract is based on an underlying that is directly associated with the price of the product or service being purchased or sold. These contracts include, among others, binding purchase orders, contracts that provide for the purchase and delivery, or sale, of energy products, and service contracts that require the counterparty to provide commodity storage, transportation or capacity service to meet our normal sales commitments.\nNote 20 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) principally comprises (1) gains and losses on derivative instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges, net of reclassifications to net income; (2) actuarial gains and losses on postretirement benefit plans, net of associated amortization; and (3) foreign currency translation and long-term intra-company transaction adjustments.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nThe tables below present changes in AOCI, net of tax, during Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020:\nPostretirement\nBenefit\nPlans Derivative\nInstruments Foreign\nCurrency Total\nAOCI - September 30, 2019 $ (26) $ (25) $ (166) $ (217)\nOther comprehensive (loss) income before reclassification adjustments (3) (38) 99 58\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI 3 9 - 12\nOther comprehensive (loss) income attributable to UGI - (29) 99 70\nAOCI - September 30, 2020 $ (26) $ (54) $ (67) $ (147)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassification adjustments 7 3 (23) (13)\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI 2 18 - 20\nOther comprehensive income (loss) attributable to UGI 9 21 (23) 7\nAOCI - September 30, 2021 $ (17) $ (33) $ (90) $ (140)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassification adjustments 28 64 (341) (249)\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI 3 6 - 9\nOther comprehensive income (loss) attributable to UGI 31 70 (341) (240)\nAOCI - September 30, 2022 $ 14 $ 37 $ (431) $ (380)\nNote 21 - Other Operating Income, Net and Other Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net\nOther Operating Income, Net\nOther operating income, net, comprises the following:\n2022 2021 2020\nFinance charges $ 18 $ 17 $ 9\nGains on sales of fixed assets, net 33 11 5\nGain on early derivative termination - 5 -\nInterest and interest-related income 1 - 2\nOther, net 27 - 5\nTotal other operating income, net $ 79 $ 33 $ 21\nOther Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net\nOther non-operating income (expense), net comprises the following:\n2022 2021 2020\nGains (losses) on foreign currency contracts, net $ 63 $ 9 $ (20)\nAmortization of excluded components of certain net investment hedges\n7 2 -\nPension and other postretirement plans non-service income, net 5 1 -\nTotal other non-operating income (expense), net $ 75 $ 12 $ (20)\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nNote 22 - Equity Method Investments\nDuring Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, the Companys principal equity method investments comprised Pine Run, Pennant and PennEast which are reflected in our Midstream and Marketing Segment. Our equity method investments are included within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $130 and $174 at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPine Run. The Company has an approximately 49% interest in Pine Run, a company jointly owned by Stonehenge Energy Resources and UGI Pine Run, LLC. In February 2021, Pine Run, completed the acquisition of Pine Run Midstream, an affiliate of PennEnergy, and minority partners for approximately $205. The acquisition was funded by cash contributions by UGI Pine Run, LLC and Stonehenge Energy Resources totaling approximately $115, and the issuance by Pine Run of $90 of long-term debt. Pine Run Midstream operates dry gas gathering pipelines and compression assets in western Pennsylvania. Pine Run is accounted for as an equity method investment as we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the entity. The carrying value of our investment in Pine Run at September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $68 and $60, respectively.\nPennant. As of September 30, 2021, Energy Services held a 47% membership interest in Pennant, a natural gas gathering system located in northeast Ohio and western Pennsylvania. In Fiscal 2022, relating to the Companys acquisition of a controlling interest in Pennant, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary pre-tax impairment charge of $44 related to its 47% membership interest, which was recorded in (Loss) income from equity investees in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company acquired the outstanding interest in Pennant during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022. See Note 5 for additional information related to the acquired interest in Pennant. The carrying value of our investment in Pennant at September 30, 2021 was $93.\nPennEast. UGI PennEast, LLC and four other members comprising wholly owned subsidiaries of Southern Company, New Jersey Resources, South Jersey Industries, and Enbridge, Inc., each hold a 20% membership interest in PennEast. PennEast was formed to construct an approximate 120-mile natural gas pipeline from Luzerne County, Pennsylvania to the Trenton-Woodbury interconnection in New Jersey. PennEast is accounted for as an equity method investment as we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over PennEast. In September 2019, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that New Jerseys Eleventh Amendment immunity barred PennEast from bringing an eminent domain lawsuit in federal court, under the Natural Gas Act, against New Jersey or its agencies. On February 3, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order granting PennEasts petition for a writ of certiorari and the case was argued on April 28, 2021. On June 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of PennEast, overturning the Third Circuits decision that blocked PennEast from exercising federal eminent domain authority over lands in which a state has property rights interests.\nFollowing the favorable Supreme Court decision, the partners of the PennEast project re-assessed the remaining legal and regulatory contingencies which needed to be resolved before construction could commence. Based on the significant remaining legal challenges and the expected further delays in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals, which were preventing the commencement of construction and commercial operation of the project, the Company concluded that its investment in PennEast was impaired at June 30, 2021, and that such impairment was other-than-temporary. The estimated fair value of the Companys investment in PennEast was measured using probability-weighted cash flows under an expected present value technique based on management's estimates and assumptions regarding the likelihood of certain outcomes (and the related timing) that would be used by market participants at the time. Based upon this analysis, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary pre-tax impairment charge of $93 in June 2021, which is recorded in (Loss) income from equity investees in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nOn September 27, 2021, the PennEast partners announced that further development of the project is no longer supported. Following this announcement, the estimated fair value was assessed using the liquidation value of equipment held by PennEast and did not result in a significant change compared to June 30, 2021 and no further impairment loss was recognized. The estimated fair value of the Companys investment in PennEast was determined to be a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022, the Company recognized $9 of equity earnings related to the ongoing liquidation of PennEast assets. The carrying value of our investment in PennEast at September 30, 2022 and 2021 was not material.\nOther Equity Investments. Our other equity investments totaled $62 and $21 at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and principally comprise investments in biomass and other renewable energy projects at Midstream and Marketing and, in Fiscal 2022, an investment in a renewable energy joint venture at UGI International.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nNote 23 - Segment Information\nOur operations comprise four reportable segments generally based upon products or services sold, geographic location and regulatory environment: (1) AmeriGas Propane; (2) UGI International; (3) Midstream & Marketing; and (4) Utilities.\nAmeriGas Propane derives its revenues principally from the sale of propane and related equipment and supplies to retail customers in all 50 states. UGI International derives its revenues principally from the distribution of LPG to retail customers throughout much of Europe. In addition, UGI International derives revenue from natural gas marketing businesses in France, Belgium and the United Kingdom and a natural gas and electricity marketing business in the Netherlands. See Note 25 for additional information regarding the October 2022 sale of the United Kingdom energy marketing business and the November 2022 announcement related to the France energy marketing business. Midstream & Marketing derives its revenues principally from the sale of natural gas, liquid fuels and electricity as well as revenues and fees from storage, pipeline transportation, natural gas gathering, natural gas and RNG production activities primarily in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. eastern Ohio, the panhandle of West Virginia and California. Midstream & Marketing also derives revenues from the sale of electricity through PJM, a regional electricity transmission organization in the eastern U.S., and, prior to its sale on September 30, 2020, also from contracting services provided by HVAC to customers in portions of eastern and central Pennsylvania (see Note 5). Our Utilities segment primarily derives its revenues from the sale and distribution of natural gas to customers in eastern and central Pennsylvania and subsequent to the Mountaineer Acquisition in September 2021, in West Virginia (see Note 5). To a much lesser extent, Utilities also derives revenues from the sale and distribution of electricity in two northeastern Pennsylvania counties.\nCorporate & Other includes certain items that are excluded from our CODMs assessment of segment performance (see below for further details on these items). Corporate & Other also includes the net expenses of UGIs captive general liability insurance company, UGIs corporate headquarters facility and UGIs unallocated corporate and general expenses as well as interest expense on UGI debt that is not allocated. Corporate & Other assets principally comprise cash and cash equivalents of UGI and its captive insurance company, and UGI corporate headquarters assets.\nThe accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 2. Our CODM evaluates the performance of all of our reportable segments based upon earnings before interest expense and income taxes, excluding the items noted below.\nNo single customer represents more than ten percent of our consolidated revenues. In addition, all of our reportable segments revenues, other than those of UGI International, are derived from sources within the United States, and all of our reportable segments long-lived assets, other than those of UGI International, are located in the United States.

Beginning in Fiscal 2019, we began executing on multi-year business transformation initiatives at our AmeriGas Propane and UGI International business segments. These initiatives are designed to improve long-\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nterm operational performance by, among other things, reducing costs and improving efficiency in the areas of sales and marketing, supply and logistics, operations, purchasing, and administration. In addition, these business transformation initiatives focus on enhancing the customer experience through, among other things, enhanced customer relationship management and an improved digital customer experience. During Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 we incurred $87 and $62 respectively, of costs principally comprising consulting, advisory, marketing and employee-related costs. These costs are primarily reflected in Operating and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. These previously announced business transformation initiatives were substantially complete by the end of Fiscal 2021.\nCorporate Services. Beginning in Fiscal 2020, we initiated a transformation project focused on our support functions including: finance, procurement, human resources, and information technology. This initiative will standardize processes and activities across our global platform, while leveraging the use of best practices and efficiencies between our businesses. In connection with this initiative, during Fiscal 2022 and 2021, we incurred $9 and $14, respectively. Amounts in connection with this initiative are reflected in Operating and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nNote 25 - Subsequent Events\nDispositions\nUGI International United Kingdom Energy Marketing. In October 2022, UGI International, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, sold its natural gas marketing business located in the United Kingdom resulting in a net cash payment to the buyer of $19 which includes working capital adjustments. The assets and liabilities associated with this business, primarily attributable to the value of unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts, are classified as held-for-sale on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2022. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022, the Company recognized an impairment charge, which was limited to the disposal groups long-lived assets in accordance with its policy related to assets held for sale. Such impairment in Fiscal 2022 was not material. An incremental pretax loss of approximately $220 was recognized in the first quarter of Fiscal 2023 in connection with the completed sale, largely attributable to the difference between the net cash payment to the buyer and the fair value of net derivative assets sold along with customer contracts as of the transaction date. The change in the net assets held for sale as of September 30, 2022, and the loss recognized upon disposal in October 2022, was due to the change in the fair value of the net derivative assets subsequent to September 30, 2022.\nUGI International France Energy Marketing. In November 2022, the Company announced its intent to sell its energy marketing business located in France, with a definitive agreement expected to be signed in the first quarter of Fiscal 2023. The Company expects to recognize a significant loss on the sale largely attributable to the value of net derivative assets sold along with the related customer contracts. At September 30, 2022, the carrying value of the net assets of the Companys energy marketing business in France amounted to approximately $470 with primarily all of that value related to the fair value of the applicable derivative contracts.\nUGI CORPORATION\nSCHEDULE I - CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF REGISTRANT (PARENT COMPANY)\nBALANCE SHEETS\n(Millions of dollars)\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 20 $ 14\nAccounts receivable - related parties 24 18\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 20 11\nTotal current assets 64 43\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 1 2\nInvestments in subsidiaries 7,035 6,479\nOther assets 97 107\nTotal assets $ 7,197 $ 6,631\nLIABILITIES AND COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt $ 125 $ 70\nAccounts and notes payable 20 24\nAccrued liabilities 51 62\nTotal current liabilities 196 156\nLong-term debt 889 875\nOther noncurrent liabilities 46 78\nTotal liabilities 1,131 1,109\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 1)\nEquity:\nPreferred Stock, without par value (authorized - 5,000,000; issued - 220,000 and 220,000, respectively)\n162 213\nCommon Stock, without par value (authorized - 450,000,000 shares; issued - 210,560,494 and 209,843,296 shares, respectively)\n1,483 1,394\nRetained earnings 4,841 4,081\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (380) (140)\nTreasury stock, at cost (40) (26)\nTotal common stockholders equity 6,066 5,522\nTotal liabilities and common stockholders equity $ 7,197 $ 6,631\nNote 1 - Commitments and Contingencies:\nAt September 30, 2022, UGI Corporation had agreed to indemnify the issuers of $107 of surety bonds issued on behalf of certain UGI subsidiaries.
