    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nCEL-SCI Corporation (CEL-SCI) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on finding the best way to activate the immune system to fight cancer and infectious diseases. Its lead investigational therapy Multikine\u00ae (Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection) completed a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for patients who are newly diagnosed with locally advanced (stage III and IV) primary (not yet treated) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Multikine has received Orphan Drug Status from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA) for this indication. The study is believed to be the biggest Phase 3 head and neck cancer study ever with 928 patients and lasted almost 10 years. This trial was under the management of two clinical research organizations(CROs): ICON plc.(ICON) and Ergomed Clinical Research Limited (Ergomed).\nOn June 28, 2021, the Company announced top line results from its pivotal Phase 3 study for Multikine. The Phase 3 results showed a long-term 5-year overall survival (OS) benefit in the treatment arm that received Multikine treatment followed by surgery and radiation (the lower risk to recurrence treatment arm). This survival benefit was robust and durable and added no toxicity to the overall treatment, something not commonly seen with cancer drugs. In fact, the survival benefit increased over time and at 5-years the overall survival benefit reached an absolute 14.1% advantage for the Multikine treated arm over control (n=380, total study patients treated with surgery plus radiation), control arm 48.6%, Multikine arm 62.7% survival.\nThe study used the standard of care treatment for advanced primary head and neck cancer patients as a comparison. The patients received surgery followed by either radiation or chemoradiation (chemotherapy and radiation at the same time), as determined by the physician. This means that there were 2 treatment arms, 1) surgery plus radiation or 2) surgery plus chemoradiation. The arm that received Multikine treatment followed by surgery and radiation showed great survival benefit, but when chemotherapy was added in the second treatment arm, the immunological effect of Multikine was negated. Therefore, when the two treatment arms were combined the study did not achieve its primary endpoint of a 10% improvement in overall survival.\nHowever, the analysis of the separate treatment arms was prespecified in the protocol and carried out prior to the Company becoming unblinded. The OS benefit of 14.1% at 5 years for this treatment arm exceeded the 10% OS benefit set out for the study population as a whole. The OS results for this treatment arm are significant (two-sided p=0.0236, HR=0.68) and the effect is robust, durable and increasing over time. In addition, the study had a significant number of patients who had partial and even complete tumor responses following the 3-week treatment with Multikine. Most of those were among the patients who did not receive chemotherapy. It was also discovered that patients who have tumor burden reductions (early tumor responders) have significantly improved survival. The results from the Phase 3 cancer study proved that Multikine met all of the protocol required benefits stated in the study protocol in patients in the treatment arm receiving surgery and radiation as their standard therapies. The Company will be filing for and seeking FDA approval for the use of Multikine in the treatment of advanced primary head and neck cancer in this patient population of about 210,000 patients annually worldwide.\nCEL-SCIs investigational immunotherapy Multikine is being used in a different way than cancer immunotherapy is usually used. It is given before any other therapy has been administered because that is when the immune system is thought to be strongest (as a neoadjuvant). It is also administered locally around the tumors and near the draining lymph node. In the Phase 3 clinical trial, Multikine was given locally for three weeks, five days per week as a first line treatment before surgery, radiation or radiochemotherapy. The goal is to help the intact immune system see the cancer and kill the micro metastases that usually cause recurrence of the cancer. In short, CEL-SCI believes that local administration and administration of Multikine before weakening of the immune system by surgery and radiation will result in improved outcomes and better overall survival rates for patients suffering from head and neck cancer.\nCEL-SCI is also investigating a peptide-based immunotherapy (CEL-4000) as a vaccine for rheumatoid arthritis using its LEAPS technology platform.\nCEL-SCI was formed as a Colorado corporation in 1983. CEL-SCIs principal office is located at 8229 Boone Boulevard, Suite 802, Vienna, VA 22182. CEL-SCIs telephone number is 703-506-9460 and its website is www.cel-sci.com. CEL-SCI does not incorporate the information on its website into this report, and you should not consider it part of this report.\nCEL-SCI makes its electronic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports. These filings are available on its website free of charge as soon as practicable after they are filed or furnished to the SEC.\nCEL-SCIS PRODUCTS\nCEL-SCI is a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to research and development directed at improving the treatment of cancer and other diseases by using the immune system, the bodys natural defense system. CEL-SCI is currently focused on the development of the following product candidates and technologies:\n1)\nMultikine, an investigational immunotherapy under development for the potential treatment of certain head and neck cancers;\n2)\nL.E.A.P.S. (Ligand Epitope Antigen Presentation System) technology, or LEAPS, with a product candidate CEL-4000, under development for the potential treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.\nNone of CEL-SCIs product candidates have been approved for sale, barter or exchange by the FDA or any other regulatory agency for any use to treat disease in humans nor has the safety or efficacy of these products been established for any use. There can be no assurance that obtaining marketing approval from the FDA in the United States and by comparable agencies in most foreign countries will be granted.\nMULTIKINE\nCEL-SCIs lead investigational therapy, Multikine, is currently being developed as a potential therapeutic agent directed at using the immune system to produce an anti-tumor immune response. Data from Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials suggest that Multikine may help the immune system see the tumor and then attack it, enabling the bodys own anti-tumor immune response to fight the tumor. Multikine is the trademark that CEL-SCI has registered for this investigational therapy, and this proprietary name is subject to review by the FDA, in connection with CEL-SCIs future anticipated regulatory submission for approval in the United States. Multikine has not been licensed or approved for sale, barter or exchange by the FDA or any other regulatory agency, such as the European Medicine Agency(EMA), and neither its safety nor its efficacy been established.\nMultikine is an immunotherapy product candidate comprised of a patented defined mixture of 14 human natural cytokines. If commercial approval is obtained, CEL-SCI intends to manufacture Multikine in a proprietary manner in CEL-SCIs manufacturing facility near Baltimore, Maryland, USA. CEL-SCI spent over 10 years and more than $100 million developing and validating the manufacturing process for Multikine. The pro-inflammatory cytokine mixture includes interleukins, interferons, chemokines and colony-stimulating factors, which contain elements of the bodys natural mix of defenses against cancer.\nMultikine is designed to be used in a different way than cancer immunotherapy is generally being used. Generally, cancer immunotherapy is given to patients who have already failed other treatments such as surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy and most of the time it is administered systemically. Multikine on the other hand is administered locally to treat tumors and their microenvironment before any other therapy has been administered because it is believed that this is the time when the immune system would be strongest and most amenable to activation against the tumor. For example, in the Phase 3 clinical trial, Multikine was injected locally around the tumor and near the adjacent draining lymph nodes for three weeks, five days a week as a first treatment before surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. The goal is to help the intact immune system recognize and kill the tumor micro metastases that usually cause recurrence of the cancer. In short, CEL-SCI believes that the local administration of Multikine before weakening of the immune system by surgery, chemotherapy and radiation will result in better anti-tumor response than if Multikine were administered after surgery and radiation. In clinical studies of Multikine, administration of the investigational therapy to head and neck cancer patients has demonstrated the potential for lesser or no appreciable toxicity.\nSource: Adapted from Timar et al., Journal of Clinical Oncology 23(15) May 20, 2005\nThe first indication CEL-SCI is pursuing for its investigational drug product candidate Multikine is an indication for the neoadjuvant therapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or SCCHN (hereafter also referred to as advanced primary head and neck cancer).\nOn May 27, 2022, CEL-SCI announced the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published two abstracts related to its pivotal Phase 3 Multikine head and neck cancer clinical trial. The poster was presented by CEL-SCIs Chief Scientific Officer, Eyal Talor, Ph.D. at the 2022 ASCO Annual Meeting on June 6, 2022 in Chicago, Illinois. The abstract titles and corresponding links are as follows:\n\u00b7\nLeukocyte interleukin injection (LI) immunotherapy extends overall survival (OS) in treatment-naive low-risk (LR) locally advanced primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: The IT-MATTERS study.\no\nLink to abstract: https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/207201\no\nLink to poster: https://cel-sci.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/CEL-SCI-ASCO-2022-Poster-6032-June-6-Head-and-Neck-Cancer-1.pdf\n\u00b7\nNovel algorithm for assigning risk/disease-directed treatment (DDT) choice in locally advanced primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN): Using pretreatment data only.\no\nLink to abstract: https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/207202/\nAt ASCO 2022, CEL-SCI presented data that showed the following:\n\u00b7\n14.1% absolute advantage in overall survival (OS) at 5-years in the lower-risk-for-recurrence treatment arm (62.7% vs 48.6%) of patients with previously untreated locally advanced primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (Multikine+CIZ) versus the standard of care (SOC) control patients. Patients in the lower-risk-for-recurrence treatment arm are those with no adverse features discovered during surgery and who are therefore supposed to receive radiotherapy only after surgery. However, lower-risk does not mean low risk, as this treatment arm without CEL-SCIs investigational Multikine still saw less than 50% survival 5-years post standard of care treatment alone (control group).\n\u00b7\nNearly 4-year increase in median survival in this treatment arm (101.7 months for Multikine+CIZ versus 55.2 months for the SOC alone).\n\u00b7\nObjective response before surgery (partial and complete tumor responses):\no\nIn 8.5% (45/529) of Multikine-treated patients in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (n=923) versus zero in the SOC alone (control).\no\nIn 16.0% (34/212) of Multikine-treated patients in this treatment arm (n=380) versus zero in the SOC alone (control).\n\u00b7\nComplete tumor response before surgery in five of the early responders, all five of which were in the Multikine+CIZ treatment arm.\n\u00b7\nObjective responses before surgery were prognostic for improved survival and significant for reduced death rate:\no\nIn the overall ITT population, 22.2% death rate (n=45) among objective responders before surgery versus 54.1% death rate for the Multikine non-responders (n=484).\no\nIn the Proposed Indication, 17.6% death rate (n=34) among objective responders before surgery versus 42.7% death rate for the Multikine non-responders (n=178).\n\u00b7\nHistopathological analysis confirmed the effect of Multikine, as 61 markers, ratios, and combinations showed a statistically significant effect (two-sided p<0.05) favoring the Multikine+CIZ treatment arm versus the SOC alone (control) for OS, Progression Free Survival (PFS), and Locoregional Control (LRC) outcomes.\n\u00b7\nAdditional (confirmatory) progression-free survival (PFS) benefit in the Proposed Indication was observed for Multikine+CIZ versus the SOC alone.\n\u00b7\nPre-specified analysis of the Proposed Indication was noted and discussed in the original study protocol and pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan. The Proposed Indication comprised about 40% of all study participants.\n\u00b7\nThe overall incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events in the Multikine arms was not substantially different versus the SOC alone.\nCEL-SCI also presented a selection process (algorithm) that allows physicians to select before surgery those patients who are intended to receive only radiotherapy after surgery.\nOn September 12, 2022, CEL-SCI announced two poster presentations were delivered at the European Society for Medical Oncology (EMSO) annual Congress. Data presented were from CEL-SCIs pivotal Phase 3 study and summarized below:\nPoster Presentation: Early response to Neoadjuvant Leukocyte Interleukin Injection (LI) immunotherapy extends overall survival (OS) in locally advanced primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head & neck (HN): the IT-MATTERS Study\n\u00b7\nEarly tumor response (early response) to neoadjuvant Multikine-Treatment is noted before surgery (occurring at median 5 weeks post-randomization) adding credibility to the isolated impact of early treatment\n\u00b7\nEarly response provides a positive signal to both patients and care providers (early in the treatment course)\n\u00b7\nEarly response was noted only in the Multikine* (Leukocyte Interleukin Injection) treatment groups and not in the control group\n\u00b7\nEarly response occurs in both the Lower Risk and Higher Risk groups for recurrence (Risk as defined per NCCN Guidelines)\n\u00b7\nEarly response is prognostic and predictive for overall survival in:\n\u00b7\nThe overall population; and\n\u00b7\nThe Lower Risk population\n\u00b7\nBenefit was also seen in Multikine-treated Lower Risk non-responders\n\u00b7\nLink to poster: https://cel-sci.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/CEL-SCI-ESMO-690P-Early-Responders-Poster-FINAL.pdf\n\u00b7\nLink to video presentation: https://youtu.be/zMoFtweVGzs\nPoster Presentation: Histopathology (HP) biomarkers confirm Leukocyte Interleukin Injection (LI) treatment (Tx) outcome in na\u00efve locally advanced primary head & neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCCHN) the IT-MATTERS Study\n\u00b7\nPre-defined markers, ratios, and combinations derived from Multikine treated tumor samples at surgery contribute to Multikine efficacy for all three efficacy endpoints (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and local regional control (LRC)\n\u00b7\nBroad representation of markers, ratios, and combinations overall and for Lower Risk (LR) for the OS, PFS, LRC efficacy study endpoints\n\u00b7\nThere were 61 (21.9%) favorable overall and 54 (19.4%) favorable Lower Risk treatment group outcomes (much beyond 2.5% chance) and only a total of five instances (1.9%) [all High Risk] having unfavorable treatment group outcome (within the realm of chance)\n\u00b7\nThese biomarkers were prognostic for superior efficacy of the post-surgery adjuvant radiotherapy as compared to adjuvant chemoradiotherapy\n\u00b7\nThe results support the Lower Risk treatment advantage (0.68 HR, Wald p<0.05) significantly favoring Multikine+CIZ+ SOC vs SOC alone\n\u00b7\nLink to poster: https://cel-sci.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/CEL-SCI-ESMO-128P-HP-Poster-FINAL.pdf\nThe study used the standard of care treatment for advanced primary head and neck cancer patients as a comparison. The patients received surgery followed by either radiation or chemoradiation (chemotherapy and radiation at the same time), as determined by the physician based on pathology from surgery. This means that there were 2 distinctly different treatment arms, 1) surgery plus radiation or 2) surgery plus chemoradiation. The arm that received Multikine treatment followed by surgery and radiation showed great survival benefit, but when chemotherapy was added in the second treatment arm, the immunological effect of Multikine was negated. Therefore, when the two treatment arms were combined the study did not achieve its primary endpoint of a 10% improvement in overall survival.\nHowever, the analysis of the separate treatment arms was prespecified in the protocol and carried out prior to the Company becoming unblinded. The OS benefit of 14.1% at 5 years for this treatment arm exceeded the 10% OS benefit set out for the study population as a whole. The OS results for this treatment arm are significant (two-sided p=0.0236, HR=0.68) and the effect is robust, durable and increasing over time. The results from the Phase 3 cancer study proved that Multikine met all of the protocol required benefits stated in the study protocol in patients in the treatment arm receiving surgery and radiation as their standard therapies.\nCEL-SCI also presented data at the ESMO cancer meeting in September 2022. Particularly important is the early tumor response (ER) seen as a direct result of the 3-week Multikine treatment. LR means lower risk for recurrence which is scheduled to be treated with surgery and radiotherapy, HR means higher risk for recurrence which is scheduled to be treated with surgery followed by radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy. MK means Multikine. OS means Overall Survival.\nThere were 45 objective Early Tumor Responses (5 complete and 40 partial responders) and 462 deaths (50.1%); the 5 complete responders [CRs] were all confirmed by pathology. ERs were only observed in the two Multikine-treated groups (8.5% combined MK; 16% LR combined MK vs 3.7% HR MK; 15.2% LR MK+CIZ+SOC). ERs were more commonly seen in the LR group (16.0%) vs the HR group (3.7%). No responders were seen in the SOC patients. In the MK-treated groups, death rates fell significantly for ERs vs non-responders (54.1% vs 22.2% combined MK; 42.5% vs 17.6% LR combined MK groups; 40.7% vs 12.5% LR (MK+CIZ+SOC); the corresponding hazard ratios (HZR) were 0.301 (Wald p<0.0001) overall, 0.348 (p=0.0067) for LR MK, and 0.246 (p=0.01) for LR MK=CIZ=SO in support of ER being supportive.\nAssuming no OS prolongation for the remaining 84.8%, this equates to a 46.5% OS gain corresponding to the observed 0.68 HZR (1/1.465) for the ITT Lower Risk LI (MK)+CIZ+SOC group; this was consistent with the observed 46.5-month median OS advantage for LR LI+CIZ+SOC (101.7 months) vs LR SOC (55.2 months). ER was also predictive; among the 45 responders; there were only 10 deaths (22.2%) in contrast to 452 (51.5%) for the overall ITT population. Thus, ER was predictive from both a modeling and outcome perspective. The conclusions were as follows: Objective ER was only observed for the MK treatments. Multiple ERs were observed across LR (n=34), HR (n=10), and UC (n=1). ER from MK treatment is not only prognostic but also predicts a most favorable OS outcome.\nSince CEL-SCI launched its Phase 3 clinical trial for Multikine, CEL-SCI has incurred expenses of approximately $64.1 million as of September 30, 2022 on direct costs for the Phase 3 clinical trial. CEL-SCI estimates it will incur additional expenses of approximately $0.6 million for the remainder of the Phase 3 clinical trial and the filing of the clinical study report to the FDA. It should be noted that this estimate is based only on the information currently available from the CROs responsible for managing the Phase 3 clinical trial and does not include other related costs, e.g., preparations for the potential commercial manufacture of the drug.\nUltimately, the decision as to whether CEL-SCIs drug product candidate is safe and effective can only be made by the FDA and/or by other regulatory authorities based upon an assessment of all of the data from an entire drug development program submitted as part of an application for marketing approval. As detailed in the Risk Factors section of this report, the current Phase 3 clinical study for CEL-SCIs investigational drug may or may not be able to be used as the pivotal study supporting a marketing application in the United States, and, if not, at least one entirely new Phase 3 pivotal study would need to be conducted to support a marketing application in the United States. However, CEL-SCI does not believe that this would be ethical or supported by the survival data for this unmet medical need.\nDevelopment Agreements for Multikine\nIn August 2008, CEL-SCI signed an agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., or Teva, that gives Teva the exclusive right and license to market, distribute and sell Multikine, if approved, in Israel and Turkey for treatment of head and neck cancer. The agreement terminates on a country-by-country basis 10 years after the product launch in each country or upon a material breach or upon bankruptcy of either party. The agreement will automatically extend for additional two-year terms unless either party gives notice of its intent not to extend the agreement. If CEL-SCI develops Multikine for other oncology indications and Teva indicates a desire to participate, the parties have agreed to negotiate in good faith with respect to Tevas participation and contribution in future clinical trials.\nTeva has agreed to use all reasonable efforts to obtain regulatory approval to market and sell Multikine in its territory at its own cost and expense. Pursuant to the agreement, it is CEL-SCIs responsibility to supply Multikine and Tevas responsibility to sell Multikine, if approved by regulatory authorities in the relevant countries. Net sales will be divided 50/50 between the two parties. Teva also initially agreed to fund certain activities relating to the conduct of a clinical trial in Israel as part of the global Phase 3 trial for Multikine. In January 2012, pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement between CEL-SCI, Teva and GCP Clinical Studies Ltd., or GCP, Teva transferred all of its rights and obligations concerning the Phase 3 trial in Israel to GCP.\nIn July 2011, Serbia and Croatia were added to Tevas territory, pursuant to a joinder agreement between CEL-SCI and PLIVA Hrvatska d.o.o., or PLIVA, an affiliate of Tevas, subject to similar terms as described above.\nIn consideration for the rights granted by CEL-SCI to PLIVA under the joinder agreement, CEL-SCI will be paid by PLIVA (in U.S. dollars):\n\u00b7\n$100,000 upon EMA grant of Marketing Authorization for Multikine;\n\u00b7\n$50,000 upon Croatias grant of reimbursement status for Multikine in Croatia; and\n\u00b7\n$50,000 upon Serbias grant of reimbursement status for Multikine in Serbia.\nIn November 2000, CEL-SCI signed an agreement with Orient Europharma Co., Ltd., or Orient Europharma, of Taiwan, which was amended in October 2008 and again in June 2010. Pursuant to this agreement, as amended, Orient Europharma has the exclusive marketing and distribution rights to Multikine, if approved by regulatory authorities, for head and neck cancer, naso-pharyngeal cancer and potentially cervical cancer indications in Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, the Philippines, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. CEL-SCI has granted Orient Europharma the first right of negotiation with respect to Thailand and China.\nThe agreement requires Orient Europharma to fund 10% of the cost of the clinical trials needed to obtain marketing approvals in these countries for head and neck cancer, naso-pharyngeal cancer and potentially cervical cancer.\nIf Multikine is approved for sale, Orient Europharma will purchase Multikine from CEL-SCI for 35% of the gross selling price in each country.Orient Europharma is obligated to use the same diligent efforts to develop, register, market, sell and distribute Multikine in its territory as with its own products or other licensed products.\nThe agreement will terminate on a country-by-country basis 15 years after the product approval for Multikine in each country, at which point the agreement will be automatically extended for successive two year periods, unless either party gives notice of its intent not to extend the agreement. The agreement may also be terminated upon the bankruptcy of either party or material misrepresentations that are not cured within 60 days. If the agreement ends before the 15-year term through no fault of either party, CEL-SCI will reimburse Orient Europharma for a prorated part of Orient Europhormas costs towards the clinical trials of Multikine. If Orient Europharma fails to make certain minimum purchases of Multikine during the term of the agreement, Orient Europhormas rights to the territory will become non-exclusive.\nCEL-SCI has a licensing agreement with Byron Biopharma LLC (Byron) under which CEL-SCI granted Byron an exclusive license to market and distribute Multikine in the Republic of South Africa, if approved. This license will terminate 20 years after marketing approval in South Africa or after the bankruptcy or uncured material breach by either party. After the 20-year period has expired, the agreement will be automatically extended for successive two-year periods, unless either party gives notice of its intent not to extend the agreement.\nPursuant to the agreement, Byron will be responsible for registering Multikine in South Africa. If Multikine is approved for sale in South Africa, CEL-SCI will be responsible for manufacturing the product, while Byron will be responsible for sales in South Africa. Sales revenues will be divided equally between CEL-SCI and Byron.\nLEAPS\nCEL-SCIs patented T-cell Modulation Process, referred to as LEAPS (Ligand Epitope Antigen Presentation System), uses heteroconjugates to direct the body to choose a specific immune response. LEAPS is designed to stimulate the human immune system to more effectively fight bacterial, viral and parasitic infections as well as autoimmune conditions, allergies, transplantation rejection and cancer, when it cannot do so on its own. LEAPS combines T-cell binding ligands with small, disease associated, peptide antigens and may provide a new method to treat and prevent certain diseases.\nThe ability to generate a specific immune response is important because many diseases are often not combated effectively due to the bodys selection of the inappropriate immune response. The capability to specifically reprogram an immune response may offer a more effective approach than existing vaccines and drugs in attacking an underlying disease.\nLEAPS Candidates: CEL-2000, CEL-4000 and DerG-PG275(Cit)\nOn September 19, 2017, CEL-SCI announced that it had been awarded a Phase 2 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant in the amount of $1.5 million from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases(NIAMS), which is part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). This grant provided funding to allow CEL-SCI to advance its first LEAPS product candidate, CEL-4000, towards an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for a Phase 1 safety study, by funding IND enabling studies and additional mechanism of action studies, among other preclinical development activities. Work on CEL-4000 was conducted at CEL-SCIs research laboratory and Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois in the laboratories of Tibor Glant, MD, Ph.D., Jorge O. Galante Professor of Orthopedic Surgery and Katalin Mikecz, MD, Ph.D. Professor of Orthopedic Surgery & Biochemistry. The SBIR grant was awarded based on published data described below by Dr. Glant's team in collaboration with CEL-SCI showing that the administration of a proprietary peptide using CEL-SCI's LEAPS technology prevented the development, and lessened the severity, including inflammation, of experimental proteoglycan induced arthritis (PGIA or GIA) when it was administered after the disease was induced in animals. This grant has been fully expended.\nIn May 2019, CEL-SCI announced that a newly discovered LEAPS conjugate acts alone and can complement CEL-4000 therapeutically when administered in combination to an animal model of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). This new LEAPS conjugate appears to act on T cell pathways by a new mechanism that is different from the pathways used by the CEL-4000 vaccine. The data was presented at the American Association of Immunologists 103rd Annual Meeting (Immunology 2019) by Daniel Zimmerman, Ph.D., CEL-SCIs Senior Vice President of Research, Cellular Immunology. The work was performed in conjunction with researchers at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois and was funded by the SBIR Phase 2 Grant.\nIn July 2019, one of CEL-SCIs collaborators from Rush, Dr. Adrienn Markovics, presented new LEAPS data at i-Chem2019, International Conference on Immunity and Immunochemistry. Data presented was for a new second RA conjugate discovered which acts alone and can complement the existing CEL-4000 RA vaccine in an animal model of RA. The combination of the two RA conjugates provided not only broader epitope coverage, but also a greater therapeutic effect than either conjugate alone. The LEAPS work was performed in conjunction with researchers at CEL-SCI on CEL-4000 and a newly discovered LEAPS conjugate, DerG-PG275Cit. Both conjugates were evaluated alone and in combination in the model of proteoglycan (PG) induced arthritis (PGIA) called recombinant PG G1 domain-induced arthritis (GIA), an autoimmune mouse model of RA.\nIn February 2017 and November 2016, CEL-SCI announced preclinical data that demonstrate its investigational new drug candidate CEL-4000 has the potential to treat rheumatoid arthritis. This study was supported in part by the SBIR Phase I Grant and was conducted in collaboration with Drs. Katalin Mikecz and Tibor Glant, and their research team at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, IL. This work was published in an article entitled An epitope-specific DerG-PG70 LEAPS vaccine modulates T cell responses and suppresses arthritis progression in two related murine models of rheumatoid arthritis and can be found online at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5568759/.\nPrior to the SBIR Phase 2 grant in 2014, CEL-SCI was awarded a Phase 1 SBIR grant in the amount of $225,000 from NIAMS. This grant funded the development of CEL-SCIs LEAPS technology as a potential treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease of the joints. The work was conducted at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois in the laboratories of Tibor Glant, MD, Ph.D., Katalin Mikecz, MD, Ph.D., and Allison Finnegan, Ph.D. Professor of Medicine.\nWith the support of these SBIR grants, CEL-SCI is developing several new drug candidates, CEL-2000 and CEL-4000, as potential rheumatoid arthritis therapeutic treatments. The data from animal studies using the CEL-2000 treatment suggests that it could be used against rheumatoid arthritis with fewer administrations than those required by other anti-rheumatoid arthritis treatments currently on the market for arthritic conditions associated with the Th17 signature cytokine TNF-a. The preclinical data indicates these peptides could be used against rheumatoid arthritis where a Th1 signature cytokine (IFN-\u03b3) is dominant. CEL-2000 and CEL-4000 each have the potential to become a personalized, disease-specific therapy that acts at an earlier step in the disease process than current therapies, and which may be useful in patients not responding to existing rheumatoid arthritis therapies. CEL-SCI believes this represents a large unmet medical need in the rheumatoid arthritis market.\nIn March 2015, CEL-SCI and its collaborators published a review article on vaccine therapies for rheumatoid arthritis based in part on work supported by the SBIR Phase 1 grant. The article is entitled Rheumatoid arthritis vaccine therapies: perspectives and lessons from therapeutic Ligand Epitope Antigen Presentation System vaccines for models of rheumatoid arthritis and was published in Expert Review of Vaccines 1 - 18 and can be found online at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25787143.\nAccordingly, even though the various LEAPS candidates have not yet been given to humans, they have been tested in vitro with human cells. They have induced similar cytokine responses that were seen in these animal models, which may indicate that the LEAPS technology might translate to humans. The LEAPS candidates have demonstrated protection against lethal herpes simplex virus (HSV1) and H1N1 influenza infection as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent in animals. They have also shown some level of activity in animals in two autoimmune conditions, curtailing and sometimes preventing disease progression in arthritis and myocarditis animal models.\nNone of the LEAPS investigational products have been approved for sale, barter or exchange by the FDA or any other regulatory agency for any use to treat disease in animals or humans. The safety or efficacy of these products has not been established for any use. Lastly, no definitive conclusions can be drawn from the early-phase, preclinical-trials data involving these investigational products. Before obtaining marketing approval from the FDA in the United States, and by comparable agencies in most foreign countries, these product candidates must undergo rigorous preclinical and clinical testing which is costly and time consuming and subject to unanticipated delays. There can be no assurance that these approvals will be granted.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nPatents and other proprietary rights are essential to CEL-SCIs business. CEL-SCI files patent applications to protect its technologies, inventions and improvements that CEL-SCI considers important to the development of its business. CEL-SCIS intellectual property portfolio covers its proprietary technologies, including Multikine and LEAPS, by multiple issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and in key foreign markets.\nMultikine is protected by a U.S. patent, which is a composition-of-matter patent issued in May 2005 that, in its current format, expires in 2023. Additional composition-of-matter patents for Multikine have been issued in Germany (issued in June 2011 and currently set to expire in 2025), China (issued in May 2011 and currently set to expire in 2024), Japan (issued in November 2012 and currently set to expire in 2025), and three in Europe (issued in September 2015, May 2016 and October 2017, currently set to expire in 2025 and 2026). The most recent patent issued in October 2017, patent # EP 1 879 618 B1, titled A Method for Modulating HLA Class II Tumor Cell Surface Expression With A Cytokine Mixture, addresses Multikines mechanism of action to make tumors more visible to the immune system. This new patent is important because, along with the other Multikine issued patents, it addresses how Multikine enables the immune system to recognize and attack the tumor. One way tumor cells evade the immune system is by expressing human leukocyte antigens (HLA) on the tumor cell surface, thus appearing as \u2018self to the immune cells and therefore the tumor cells are not attacked. It is important to note that the tumors of the Multikine-treated best responders in CEL-SCIs prior Phase 2 studies had no HLA Class II expressed on the cell surface following Multikine treatment as compared to controls. This points to Multikines ability to modulate HLA expression on the tumor cell surface, thereby allowing the immune system to recognize and attack the tumor.\nIn addition to the patents that offer certain protections for Multikine, the method of manufacture for Multikine, a complex biological product, is held by CEL-SCI as a trade secret. CEL-SCI considers this to be its best protection from competitors.\nLEAPS is protected by patents in the United States issued between January 2019 and June 2021. The LEAPS patents, which expire between 2027 and 2032, include overlapping claims, with composition of both matter (new chemical entity), process and methods-of-use, to maximize and extend the coverage in their current format. One issued U.S. application is a joint application with Northeast Ohio Medical University (Neoucom) and CEL-SCI will share the ability to use the patent, unless CEL-SCI licenses the rights to the patent from Neoucom. In October 2017 and October 2020, patents were issued in Europe for LEAPS, which expire in 2029 and 2034, respectively.\nCEL-SCI has five patent applications pending in the United States for LEAPS, which, if issued, would extend protection through 2040, subject to any potential patent term extensions.\nAs of December 27, 2022, there were no contested proceedings and/or third-party claims with respect to CEL-SCIs patents or patent applications.\nMANUFACTURING FACILITY\nBefore starting the Phase 3 clinical trial, for reasons related to regulatory considerations, CEL-SCI built a dedicated manufacturing facility to produce its investigational biological product candidate Multikine. This facility produced multiple clinical lots for the Phase 3 clinical trial and has also passed quality systems review by a European Union Qualified Person on several occasions. CEL-SCI expanded the manufacturing facility so CEL-SCI will be able to meet the expected demand for Multikine, if FDA approval is granted. This expansion was completed at the end of 2021, allowing CEL-SCI employees to return to work inside the manufacturing facility. The facility is currently undergoing validation.\nCEL-SCIs lease on the manufacturing facility expires on October 31, 2028. At that time CEL-SCI can either purchase the facility or extend its lease. See Item 2 of this report for more information concerning the terms of this lease.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nThe FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels and in foreign countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing and post-approval monitoring and reporting of biologics such as those CEL-SCI is developing. CEL-SCI, along with third party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which it wishes to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of its product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation of Biological Products\nIn the United States, the FDA regulates biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before biological product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:\n\u00b7\ncompletion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDAs Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations;\n\u00b7\nsubmission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;\n\u00b7\napproval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is initiated;\n\u00b7\nperformance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;\n\u00b7\npreparation of and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (BLA) after completion of clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nsatisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;\n\u00b7\na determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;\n\u00b7\nsatisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological products continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigations to assess compliance with GCPs; and\n\u00b7\nFDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.\nPrior to commencing the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the U.S., CEL-SCI must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.\nClinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial commences at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board (DSMB) or independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), which provides recommendations for whether or not a study should move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may suggest halting the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.\nFor purposes of approval of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three or four sequential phases that may overlap.\n\u25cf Phase 1 - The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans and the side effects associated with increasing doses.\n\u25cf Phase 2 - The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.\n\u25cf Phase 3 - The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.\n\u25cf Phase 4 - In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. The FDA may also make these so-called Phase 4 or post-marketing studies a condition to approval of the BLA.\nPhase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.\nBLA Submission and Review by the FDA\nAssuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the products chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators.\nIn most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDAs goal is to review the BLA within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the product relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication and has received a priority review designation, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing.\nAfter filing the marketing application, the FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the products continued safety, purity and potency. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve a biological product for marketing unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the data provided in the application, or the manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities for the product are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. The FDA also may refer applications for novel biologic candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval.\nAfter the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the biological product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete but the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may request additional information or clarification, including new clinical studies. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the re-submitted BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.\nIf a product receives regulatory approval, such approval is limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population, indication) described in the application. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a products safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the biological product, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing trials or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.\nExpedited Review and Approval\nA sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDAs review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. For a fast track product, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant criteria are met. A fast track designated product candidate may also qualify for priority review.\nUnder the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the biologics clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established the new Breakthrough Therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Sponsors may request the FDA to designate a breakthrough therapy at the time of or any time after the submission of an IND, but ideally before an end-of-phase 2 meeting with the FDA. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller trials or more efficient trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment.\nFast Track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.\nPost-Approval Requirements\nAll therapeutic products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approval or licensure are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements under the PDUFA for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications containing clinical data. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements, which impose significant procedural and documentation requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements on manufacturers. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. CEL-SCI cannot be certain that it, or CEL-SCIs present or future suppliers, will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If CEL-SCI is not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may, among other things, take enforcement action or seek sanctions against use, impose restrictions on a product or its manufacturer, require CEL-SCI to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the BLA.\nThe FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;\n\u00b7\nfines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;\n\u00b7\nrefusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u00b7\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;\n\u00b7\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and\n\u00b7\nconsent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.\nThe FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drugs and biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of unapproved, or off-label, uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the products labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturers communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.\nOrphan Drug Designation\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States.\nIn the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market a drug for the same indication for a period of 7 years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of CEL-SCIs products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of a product before CEL-SCI does, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication CEL-SCI is seeking, or if CEL-SCIs product candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitors product for the same indication or disease. If one of CEL-SCIs products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.\nOrphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA to the FDA for review and approval. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.\nMultikine has received Orphan Drug Status from the FDA.\nOther U.S. Health Care Laws\nCEL-SCIs sales, promotion, medical education and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services and state and local governments. CEL-SCIs promotional and scientific/educational programs must comply with the anti-kickback provisions of the Social Security Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the False Claims Act, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, the Veterans Health Care Act and similar state laws.\nDepending on the circumstances, failure to meet these applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, exclusion from government health care programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers under the False Claims Act in the name of the government or refusal to allow CEL-SCI to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nCoverage, Pricing and Reimbursement in the U.S.\nSales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products and new drug classes, including biological products such as CEL-SCIs product candidates. CEL-SCI may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of its products. The product candidates that CEL-SCI develops may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive for CEL-SCI to seek reimbursement from third- party payors. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow CEL-SCI to sell its products on a competitive and profitable basis.\nThe United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect CEL-SCIs ability to sell its products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.\nForeign Regulation\nIn addition to regulations in the United States, CEL-SCI will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of its products to the extent CEL-SCI chooses to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.  ITEM 1B. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks described below could adversely affect the price of CEL-SCIs common stock.\nRisk Factor Summary\nCEL-SCI has incurred significant losses since its inception and anticipates that it will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nCEL-SCI will require substantial additional capital to remain in operation. A failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed could force CEL-SCI to delay, limit, reduce or terminate the product candidates development or commercialization efforts.\nThe costs of the product candidates development and clinical trials are difficult to estimate and will be very high for many years, preventing CEL-SCI from making a profit for the foreseeable future, if ever.\nCEL-SCI has not established a definite plan for the marketing of Multikine, if approved.\nCEL-SCI depends heavily on the success of Multikine, for which top line Phase 3 data has been announced, while its other candidates are still in preclinical phases. CEL-SCIs product candidates must undergo rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approvals, which could be costly and time-consuming and subject CEL-SCI to unanticipated delays or prevent CEL-SCI from marketing any products. If CEL-SCI is unable to advance its product candidates in clinical development, obtain regulatory approval and ultimately commercialize its product candidates, or experiences significant delays in doing so, CEL-SCIs business will be materially harmed.\nEven if CEL-SCI obtains regulatory approval for its investigational products, CEL-SCI will be subject to stringent, ongoing government regulation.\nCEL-SCIs product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial utility of an approved prescribing label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nBiologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on future results of CEL-SCIs operations.\nThe current and future relationships with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, potential customers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere may be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable healthcare laws and regulations.\nCEL-SCIs commercial success depends, in part, upon attaining significant market acceptance of its product candidates, if approved, among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and major operators of cancer clinics.\nCEL-SCIs patents might not protect its technology from competitors, in which case CEL-SCI may not have any advantage over competitors in selling any products that CEL-SCI may develop.\nMuch of CEL-SCIs intellectual property is protected as trade secrets or confidential know-how, not by patents.\nYou may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings or other equity issuances by CEL-SCI.\nThe price of CEL-SCIs common stock has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for CEL-SCIs shareholders.\nCEL-SCI faces business disruption and related risks resulting from the recent pandemic of COVID-19 which could have a material adverse effect on CEL-SCI's business plan.\nRisks Related to CEL-SCI\nCEL-SCI faces business disruption and related risks resulting from the recent pandemic of COVID-19 which could have a material adverse effect on our business plan.\nThe development of CEL-SCIs product candidates could be disrupted and materially adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. CEL-SCI knows that COVID delayed the time to reach data lock for its Phase 3 clinical trial, delayed the expansion of CEL-SCIs manufacturing facility for Multikine and could potentially affect the regulatory pathway for Multikine through the FDA and/or other regulatory agencies throughout the world. CEL-SCI is continually assessing its business plans and the impact COVID-19 may have on its ability to seek regulatory approval for Multikine and conduct the preclinical studies and clinical trials other than CEL-SCIs Phase 3 trial, but there can be no assurance that this analysis will enable CEL-SCI to avoid part or all of any impact from the spread of COVID-19 or its consequences, including downturns in business sentiment generally. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and global efforts to contain its spread will impact CEL-SCIs operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, and include the duration, severity and scope of the pandemic and the actions taken to contain or treat the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCEL-SCI has incurred significant losses since its inception and anticipates that it will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nCEL-SCI has a history of net losses, expects to incur substantial losses and have negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future, and may never achieve or maintain profitability. Since the date of its formation and through September 30, 2022, CEL-SCI incurred net losses of approximately $456 million. CEL-SCI has relied principally upon the proceeds from the public and private sales of its securities to finance its activities to date. To date, CEL-SCI has not commercialized any products or generated any revenue from the sale of products, and CEL-SCI does not expect to generate any product revenue for the foreseeable future. CEL-SCI does not know whether or when it will generate product revenue or become profitable.\nCEL-SCI is heavily dependent on the success of Multikine for which Phase 3 data has been announced and presented at ASCO 2022 and ESMO 2022. CEL-SCI cannot be certain that Multikine will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized even if CEL-SCI receives regulatory approval. Multikine is the only product candidate in late-stage clinical development and CEL-SCIs business currently depends heavily on its successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization. CEL-SCI has no drug products for sale currently and may never be able to develop approved and marketable drug products.\nEven if CEL-SCI succeeds in developing and commercializing one or more of its product candidates, CEL-SCI expects to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures as CEL-SCI:\n\u00b7\ncontinues to undertake preclinical development and clinical trials for product candidates;\n\u00b7\nseeks regulatory approvals for product candidates; and\n\u00b7\nimplements additional internal systems and infrastructure.\nTo become and remain profitable, CEL-SCI must succeed in developing and commercializing product candidates which must generate significant revenue. This will require CEL-SCI to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of its product candidates, discovering or acquiring additional product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling any products for which CEL-SCI may obtain regulatory approval. CEL-SCI is only in the preliminary stages of most of these activities. CEL-SCI may never succeed in these activities and, even if CEL-SCI does, may never generate revenue that is significant enough to achieve profitability.\nEven if CEL-SCI does achieve profitability, it may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. The failure to become and remain profitable could depress the value of CEL-SCIs common stock and could impair its ability to raise capital, expand its business, maintain research and development efforts, diversify product offerings or even continue in operation. A decline in the value of CEL-SCIs common stock could cause its stockholders to lose all or part of their investment.\nCEL-SCI has identified conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for more than twelve months from the date of these financial statements.\nPrimarily as a result of CEL-SCIs losses incurred to date, CEL-SCIs expected continued future losses, and the uncertainties associated with obtaining regulatory approval and ultimately commercializing its products, management has identified conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about CEL-SCIs ability to continue as a going concern. CEL-SCIs ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon, among other factors, the sale of its securities or obtaining alternate financing.\nCEL-SCI will require substantial additional capital to remain in operation. A failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed could force CEL-SCI to delay, limit, reduce or terminate the product candidates development or commercialization efforts.\nAs of September 30, 2022, CEL-SCI had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $22.7 million. CEL-SCI believes that it will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future developing Multikine, LEAPS and any other product candidates or technologies that it may develop or acquire. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development, obtaining regulatory approvals and having the products manufactured, as well as marketing and selling products approved for sale, if any. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. CEL-SCI cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of the product candidates.\nCEL-SCIs future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe cost of completing Phase 3 clinical development of Multikine for the treatment of certain head and neck cancers;\n\u00b7\nthe results of the applications to and meetings with the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities and the consequential effect on operating costs;\n\u00b7\nthe cost, timing and outcome of the efforts to obtain marketing approval for Multikine in the United States, Europe and in other jurisdictions, including the preparation and filing of regulatory submissions for Multikine with the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of additional preclinical, clinical, or other studies for additional indications for Multikine, LEAPS and other product candidates and technologies that CEL-SCI may develop or acquire;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for LEAPS if clinical studies are successful;\n\u00b7\nthe cost and timing of future commercialization activities for the products, if any of the product candidates are approved for marketing, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n\u00b7\nthe revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of the product candidates for which CEL-SCI receives marketing approval;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of having the product candidates manufactured for clinical trials and in preparation for commercialization;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n\u00b7\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, defending and enforcing its intellectual property rights, including litigation costs, and the outcome of such litigation; and\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which CEL-SCI acquires or in-licenses other products or technologies.\nCEL-SCI will need to raise additional funds in order to continue its operations and additional funds may not be available when CEL-SCI needs them on terms that are acceptable to CEL-SCI, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to CEL-SCI on a timely basis, CEL-SCI may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate preclinical studies, clinical trials or other development activities for Multikine, LEAPS, or any other product candidates or technologies that CEL-SCI develops or acquires, or delay, limit, reduce or terminate its sales and marketing activities that may be necessary to commercialize its product candidates. Due to recurring losses from operations and future liquidity needs, there is substantial doubt about CEL-SCIs ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital becoming available. The substantial doubt about CEL-SCIs ability to continue as a going concern could have an adverse impact on CEL-SCIs ability to execute its business plan, result in the reluctance on the part of certain suppliers to do business with CEL-SCI, or adversely affect CEL-SCIs ability to raise additional debt or equity capital.\nThe costs of the product candidates development and clinical trials are difficult to estimate and will be very high for many years, preventing CEL-SCI from making a profit for the foreseeable future, if ever.\nClinical and other studies necessary to obtain approval of a new drug or biologic can be time consuming and costly, especially in the United States, but also in foreign countries. The estimates of the costs associated with future clinical trials and research may be substantially lower than what CEL-SCI actually experiences. It is impossible to predict what CEL-SCI will face in the development of a product candidate such as Multikine. The purpose of clinical trials is to provide both CEL-SCI and regulatory authorities with safety and efficacy data in humans. The difficult and often complex steps necessary to obtain regulatory approval, especially that of the FDA and the EMA, involve significant costs and may require several years to complete. CEL-SCI expects that it will need substantial additional financing over an extended period of time in order to fund the costs of future clinical trials, related research, and general and administrative expenses.\nCEL-SCIs LEAPS technology may not result in a viable drug candidate\nUsing CEL-SCIs LEAPS technology, CEL-SCI is also developing a LEAPS immunotherapy for the potential treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, the development of this technology is in a preliminary stage. There can be no assurance that the LEAPS technology will be successful in treating any disease. CEL-SCIs primary focus at present is seeking the approval of Multikine for the treatment of head and neck cancer.\nAn adverse determination in any future legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on CEL-SCI.\nCEL-SCI may be the target of claims asserting violations of securities fraud and derivative actions, or other litigation or arbitration proceedings in the future. Any future litigation could result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources. These legal proceedings may result in large judgments or settlements against CEL-SCI, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nCompliance with changing regulations concerning corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. New or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases. As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time. CEL-SCI is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. Complying with evolving interpretations of new or changing legal requirements may cause CEL-SCI to incur higher costs as CEL-SCI revises current practices, policies and procedures, and may divert managements time and attention from potential revenue-generating activities to compliance matters. If the efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, CEL-SCIs reputation may also be harmed. Further, CEL-SCIs board members, chief executive officer, and other executive officers could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, CEL-SCI may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which could harm its business.\nCEL-SCI has not established a definite plan for the marketing of Multikine, if approved.\nCEL-SCI has not established a definitive plan for marketing Multikine nor has CEL-SCI established a price structure for any of its product candidates, if approved. However, CEL-SCI intends, if it is in a position to do so, to sell Multikine itself in certain markets where it is approved and/or to enter into written marketing agreements with various third parties with established sales forces in such markets. The sales forces in turn would, CEL-SCI believes, focus on selling Multikine to targeted cancer centers, physicians and clinics involved in the treatment of head and neck cancer. CEL-SCI has already licensed future sales of Multikine, if approved, to three companies: Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. in Israel, Turkey, Serbia and Croatia; Orient Europharma in Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Korea, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand; and Byron BioPharma, LLC in South Africa. CEL-SCI believes that these companies will have the resources to market Multikine appropriately in their respective territories, if approved, but there is no guarantee that they will. There is no assurance that CEL-SCI will be able to find qualified third-party partners to market its products in other areas, on terms that are favorable to CEL-SCI, or at all.\nCEL-SCI may encounter problems, delays and additional expenses in developing marketing plans with third parties. In addition, even if Multikine, if approved, is cost-effective and demonstrated to increase overall patient survival, CEL-SCI may experience other limitations involving the proposed sale of Multikine, such as uncertainty of third-party coverage and reimbursement. There is no assurance that CEL-SCI can successfully market Multikine, if approved, or any other product candidates it may develop.\nCEL-SCI hopes to expand its clinical development capabilities in the future, and any difficulties hiring or retaining key personnel or managing this growth could disrupt its operations.\nCEL-SCI is highly dependent on the principal members of its management and development staff. CEL-SCI expects to expand its clinical development and manufacturing capabilities, which will involve hiring additional employees. Future growth will require CEL-SCI to continue to implement and improve its managerial, operational and financial systems and continue to retain, recruit and train additional qualified personnel, which may impose a strain on its administrative and its operational infrastructure. The competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense. CEL-SCI is highly dependent on its ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and specialized personnel required for clinical development. Due to limited resources, CEL-SCI may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of its operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. If CEL-SCI is unable to retain key personnel or manage its future growth effectively, CEL-SCI may not be able to implement its business plan.\nIf product liability or patient injury lawsuits are brought against CEL-SCI, CEL-SCI may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit clinical testing or future commercialization of Multikine or its other product candidates.\nCEL-SCI faces an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of Multikine and other product candidates and will face an even greater risk if CEL-SCI is able to commercialize any of its product candidates. For example, CEL-SCI may be sued if its Multikine or LEAPS product candidates, or any other future product candidates, allegedly cause injury or are found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing or, if approved, marketing, sale or during administration to patients. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product candidate, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts.\nFurthermore, Multikine is made, in part, from components of human blood. There are inherent risks associated with products that involve human blood such as possible contamination with viruses, including hepatitis or HIV. Any possible contamination could cause injuries to patients who receive contaminated Multikine, or could require CEL-SCI to destroy batches of Multikine, thereby subjecting CEL-SCI to possible financial losses, lawsuits and harm to its business.\nIf CEL-SCI cannot successfully defend itself against product liability claims, CEL-SCI may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit or cease the clinical testing or commercialization of its product candidates, if approved. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for Multikine or other product candidates, if approved and commercialized, or clinical holds or suspension of the IND while the candidates are still in clinical development;\n\u00b7\ninjury to CEL-SCIs reputation;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of existing, or failure to enroll additional, clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7\ncosts to defend any related litigation;\n\u00b7\na diversion of managements time and resources;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u00b7\nrecalls of approved products, withdrawal of BLA approvals or new labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u00b7\nloss of revenue;\n\u00b7\ninability to commercialize Multikine or other product candidates; and\n\u00b7\na decline in the price of CEL-SCIs common stock.\nAlthough CEL-SCI has product liability insurance for Multikine in the amount of $10 million, the successful prosecution of a product liability case against CEL-SCI could have a materially adverse effect upon its business if the amount of any judgment exceeds the insurance coverage. Any claim that may be brought against CEL-SCI could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by CEL-SCIs insurance or that is in excess of the limits of the insurance coverage. CEL-SCIs insurance policies also have various exclusions, and CEL-SCI may be subject to a claim for which CEL-SCI has no coverage. CEL-SCI may have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed the coverage limitations or that are not covered by its insurance, and CEL-SCI may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts. CEL-SCI commenced the Phase 3 clinical trial for Multikine in December 2010. Although no claims have been brought to date, participants in the clinical trials could bring civil actions against CEL-SCI for any unanticipated harmful effects allegedly arising from the use of Multikine or any other product candidate that CEL-SCI may attempt to develop.\nCEL-SCIs commercial success depends, in part, upon attaining significant market acceptance of its product candidates, if approved, among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and major operators of cancer clinics.\nEven if CEL-SCI obtains regulatory approval for its product candidates, any resulting product may not gain market acceptance among physicians, healthcare payors, patients and the medical community, which are critical to commercial success. Market acceptance of any product candidate for which CEL-SCI receives approval depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe efficacy and safety of the products as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of market introduction of such product as well as competitive products;\n\u00b7\nthe clinical indications for which the biological product is approved;\n\u00b7\nthe approval, availability, market acceptance and reimbursement for the companion diagnostic, if appropriate or necessary;\n\u00b7\nacceptance by physicians, major operators of cancer clinics and patients of the biologic as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u00b7\nthe potential and perceived advantages of such product candidate over alternative treatments, especially with respect to patient subsets that are targeted with such product;\n\u00b7\nthe safety of such product seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;\n\u00b7\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; and\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts.\nIf CEL-SCIs product candidates are approved but fail to achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, healthcare payors and patients, CEL-SCI will not be able to generate significant revenues, and CEL-SCI may not become or remain profitable.\nUnder CEL-SCIs amended bylaws, stockholders that initiate certain proceedings may be obligated to reimburse CEL-SCI and its officers and directors for all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with such proceedings if the claim proves unsuccessful.\nOn February 18, 2015, CEL-SCI adopted new bylaws which include a fee-shifting provision in Article X for stockholder claims. Article X provides that in the event any stockholder initiates or asserts a claim against CEL-SCI, or any of its officers or directors, including any derivative claim or claim purportedly filed on CEL-SCIs behalf, and the stockholder does not obtain a judgment on the merits that substantially achieves, in substance and amount, the full remedy sought, then the stockholder will be obligated to reimburse CEL-SCI and any of its officers or directors named in the action, for all fees, costs and expenses of every kind and description that CEL-SCI or its officers or directors may incur in connection with the claim. In adopting Article X, it is the intent that:\n\u00b7\nall actions, including federal securities law claims, would be subject to Article X;\n\u00b7\nthe phrase a judgment on the merits means the determination by a court of competent jurisdiction on the matters submitted to the court;\n\u00b7\nthe phrase substantially achieves, in both substance and amount means the plaintiffs in the action would be awarded at least 90% of the relief sought;\n\u00b7\nonly persons who were stockholders at the time an action was brought would be subject to Article X; and\n\u00b7\nin addition to CEL-SCI, only the directors or officers named in the action would be allowed to recover.\nThe fee-shifting provision contained in Article X of the bylaws is not limited to specific types of actions, but is rather potentially applicable to the fullest extent permitted by law. Fee-shifting bylaws are relatively new and untested. The case law and potential legislative action on fee-shifting bylaws are evolving and there exists considerable uncertainty regarding the validity of, and potential judicial and legislative responses to, such bylaws. For example, it is unclear whether the ability to invoke the fee-shifting bylaw in connection with claims under the federal securities laws would be pre-empted by federal law. Similarly, it is unclear how courts might apply the standard that a claiming stockholder must obtain a judgment that substantially achieves, in substance and amount, the full remedy sought. The application of the fee-shifting bylaw in connection with such claims, if any, will depend in part on future developments of the law. CEL-SCI cannot assure its shareholders that CEL-SCI will or will not invoke the fee-shifting bylaw in any particular dispute. In addition, given the unsettled state of the law related to fee-shifting bylaws, such as CEL-SCIs, CEL-SCI may incur significant additional costs associated with resolving disputes with respect to such bylaw, which could adversely affect CEL-SCIs business and financial condition.\nIf a stockholder that brings any such claim, suit, action or proceeding is unable to obtain the required judgment, the attorneys fees and other litigation expenses that might be shifted to a claiming stockholder are potentially significant. This fee-shifting bylaw may therefore dissuade or discourage stockholders and their attorneys from initiating lawsuits or claims against CEL-SCI or its directors and officers. In addition, it may impact the fees, contingency or otherwise, required by potential plaintiffs attorneys to represent the stockholders or otherwise discourage plaintiffs attorneys from representing the stockholders at all. As a result, this bylaw may limit the ability of stockholders to alter CEL-SCIs management and direction, particularly through litigation or the threat of litigation.\nThe provision of the amended bylaws requiring exclusive venue in the U.S. District Court for Delaware for certain types of lawsuits may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against CEL-SCI and its directors and officers.\nArticle X of CEL-SCIs amended bylaws provides that stockholder claims brought against CEL-SCI, or its officers or directors, including any derivative claim or claim purportedly filed on its behalf, must be brought in the U.S. District Court for the district of Delaware and that with respect to any such claim, the laws of Delaware will apply.\nThe exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum the stockholder finds favorable for disputes with CEL-SCI or its directors or officers and may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits with respect to claims that may benefit CEL-SCI or its stockholders.\nA provision in our Bylaws regarding shareholder claims may not be enforceable.\nArticle X of our bylaws provides that stockholder claims brought against us, or our officers or directors, including any derivative claim or claim purportedly filed on our behalf, must be brought in the U.S. District Court for the district of Delaware.\nAlthough it is our intent that this provision applies to actions arising under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce this provision since Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations under the Securities Act.\nIn addition, since this provision in our bylaws applies to state law claims there is uncertainty as to whether any court would enforce this provision.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development, Government Approvals and the Marketing of Biopharmaceutical Products\nCEL-SCI depends heavily on the success of Multikine, for which Phase 3 data has been presented, while its other candidates are still in preclinical phases. CEL-SCIs product candidates must undergo rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approvals, which could be costly and time-consuming and subject CEL-SCI to unanticipated delays or prevent CEL-SCI from marketing any products. If CEL-SCI is unable to advance its product candidates in clinical development, obtain regulatory approval and ultimately commercialize its product candidates, or experiences significant delays in doing so, CEL-SCIs business will be materially harmed.\nCEL-SCI currently has no products approved for sale and CEL-SCI cannot guarantee that it will ever have marketable products. CEL-SCIs product candidates are subject to premarket approval from the FDA in the United States, the EMA in the European Union, and by comparable agencies in most foreign countries before they can be sold. Before obtaining marketing approval, these product candidates must undergo costly and time consuming preclinical and clinical testing which could subject CEL-SCI to unanticipated delays and may prevent CEL-SCI from marketing the product candidates in the future. There can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of the product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. CEL-SCIs current and future clinical trials may not be successful.\nCEL-SCI is in the early development stages for the candidates designed using its LEAPS technology and has not yet initiated any clinical studies for any of those product candidates. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u00b7\nthe availability of financial resources needed to commence and complete the planned trials;\n\u00b7\nobtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u00b7\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u00b7\nobtaining Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approval at each clinical trial site;\n\u00b7\nrecruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u00b7\nhaving patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u00b7\nclinical trial sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u00b7\nadding new clinical trial sites; or\n\u00b7\nmanufacturing sufficient quantities of the product candidate for use in clinical trials.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the competence of the CRO running the study, size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians' and patients perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications CEL-SCI is investigating. Furthermore, CEL-SCI relies on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of the clinical trials and while CEL-SCI has agreements governing their committed activities, CEL-SCI has limited influence over their actual performance.\nCEL-SCI could also encounter significant delays and/or need to terminate a development program for a product candidate if physicians encounter unresolved ethical issues associated with enrolling patients in clinical trials of the product candidates while existing treatments have established safety and efficacy profiles. Further, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by CEL-SCI, one or more of the IRBs for the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by CEL-SCI upon a final recommendation by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC, with which CEL-SCI agrees for such trial, or by FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or the clinical protocols, as a result of inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site(s) by FDA or other regulatory authorities, the imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product candidate, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. The occurrence of any one or more of these events would have significant and severe material consequences for CEL-SCI and could impact CEL-SCIs ability to continue as a going concern.\nIf CEL-SCI experiences termination of, or delays in the completion of, any clinical trial of its product candidates, the commercial prospects for the product candidates will be harmed, and the ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing the clinical trials will increase the costs, slow the product development and approval process and jeopardize the ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm CEL-SCIs business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations significantly. Many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to a delay or the denial of regulatory approval for the product candidates.\nCEL-SCI cannot be certain when or under what conditions it will undertake future clinical trials. Early trials for the other product candidates, or the plans for later trials, may not satisfy the requirements of regulatory authorities, such as the FDA. CEL-SCI may fail to find subjects willing to enroll in the trials. Accordingly, the clinical trials relating to the product candidates may not be completed on schedule, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may order CEL-SCI to stop or modify research, or these agencies may not ultimately approve any of the product candidates for commercial sale. Varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of the product candidates. The data collected from the clinical trials may not be sufficient to support regulatory approval of the various product candidates, including Multikine. The failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any of the product candidates would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product candidates in the United States, which could prevent CEL-SCI from achieving profitability.\nThe development and testing of product candidates and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, termination of the Phase 3 study, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, and payment of civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on CEL-SCI.\nThe requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing of the product candidates, including Multikine, outside the United States vary from country to country. Foreign approvals may take longer to obtain than FDA approvals and can require, among other things, additional testing and different trial designs. Foreign regulatory approval processes include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process. Some of those agencies also must approve prices for products approved for marketing. Approval of a product by the FDA or the EMA does not ensure approval of the same product by the health authorities of other countries. In addition, changes in regulatory requirements for product approval in any country during the clinical trial process and regulatory agency review of each submitted new application may cause delays or rejections.\nCEL-SCI has only limited experience in filing and pursuing applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals. The lack of experience may impede its ability to obtain timely approvals from regulatory agencies, if at all. CEL-SCI will not be able to commercialize Multikine and other product candidates until CEL-SCI has obtained regulatory approval. In addition, regulatory authorities may also limit the types of patients to which CEL-SCI or its third-party partners may market Multikine (if approved) or the other product candidates. Any failure to obtain or any delay in obtaining required regulatory approvals may adversely affect CEL-SCIs or its third-party partners ability to successfully market the product candidates after they are approved.\nEven if CEL-SCI obtains regulatory approval for its investigational products, CEL-SCI will be subject to stringent, ongoing government regulation.\nIf CEL-SCIs investigational products receive regulatory approval, either in the United States or internationally, those products will be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval and may contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance of the safety and efficacy of the investigational products. CEL-SCI will continue to be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. These regulations are wide-ranging and govern, among other things:\n\u00b7\nproduct design, development and manufacture;\n\u00b7\nproduct application and use\n\u00b7\nadverse drug experience monitoring reporting;\n\u00b7\nproduct advertising and promotion;\n\u00b7\nproduct manufacturing, including compliance with good manufacturing practices\n\u00b7\nrecord keeping requirements;\n\u00b7\nregistration and listing of products with the FDA, EMA and other state and national agencies;\n\u00b7\nproduct storage and shipping;\n\u00b7\ndrug sampling and distribution requirements;\n\u00b7\nelectronic record and signature requirements; and\n\u00b7\nlabeling changes or modifications.\nCEL-SCI and any of its third-party manufacturers or suppliers must continually adhere to federal regulations setting forth human drug and biologic manufacturing requirements, known as current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and their foreign equivalents, which are enforced by the FDA, the EMA and other national regulatory bodies through their facilities inspection programs. If the facilities, or the facilities of the contract manufacturers or suppliers, cannot pass a pre-approval inspection by regulators or fail such inspections in the future, the FDA, EMA or other national regulators will not approve the marketing applications for the product candidates, or may withdraw any prior approval. In complying with cGMP and foreign regulatory requirements, CEL-SCI and any of its potential third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be obligated to expend time, money and effort in production, record-keeping and quality control to ensure that the product candidates meet applicable specifications and other requirements.\nIf CEL-SCI does not comply with regulatory requirements at any stage, whether before or after marketing approval is obtained, CEL-SCI may be subject to, among other things, license suspension or revocation, criminal prosecution, seizure, injunction, fines, be forced to remove a product from the market or experience other adverse consequences, including restrictions or delays in obtaining regulatory marketing approval for such products or for other product candidates for which CEL-SCI seeks approval. This could materially harm CEL-SCIs financial results, reputation and stock price. Additionally, CEL-SCI may not be able to obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable for product promotion. If CEL-SCI or other parties identify adverse effects after any of the products are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval may be suspended or withdrawn. CEL-SCI may be required to reformulate products, conduct additional clinical trials, make changes in product labeling or indications of use, or submit additional marketing applications to support any changes. If CEL-SCI encounters any of the foregoing problems, its business and results of operations will be harmed and the market price of its common stock may decline.\nThe FDA and other governmental authorities policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of CEL-SCIs product candidates. If CEL-SCI is slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if CEL-SCI is not able to maintain regulatory compliance, CEL-SCI may lose any marketing approval that it may have obtained, which would adversely affect its business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability. CEL-SCI cannot predict the extent of adverse government regulations which might arise from future legislative or administrative action. Without government approval, CEL-SCI will be unable to sell any of its product candidates.\nCEL-SCIs product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial utility of an approved prescribing label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nUndesirable side effects caused by its product candidates could cause CEL-SCI or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. Results of the clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and/or prevalence of these or other side effects. In such an event, the trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order CEL-SCI to cease further development of, or deny approval of, the product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm CEL-SCIs business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nAdditionally, if one or more of the product candidates receives marketing approval, and CEL-SCI or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product or require product recalls;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label or impose restrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may require CEL-SCI to conduct new post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nCEL-SCI could receive warning or untitled letters from the FDA or comparable notices of violations from foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nCEL-SCI may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u00b7\nCEL-SCI could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u00b7\nCEL-SCIs reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent CEL-SCI from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of a particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm its business, results of operations and prospects.\nCEL-SCI relies on third parties to conduct its preclinical and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties and meet regulatory requirements, or meet expected deadlines, CEL-SCI may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize the product candidates and its business could be substantially harmed.\nCEL-SCI does not have the ability to independently conduct large clinical trials. CEL-SCI has relied upon and plans to continue to rely upon third-party CROs to prepare for, conduct, monitor and manage data for its ongoing preclinical and clinical programs, including the global Phase 3 trial for Multikine. CEL-SCI relies on these parties for all aspects of the execution of its clinical trials and although CEL-SCI diligently oversees and carefully manages the CROs, CEL-SCI directly controls only certain aspects of their activities and relies upon them to provide timely, complete, and accurate reports on the conduct of the studies. Although such third parties provide support and represent CEL-SCI for regulatory purposes in the context of the clinical trials, ultimately CEL-SCI is responsible for ensuring that each of the studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards, and the reliance on the CROs does not relieve CEL-SCI of its regulatory responsibilities. CEL-SCI and the CROs acting on CEL-SCIs behalf, as well as principal investigators and trial sites, are required to comply with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and other applicable requirements, which are implemented through regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area, or EEA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of the products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, and trial sites. If CEL-SCI or any of the CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs or other applicable regulations, the clinical data generated in the clinical trials may be determined to be unreliable and CEL-SCI may therefore need to enroll additional subjects in the clinical trials, or the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require CEL-SCI to perform an additional clinical trial or trials before approving the marketing applications. Moreover, if CEL-SCI or any of the CROs, principal investigators, or trial sites, fail to comply with applicable regulatory and GCP requirements, CEL-SCI, the CROs, principal investigators, or trial sites may be subject to enforcement actions, such as fines, warning letters, untitled letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, and/or injunctions. CEL-SCI cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of the clinical trials comply with cGCP regulations. In addition, the clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. The failure to comply with these regulations may require CEL-SCI to delay or repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nIf any of the relationships with the third-party CROs terminate, CEL-SCI may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, the CROs are not CEL-SCIs employees, and except for remedies available to CEL-SCI under the agreements with such CROs, CEL-SCI cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to the on-going clinical, nonclinical and preclinical programs. If CROs do not successfully fulfill their regulatory obligations, carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to the clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, the clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and CEL-SCI may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, the product candidates. As a result, CEL-SCIs results of operations and the commercial prospects for the product candidates would be harmed, the costs could increase and the ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nSwitching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays may occur, which can materially impact CEL-SCIs ability to meet the desired clinical development timelines. Though CEL-SCI diligently oversees and carefully manages its relationships with the CROs, there can be no assurance that CEL-SCI will not encounter similar challenges or delays in clinical development in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on CEL-SCIs business, financial condition and prospects.\nCEL-SCI has obtained orphan drug designation from the FDA for Multikine for neoadjuvant, or primary, therapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, but CEL-SCI may be unable to maintain the benefits associated with orphan drug designation, including the potential for market exclusivity.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is defined as one occurring in a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug or biologic will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity.\nEven though CEL-SCI has received orphan drug designation for Multikine for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, CEL-SCI may not be the first to obtain marketing approval of a product for the orphan-designated indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products. CEL-SCI believes this to be unlikely since it does not know of any other company with a similar technology in Phase 3 studies. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be limited if CEL-SCI seeks approval for an indication broader than the orphan-designated indication, or may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if CEL-SCI is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Further, even if CEL-SCI obtains orphan drug exclusivity for a product candidate, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product candidate from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan product is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve another drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nBiologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on future results of CEL-SCIs operations.\nThe successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biological products like CEL-SCIs candidates is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell its biological product candidates would adversely impact CEL-SCIs business and future results of operations.\nCEL-SCI may face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing competing products more quickly or more successfully than CEL-SCI.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug and biological products is highly competitive. CEL-SCI expects to face competition with respect to any product candidates that CEL-SCI may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.\nMany of the companies which CEL-SCI may compete with in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, nonclinical studies, conducting clinical trials, obtaining marketing approvals and marketing approved products than CEL-SCI. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of CEL-SCIs potential competitors. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties may compete with CEL-SCI in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, CEL-SCIs programs.\nCEL-SCI may be unable to successfully scale-up manufacturing of its lead product candidate Multikine in sufficient quality and quantity, which would delay or prevent CEL-SCI from commercializing this product, if approved for marketing by the FDA or other regulatory agencies.\nIn order to commercialize its product candidates, CEL-SCI will need to manufacture them in large quantities. At the present time, CEL-SCI is not manufacturing Multikine while the manufacturing plant for Multikine is being validated to produce commercial quantities of Multikine, if approved. CEL-SCI may be unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for its lead product candidate Multikine due to issues that may arise during scale-up activities.\nFurther, in order to release product and demonstrate stability of product candidates for future commercial use, CEL-SCIs analytical methods must be validated in accordance with regulatory guidelines. CEL-SCI may not be able to successfully validate or maintain validation of its analytical methods during scale-up or demonstrate adequate purity, stability or comparability of its biological product candidates in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. Even if CEL-SCI believes its manufacturing processes meets all of the regulatory manufacturing requirements, the FDA will review those processes and the manufacturing facility as part of the review of the future BLA for Multikine when submitted. If CEL-SCI is unable to successfully scale up the manufacture of Multikine in sufficient quality and quantity, or if CEL-SCI encounters validation issues, the development, testing, and clinical trials of future product candidates, may be delayed or infeasible, and regulatory approval or commercial launch of any resulting product, including Multikine, may be delayed or may not be successfully achieved.\nThe current and future relationships with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, potential customers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere may be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable healthcare laws and regulations.\nAlthough CEL-SCI does not currently have any products on the market, if CEL-SCI begins commercializing its product candidates, CEL-SCI will be subject to additional healthcare statutory and regulatory requirements and oversight by federal and state governments as well as foreign governments in the jurisdictions in which CEL-SCI conducts its business. Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any drug candidates for which CEL-SCI obtains marketing approval. The current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, potential customers and third-party payors may expose CEL-SCI to broadly applicable healthcare laws, including, without limitation:\n\u00b7\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;\n\u00b7\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private), knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA, which also imposes obligations on covered entities, including healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7\nthe U.S. federal physicians payment transparency requirements, sometimes called the Sunshine Act and its implementing regulations, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Childrens Health Insurance Program to report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to physician payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals (and, beginning in 2021, for transfers of value to other healthcare providers), as well as the ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u00b7\nanalogous state and foreign laws, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government which otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts;\n\u00b7\nthe U.S. federal laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under federal healthcare programs; and\n\u00b7\nstate and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that the future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that the business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws. If CEL-SCIs operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations, CEL-SCI may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of the operations, all of which could significantly harm CEL-SCIs business. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom CEL-SCI expects to do business, including current and future collaborators, are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also adversely affect CEL-SCIs business.\nFailure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for the product candidates, if approved, could limit the ability to market those products and decrease CEL-SCIs ability to generate revenue.\nSales of CEL-SCIs product candidates will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of the approved products will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit, and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. CEL-SCI anticipates that government authorities and other third-party payors will continue efforts to contain healthcare costs by limiting the coverage and reimbursement levels for new drugs and biologics. If coverage and reimbursement are not available, or are available only to limited levels, CEL-SCI may not be able to successfully commercialize its product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow CEL-SCI to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a return on its investment. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for CEL-SCIs product candidates.\nMoreover, in some countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, CEL-SCI may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of its product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of its products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, CEL-SCIs business could be harmed, possibly materially.\nEven if any product candidate receives marketing approval, it may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nIf CEL-SCIs product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, CEL-SCI may not generate significant product revenues and CEL-SCI may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of its product candidates, including Multikine if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe timing of CEL-SCIs receipt of any marketing approvals;\n\u00b7\nthe terms of any approvals and the countries in which approvals are obtained;\n\u00b7\nthe efficacy and safety and potential advantages and disadvantages compared to alternative treatments, including future alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects associated with CEL-SCIs product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe indications for which its products are approved and the scope of risk information required to be included in the product labeling;\n\u00b7\nadverse publicity about CEL-SCIs products or favorable publicity about competing products;\n\u00b7\nthe approval of other products for the same indications as CEL-SCIs products;\n\u00b7\nCEL-SCIs ability to offer its products for sale at competitive prices;\n\u00b7\nthe convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u00b7\nthe success of CEL-SCIs physician education programs;\n\u00b7\nthe strength of CEL-SCIs marketing and distribution support; and\n\u00b7\nthe availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement.\nIf any product candidate CEL-SCI commercializes fails to achieve market acceptance, it could have a material and adverse effect on CEL-SCIs business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects.\nCEL-SCI currently has no marketing and sales force. If CEL-SCI is unable to establish effective sales or marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell or market its product candidates, CEL-SCI may not be able to effectively sell or market its product candidates, if approved, or generate product revenues.\nCEL-SCI currently has no sales and marketing infrastructure due to the fact that all of its product candidates are still in clinical development. To achieve commercial success for any approved product candidate for which CEL-SCI retains sales and marketing responsibilities, CEL-SCI must build its sales, marketing, managerial, and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, CEL-SCI has entered into agreements with certain foreign distributors to commercialize Multikine, if approved, within their respective territories. However, CEL-SCI may determine that there is a need to build its own sales force in the United States for the future marketing of Multikine, if approved, rather than seeking a U.S. co-marketing partner or relying on a contracted sales force. There are risks involved with either establishing its own sales and marketing capabilities or entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which CEL-SCI recruits a sales force and establishes marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, CEL-SCI would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and its investment would be lost if CEL-SCI cannot retain or reposition its sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit CEL-SCIs efforts to commercialize its product candidates on its own include:\n\u00b7\nCEL-SCIs inability to recruit, hire, retain and incentivize adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to use and administer CEL-SCIs future products;\n\u00b7\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put CEL-SCI at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u00b7\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with establishing an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf CEL-SCI does not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on its own or in collaboration with third parties, CEL-SCI will not be successful in commercializing Multikine, if approved, or any of its other product candidates that receive marketing approval or any such commercialization may experience delays or limitations.\nCEL-SCIs business activities may be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws of other countries in which CEL-SCI operates or will operate in the future.\nCEL-SCI has conducted and has ongoing studies in international locations and may in the future initiate additional studies in countries other than the United States. Moreover, CEL-SCI has entered into agreements with foreign distributors to commercialize Multikine, if approved, in various territories outside of the United States. As a result, CEL-SCIs business activities may be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which CEL-SCI operates. The FCPA generally prohibits offering, promising, giving or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.\nCEL-SCIs business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the healthcare providers who prescribe biopharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of biopharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, CEL-SCIs dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. Recently the SEC and Department of Justice have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. There is no certainty that all of CEL-SCIs employees, agents or contractors conducting business abroad will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, particularly given the high level of complexity of these laws. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against CEL-SCI, its officers or employees, the closing of CEL-SCIs facilities, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs and prohibitions on the conduct of CEL-SCIs business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on CEL-SCIs ability to offer its product candidates, if approved, in one or more countries and could materially damage its reputation, its brand, its future international marketing efforts, its ability to attract and retain employees and its business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nHealthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on CEL-SCIs business and results of operations.\nExisting regulatory policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of CEL-SCIs product candidates. CEL-SCI cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If CEL-SCI is slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if CEL-SCI is not able to maintain regulatory compliance, CEL-SCI may lose any marketing approval that it may have obtained and it may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs that may result in more limited coverage or downward pressure on the price CEL-SCI may otherwise receive for its product candidates. For example, in March 2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, which expanded healthcare coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage and which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under federal healthcare programs. The ACA contains a number of provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drug and biological products and/or that could potentially reduce the demand for pharmaceutical products such as increasing drug rebates under state Medicaid programs for brand name prescription drugs and extending those rebates to Medicaid managed care and assessing a fee on manufacturers and importers of brand name prescription drugs reimbursed under certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminates the tax penalty established under the ACA for individuals who do not maintain mandated health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. In a May 2018 report, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that, compared to 2018, the number of uninsured will increase by 3 million in 2019 and 6 million in 2028, in part due to the elimination of the individual mandate. The ACA has also been subject to judicial challenge. In December 2018, a federal district court, in a challenge brought by a number of state attorneys general, found the ACA unconstitutional in its entirety because, once Congress repealed the individual mandate provision, there was no longer a basis to rely on Congressional taxing authority to support enactment of the law. Pending appeals, which could take some time, the ACA is still operational in all respects.\nCEL-SCIs industry continues to face potential changes in the legal and regulatory landscape on the federal, state and international levels. Additional legislative actions to control U.S. healthcare or other costs have passed. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. There has also been increasing and considerable public and government interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices, including proposed federal and state legislation designed to bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, put in place limits and caps on pharmaceutical prices, request rebates for certain pharmaceutical products, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what biopharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. In markets outside of the United States, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and control the prices of medicinal products for human use.\nCEL-SCI expects that current or future healthcare reform measures may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that it receives for any approved product, including Multikine if it is approved for commercialization. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent CEL-SCI from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize its product candidates.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals also have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for biotechnology products. CEL-SCI cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations for biological products will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of its product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDAs approval and decision-making processes may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject CEL-SCI to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nForeign governments often impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect CEL-SCIs future profitability.\nCEL-SCI intends to seek approval to market its lead investigational product, Multikine, in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. If CEL-SCI obtains approval in one or more foreign jurisdictions, CEL-SCI will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions relating to Multikine. In some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, prescription drug pricing is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a drug candidate. Coverage and reimbursement decisions in one foreign jurisdiction may impact decisions in other countries. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, CEL-SCI may be required to conduct clinical trials that demonstrate the product candidate is more effective than current treatments and that compare the cost-effectiveness of Multikine to other available therapies. If reimbursement of Multikine is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, CEL-SCI may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nIf CEL-SCI fails to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, CEL-SCI could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm its business.\nCEL-SCI is subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes generated in its biologic manufacturing facility. CEL-SCI cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from its use of hazardous materials, including radioactive materials used in its research laboratory, CEL-SCI could be held liable for any resulting damages, and the amount of the liability could exceed its resources. CEL-SCI also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nCEL-SCI may not be able to achieve or maintain a competitive position, and other technological developments may result in its proprietary technologies becoming uneconomical or obsolete.\nCEL-SCI is involved in a biomedical field that is undergoing rapid and significant technological change. The pace of change continues to accelerate. The successful development of product candidates from the compounds, compositions and processes, through research financed by CEL-SCI, or as a result of possible third-party licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical or other companies, is not assured. CEL-SCI may fail to apply for patents on important technologies or product candidates in a timely fashion, or at all.\nMany companies are working on drugs designed to cure or treat cancer. Many of these companies have financial, research and development, and marketing resources which are much greater than CEL-SCIs and are capable of providing significant long-term competition either by establishing in-house research groups or by forming collaborative ventures with other entities. In addition, smaller companies and non-profit institutions are active in research relating to cancer and infectious diseases. The future market share of Multikine or the other product candidates, if approved, will be reduced or eliminated if the competitors develop and obtain approval for products that are safer or more effective than CEL-SCIS product candidates. Moreover, the patent positions of pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are often evolving and remain unresolved. As a result, the validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, CEL-SCI does not know whether:\n\u00b7\nCEL-SCI was the first to make the inventions covered by each of its issued patents and pending patent applications;\n\u00b7\nCEL-SCI was the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u00b7\nothers will independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of CEL-SCIs technologies;\n\u00b7\nany of the pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u00b7\nany of the patents will be valid or enforceable;\n\u00b7\nany patents issued to CEL-SCI or its collaboration partners will provide CEL-SCI with any competitive advantages or will be challenged by third parties;\n\u00b7\nCEL-SCI will be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u00b7\nthe U.S. government will exercise any of its statutory rights to CEL-SCIs intellectual property that was developed with government funding; or\n\u00b7\nits business may infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others.\nCEL-SCIs patents might not protect its technology from competitors, in which case CEL-SCI may not have any advantage over competitors in selling any products that CEL-SCI may develop.\nCEL-SCIs commercial success will depend in part on its ability to obtain additional patents and protect its existing patent position, as well as its ability to maintain adequate intellectual property protection for the technologies, product candidates, and any future products in the United States and other countries. If CEL-SCI does not adequately protect its technology, product candidates and future products, competitors may be able to use or practice them and erode or negate any competitive advantage CEL-SCI may have, which could harm CEL-SCIs business and its ability to achieve profitability. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect the proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as U.S. laws, and CEL-SCI may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending its proprietary rights in these countries. CEL-SCI will be able to protect its proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that its proprietary technologies, product candidates and any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.\nCertain aspects of CEL-SCIs technologies are covered by U.S. and foreign patents. In addition, CEL-SCI has a number of new patent applications pending. There is no assurance that the applications which are pending or which may be filed in the future will result in the issuance of any patents. Furthermore, there is no assurance as to the breadth and degree of protection any issued patents might afford CEL-SCI. Disputes may arise between CEL-SCI and others as to the scope and validity of these or other patents. Any defense of the patents could prove costly and time consuming and there can be no assurance that CEL-SCI will be in a position, or will deem it advisable, to carry on such a defense. A suit for patent infringement could result in increasing costs, delaying or halting development, or even forcing CEL-SCI to abandon a product candidate. Other private and public concerns, including universities, may have filed applications for, may have been issued, or may obtain additional patents and other proprietary rights to technology potentially useful or necessary to CEL-SCI. CEL-SCI is not currently aware of any such patents, but the scope and validity of such patents, if any, and the cost and availability of such rights are impossible to predict.\nMuch of CEL-SCIs intellectual property is protected as trade secrets or confidential know-how, not as a patent.\nCEL-SCI considers proprietary trade secrets and/or confidential and unpatented know-how to be important to its business. Much of the intellectual property pertains to CEL-SCIs manufacturing methodologies, certain aspects of which may not be suitable for patent filings and must be protected as trade secrets and/or confidential know-how. This type of information must be protected diligently by CEL-SCI to protect its disclosure to competitors, since legal protections after disclosure may be minimal or non-existent. Accordingly, much of the value of this intellectual property is dependent upon the ability of CEL-SCI to keep its trade secrets and know-how confidential.\nTo protect this type of information against disclosure or appropriation by competitors, CEL-SCIs policy is to require its employees, consultants, contractors and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements with CEL-SCI. However, current or former employees, consultants, contractors and advisers may unintentionally or willfully disclose the confidential information to competitors, and confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Enforcing a claim that a third party obtained illegally, and is using, trade secrets and/or confidential know-how is expensive, time consuming and unpredictable. The enforceability of confidentiality agreements may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nIn addition, in some cases a regulator considering the application for product candidate approval may require the disclosure of some or all of the proprietary information. In such a case, CEL-SCI must decide whether to disclose the information or forego approval in a particular country. If CEL-SCI is unable to market its product candidates in key countries, CEL-SCIs opportunities and value may suffer.\nFailure to obtain or maintain trade secrets and/or confidential know-how trade protection could adversely affect CEL-SCIS competitive position. Moreover, competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and may even apply for patent protection in respect of the same. If successful in obtaining such patent protection, competitors could limit the use of such trade secrets and/or confidential know-how.\nCEL-SCI may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of its patents and other intellectual property.\nCEL-SCI may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in its patents or other intellectual property. CEL-SCI may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing the product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If CEL-SCI fails in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, CEL-SCI may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on its business. Even if CEL-SCI is successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to CEL-SCIs management and employees.\nRisks Related to CEL-SCIs common stock\nFuture equity offerings or other equity issuances may result in dilution to existing shareholders.\nCEL-SCI expects that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue its planned operations. To raise additional capital, CEL-SCI may in the future offer additional shares of its common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for its common stock. To the extent CEL-SCI raises additional capital by issuing equity securities, CEL-SCIs stockholders may experience substantial dilution and new investors could gain rights superior to existing stockholders.\nThe exercise of outstanding warrants and options will cause dilution.\nAs of September 30, 2022, there were outstanding warrants which allow the holders to purchase 1,310,822 shares of common stock, with a weighted average exercise price of $2.97 per share, and outstanding options which allow the holders to purchase up to 12,964,014 shares of common stock, with a weighted average exercise price of $9.06 per share. The exercise of these outstanding warrants and options will cause dilution to holders of our common stock.\nSince CEL-SCI does not intend to pay dividends on its common stock, any potential return to investors will result only from any increases in the price of its common stock.\nAt the present time, CEL-SCI intends to use available funds to finance its operations. Accordingly, while payment of dividends rests within the discretion of its board of directors, no common stock dividends have been declared or paid by CEL-SCI and CEL-SCI has no intention of paying any common stock dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, any future debt financing arrangement may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on CEL-SCIs common stock. Any return to CEL-SCIs shareholders will therefore be limited to appreciation in the price of its common stock, which may never occur. If CEL-SCIs stock price does not increase, CEL-SCIs shareholders are unlikely to receive any return on their investments in CEL-SCIs common stock.\nThe price of CEL-SCIs common stock has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for CEL-SCIs shareholders.\nCEL-SCIs stock price has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. As a result of this volatility, CEL-SCIs shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at or above the price they paid for their shares. The market price for CEL-SCIs common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in CEL-SCIs financial condition and operating results;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in CEL-SCIs growth rate relative to competitors;\n\u00b7\ncompetition from existing products or new products or product candidates that may emerge;\n\u00b7\ndevelopment of new technologies that may make CEL-SCIs technology less attractive;\n\u00b7\nchanges in physician, hospital or healthcare provider practices that may make CEL-SCIs product candidates less useful;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by CEL-SCI, its partners or competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nfailure to meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of the investment community;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nvariations in its financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to CEL-SCI;\n\u00b7\nchanges to coverage and reimbursement levels by commercial third-party payors and government payors, including Medicare, and any announcements relating to reimbursement levels;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u00b7\nthe other factors described in this Risk Factors section.\nCEL-SCI has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could adversely affect CEL-SCIs ability to report its results of operations and financial condition accurately and in a timely manner, which could have an adverse impact on CEL-SCIs business.\nCEL-SCIs management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement in an entitys annual or interim consolidated financial statements might not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs described in Item 9A of this Annual Report, management noted material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. CEL-SCIs management concluded that material weaknesses existed relating to ineffective information technology general controls in the areas of user access and segregation of duties related to certain information technology systems that support CEL-SCIs financial reporting process and ineffective design of certain management review controls across a significant portion of CEL-SCIs financial statement areas, particularly with regard to the precision of the review and evidence of review procedures performed. Although these control weaknesses did not result in any material misstatement of CEL-SCIs financial statements for the periods presented, they could lead to a material misstatement of account balances or disclosures. As a result, CEL-SCIs management concluded that its internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2022.\nIn order to remediate these material weaknesses, CEL-SCI will change certain control activities over financial reporting to include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) evaluating and implementing enhanced process controls around user access management and segregation of duties and (ii) expanding the documentation over user access and system controls and enhancing the level of evidence maintained in managements review controls.\nIf CEL-SCI is unable to remediate the material weaknesses timely and sufficiently or if CEL-SCI identifies future material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting or is unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that its internal control over financial reporting is effective, CEL-SCI may experience a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial statements, incur material misstatements in its financial statements, incur difficulty accessing capital on favorable terms, or at all, be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, incur reputational harm, and the market price of its common stock may be adversely affected.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED SEC COMMENTS\nNone ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nCEL-SCI leases office space at 8229 Boone Blvd., Suite 802, Vienna, Virginia at a monthly rental of approximately $8,000. The lease on the office space expires on November 30, 2025. CEL-SCI believes this arrangement is adequate for the conduct of its present business.\nCEL-SCI has a 17,900 square foot laboratory located in Baltimore, Maryland. The laboratory is leased by CEL-SCI at a cost of approximately $22,000 per month. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the laboratory lease was extended ten years and expires on February 29, 2032.\nIn August 2007, CEL-SCI leased a building near Baltimore, Maryland (the San Tomas lease). The building, which consists of approximately 73,000 square feet, has been remodeled in accordance with CEL-SCIs specifications so that it can be used by CEL-SCI to manufacture Multikine for CEL-SCIs Phase 3 clinical trial and sales of the drug, if approved by the FDA. The lease expires on October 31, 2028 and requires annual base rent payments of approximately $2.5 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. The annual base rent escalates each year at 3% beginning on November 1st. CEL-SCI is also required to pay all real estate and personal property taxes, insurance premiums, maintenance expenses, repair costs and utilities, which were approximately $65,000 per month as of September 30, 2022. The lease allows CEL-SCI, at its election, to extend the lease for two ten-year periods or to purchase the building at the end of the 20-year lease.\nIn August 2020, the Company entered into an amendment to the San Tomas lease agreement under which the landlord agreed to allow the Company to substantially upgrade the manufacturing facility in preparation for the potential commercial production of Multikine. The total cost of the upgrades was $11.1 million. The landlord agreed to finance the final $2.4 million of the costs incurred. The Company started repaying these costs on March 1, 2021 through increased lease payments which will continue over the remaining lease term. The repayment includes a base rent which escalates at 3% each year plus interest that accrues at 13.75% per year on the $2.4 million financed. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nNot applicable. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable. ITEM 5. MARKET FOR CEL-SCI'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.\nAs of September 30, 2022, there were approximately 525 holders of record of CEL-SCIs common stock. CEL-SCIs common stock is traded on the NYSE American under the symbol CVM.\nShown below are the range of high and low quotations for CEL-SCIs common stock for the periods indicated as reported by the NYSE American.\nQuarter Ending\nHigh\nLow\n12/31/2020\n$ 16.70\n$ 10.76\n3/31/2021\n$ 40.91\n$ 11.88\n6/30/2021\n$ 27.86\n$ 8.20\n9/30/2021\n$ 12.90\n$ 7.08\n12/31/2021\n$ 12.82\n$ 7.06\n3/31/2022\n$ 7.73\n$ 3.80\n6/30/2022\n$ 6.14\n$ 2.49\n9/30/2022\n$ 5.42\n$ 3.09\nHolders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends as may be declared by CEL-SCIs Board of Directors out of legally available funds and, in the event of liquidation, to share pro rata in any distribution of CEL-SCIs assets after payment of liabilities. CEL-SCIs Board of Directors is not obligated to declare a dividend. CEL-SCI has not paid any dividends on its common stock and CEL-SCI does not have any current plans to pay any common stock dividends.\nThe provisions in CEL-SCIs Articles of Incorporation relating to CEL-SCIs preferred stock allow CEL-SCIs directors to issue preferred stock with rights to multiple votes per share and dividend rights which would have priority over any dividends paid with respect to CEL-SCIs common stock. The issuance of preferred stock with such rights may make more difficult the removal of management even if such removal would be considered beneficial to shareholders generally, and will have the effect of limiting shareholder participation in certain transactions such as mergers or tender offers if such transactions are not favored by incumbent management.\nThe market price of CEL-SCIs common stock, as well as the securities of other biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, have historically been highly volatile, and the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Factors such as fluctuations in CEL-SCIs operating results, announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products by CEL-SCI or its competitors, governmental regulation, developments in patent or other proprietary rights, public concern as to the safety of products which may be developed by CEL-SCI or other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and general market conditions may have a significant effect on the market price of CEL-SCIs common stock. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\nCEL-SCI is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not required to provide the information required under this item. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.\nMultikine (Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection) which, for simplicity, is referred to in this report as Multikine, is the trademark that the Company has registered for this investigational therapy, and this proprietary name is subject to FDA review under the Companys future anticipated regulatory submission for approval. Multikine has not been licensed or approved by the FDA or any other regulatory agency. Neither has its safety or efficacy been established for any use.\nCEL-SCI also owns and is developing a pre-clinical technology called LEAPS (Ligand Epitope Antigen Presentation System). CEL-SCI is using its LEAPS technology platform to investigate its lead peptide-based immunotherapy (CEL-4000) as a vaccine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.\nAll of CEL-SCIs projects are under development. As a result, CEL-SCI cannot predict when it will be able to generate any revenue from the sale of any of its products.\nSince inception, CEL-SCI has financed its operations through the issuance of equity securities, convertible notes, loans and certain research grants. CEL-SCI will likely continue to generate net operating losses as it continues the development of Multikine and brings other drug candidates into clinical trials. Until such time as CEL-SCI becomes profitable, any or all of these financing vehicles or others may be utilized to assist CEL-SCIs capital requirements.\nResults of Operations\nThe Company incurred a net operating loss of approximately $36.1 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. This net operating loss consists of significant non-cash expenses accounting for approximately 42% of the operating loss. The non-cash operating expenses include approximately $11.4 million in stock-based employee compensation and approximately $3.8 million in depreciation and amortization expense.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, research and development expenses increased by approximately $2.2 million, or 10%, compared to the year ended September 30, 2021. Major components of this increase include approximately $0.5 million increase in employee stock compensation expense, approximately $1.6 million increase in depreciation, primarily related to leasehold improvements to the manufacturing facility that were placed in service in October 2021, an increase of approximately $1.2 million of costs incurred to prepare for the potential commercial sale of Multikine, and an increase of approximately $0.2 million in other miscellaneous research and development expenses. These increases were offset by a decrease of approximately $1.3 million in costs related to the Phase 3 clinical study.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $2.4 million, or 18%, compared to the year ended September 30, 2021. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in employee stock compensation expense of approximately $2.8 million offset by a $0.4 million increase in other net general and administrative expenses.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, CEL-SCI recorded a derivative gain of approximately $0.4 million and a loss of approximately $0.7 million, respectively. This variation was the result of the change in fair value of the derivative liabilities during the period which was caused by fluctuations in the share price of CEL-SCIs common stock.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, other non-operating gain decreased by approximately $1.7 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2021 resulting in a loss of approximately $31,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. This gain for the year ended September 30, 2021 relates to the Securities Purchase Agreement (SPA) described in Note 12 to the financial statements included as part of this report. Under the SPA, the Company issued Ergomed shares of common stock and the net proceeds from the sales of those shares reduces outstanding amounts due Ergomed. Upon issuance, the Company expensed the full value of the shares as other non-operating gain/loss and subsequently offset the gain or loss as amounts were realized through the sale by Ergomed and reduced accounts payable to Ergomed. The amount of the gain or loss is a result of the timing of shares issued to Ergomed and the subsequent re-sale of those shares. There was no activity under the agreement during the year ended September 30, 2022. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company realized approximately $1.7 million in value upon the resale of shares. Ergomed resold the final balance of shares issued in the quarter ended September 30, 2021.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nCEL-SCIs research and development efforts involved Multikine and LEAPS. The table below shows the research and development expenses associated with each project during the reporting periods.\nYear ended September 30,\nMultikine\n$ 24,251,629\n$ 21,508,026\nLEAPS\n1,103,717\n1,600,871\nTotal research and development\n$ 25,355,346\n$ 23,108,897\nCEL-SCIs Phase 3 clinical trial began in December 2010 after the completion and validation of CEL-SCIs dedicated manufacturing facility. The Phase 3 clinical trial was fully enrolled in September 2016, reached its primary endpoint in April 2020 and achieved database lock in December 2020. The data was unblinded in June 2021, the primary endpoint results were announced in June 2021, additional data was presented at ASCO 2022 and ESMO 2022 in June 2022 and September 2022, respectively. CEL-SCI is currently preparing the BLA to submit to the FDA.\nAs explained in Item 1 of this report, clinical and other studies necessary to obtain regulatory approval of a new drug involve significant costs and require several years to complete. The extent of the Companys clinical trials and research programs are primarily based upon the amount of capital available to the Company and the extent to which the Company has received regulatory approvals for clinical trials. The inability of the Company to conduct clinical trials or research, whether due to a lack of capital or regulatory approval, will prevent the Company from completing the studies and research required to obtain regulatory approval for any products which the Company is developing. Without regulatory approval, the Company will be unable to sell any of its products. Since all of the Companys projects are under development, the Company cannot predict when it will be able to generate any revenue from the sale of any of its products.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCEL-SCI has had only limited revenues from operations since its inception in March 1983. CEL-SCI has relied primarily upon capital generated from the public and private offerings of its common stock and convertible notes. In addition, CEL-SCI has utilized short-term loans to meet its capital requirements. Capital raised by CEL-SCI has been used to acquire an exclusive worldwide license to use, and later purchase, certain patented and unpatented proprietary technology and know-how relating to the human immunological defense system and for clinical trials. Capital has also been used for patent applications, debt repayment, research and development, administrative costs, and for CEL-SCIs laboratory and manufacturing facilities. CEL-SCI does not anticipate realizing significant revenues until it enters into licensing arrangements regarding its technology and know-how or until it receives regulatory approval to sell its products (which could take a number of years). As a result, CEL-SCI has been dependent primarily upon the proceeds from the sale of its securities to meet all of its liquidity and capital requirements and anticipates having to do so in the future. During fiscal years 2022 and 2021, CEL-SCI raised net proceeds of approximately $0.1 million and $54.0 million, respectively, through a combination of the sale of common stock and the exercise of warrants and options.\nIn August 2007, CEL-SCI leased a building near Baltimore, Maryland. The building, which consists of approximately 73,000 square feet, has been remodeled in accordance with CEL-SCIs specifications so that it can be used by CEL-SCI to manufacture Multikine for CEL-SCIs Phase III clinical trials and sales of the drug if approved by the FDA. The lease expires on October 31, 2028, and required annual base rent payments of approximately $2.5 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. See Item 2 of this report for more information concerning the terms of this lease.\nIn June 2021, the Company sold 1,400,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $22.62 per share and received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $29.4 million. Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement the Company granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 210,000 shares of common stock solely to cover over-allotments. The underwriter fully exercised this option in June 2021 resulting in additional net proceeds to the Company of approximately $4.4 million.\nIn December 2020, the Company sold 1,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $14.65 per share and received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $13.6 million.\nThe following charts list the warrants that were exercised and the proceeds received during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nFiscal Year 2022\nWarrants\nWarrants Exercised\nExercise Price\nProceeds\nSeries CC\n15,205\n$ 5.00\n$ 76,025\nSeries NN\n10,000\n$ 2.52\n25,200\n25,205\n$ 101,225\nFiscal Year 2021\nWarrants\nWarrants Exercised\nExercise Price\nProceeds\nSeries Z\n79,200\n$ 13.75\n$ 1,089,000\nSeries ZZ\n20,000\n$ 13.75\n275,000\nSeries AA\n100,000\n$ 13.75\n1,375,000\nSeries CC\n132,798\n$ 5.00\n663,990\nSeries MM\n464,201\n$ 1.86\n863,414\nSeries NN\n138,755\n$ 2.52\n349,663\nSeries RR\n165,888\n$ 1.65\n273,715\nSeries SS\n126,064\n$ 2.09\n263,474\nSeries TT\n370,964\n$ 2.24\n830,959\n1,597,870\n$ 5,984,215\nCEL-SCI entered into Securities Purchase Agreements (SPAs) with Ergomed plc, one of CEL-SCIs Clinical Research Organizations responsible for managing the Phase 3 clinical trial, to facilitate payment of amounts due Ergomed. Under the Agreements, CEL-SCI issued Ergomed shares of common stock and the net proceeds from the sales of those shares reduces outstanding amounts due Ergomed. Upon issuance, CEL-SCI expensed the full value of the shares as other non-operating gain/loss and subsequently offsets the expense as amounts were realized through the sale by Ergomed and reduced accounts payable to Ergomed.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, CEL-SCI did not issue Ergomed any shares of common stock. Additionally, no shares were sold during the year ended September 30, 2022. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the company recorded other non-operating gains of approximately $1.7 million upon the resale of shares from the SPA.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, Ergomed had no shares remaining for resale.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company used approximately $19.6 million, or approximately $1.6 million per month, in cash, after considering the maturity and transfer to cash of the remaining $6.2 million in U.S. Treasury bills (T-bills). Significant components of this decrease include cash used to fund the Companys regular operations of approximately $18.2 million, the purchase of property and equipment for approximately $0.6 million, approximately $0.2 million in share issuance costs and approximately $1.4 million in lease payments. These outflows are offset by approximately $0.8 million in lease incentives received from the landlord to partially offset costs of the manufacturing facility upgrade.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, 25,205 warrants were exercised at a weighted average exercise price of $4.02 for total proceeds of approximately $0.1 million.\nPrepaid expenses decreased by approximately $0.2 million during the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to September 30, 2021 primarily due to the timing of payments and recognition of related expenses relating to the Companys Phase 3 clinical trial status.\nSupplies are purchased for use in the Companys manufacturing and R&D efforts. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the supplies increased by approximately $0.2 million in support of the work to validate and prepare the manufacturing facility to produce Multikine for commercial purposes and before the Companys Biologics License Application (BLA) can be submitted to the FDA.\nPrimarily as a result of CEL-SCIs losses incurred to date, its expected continued future losses, and limited cash balances, CEL-SCI has included a disclosure in its financial statements expressing substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. CEL-SCI has included this disclosure on numerous occasions in the preceding years.\nFuture Capital Requirements\nCEL-SCIs material capital commitments include funding operating losses, funding its research and development program and making required lease payments. Additionally, the Company recently completed upgrading the manufacturing facility to prepare for the potential commercial production of Multikine. Total costs of this upgrade were approximately $11.1 million. The landlord of the property agreed to finance the final $2.4 million of costs and allow for the repayment through increased lease payments which began on March 1, 2021. As of September 30, 2022, the landlord had provided approximately all $2.4 million of the agreed funding. Because of the change in lease payments, the new financing arrangement was considered a lease modification.\nFor information on employment contracts, see Item 11 of this report.\nFurther, CEL-SCI has contingent obligations with vendors for work that will be completed in relation to the Phase 3 trial. The timing of these obligations cannot be determined at this time. CEL-SCI estimates it will incur additional expenses of approximately $0.6 million for the filing of the clinical study report with the FDA. It should be noted that this estimate is based only on the information currently available from the CROs responsible for managing the Phase 3 clinical trial and does not include other related costs, e.g., the manufacturing of the drug.\nCEL-SCI will need to raise additional funds, either through the exercise of outstanding warrants/options, through debt or equity financings or a partnering arrangement, to bring Multikine to market. The ability of CEL-SCI to complete the necessary clinical trials and obtain FDA approval for the sale of products to be developed on a commercial basis is uncertain. However, it is possible that CEL-SCI will not be able to generate enough cash to continue operations at its current level. CEL-SCIs management has engaged in fundraising for over 25 years and believes that the manner in which it is proceeding will produce the best possible outcome for the shareholders. There can be no assurances that CEL-SCI will be successful in raising additional funds.\nClinical and other studies necessary to obtain regulatory approval of a new drug involve significant costs and require several years to complete. The extent of CEL-SCIs clinical trials and research programs are primarily based upon the amount of capital available to CEL-SCI and the extent to which CEL-SCI has received regulatory approvals for clinical trials. The inability of CEL-SCI to conduct clinical trials or research, whether due to a lack of capital or regulatory approval, will prevent CEL-SCI from completing the studies and research required to obtain regulatory approval for any products which CEL-SCI is developing. Without regulatory approval, CEL-SCI will be unable to sell any of its products.\nIn the absence of revenues, CEL-SCI will be required to raise additional funds through the sale of securities, debt financings or other arrangements in order to continue with its research efforts. However, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available or be available on favorable terms. Ultimately, CEL-SCI must complete the development of its products, obtain appropriate regulatory approvals and obtain sufficient revenues to support its cost structure.\nSince all of CEL-SCIs projects are under development, CEL-SCI cannot predict with any certainty the funds required for future research and clinical trials, the timing of future research and development projects, or when it will be able to generate any revenue from the sale of any of its products.\nCEL-SCI's cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates on its bank accounts, and, to an immaterial extent, foreign currency exchange rates.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCEL-SCI's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to the financial statements included as part of this report. However, certain accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of CEL-SCIs financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgments by management. As a result, the financial statements are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying those policies, management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. These estimates are based on CEL-SCI's historical experience, terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the industry and information available from outside sources, as appropriate.\nManagement believes that the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates with respect to the preparation of CEL-SCIs financial statements.\nLease Accounting -The measurement of the finance and operating lease right-of-use asset and lease liabilities requires the determination of an estimated lease term and an incremental borrowing rate, which involves complex judgment by management. The determination of the incremental borrowing rates for new and modified lease contracts is a critical accounting policy. Significant judgment is required by management to develop inputs and assumptions used to determine the incremental borrowing rate for lease contracts.\nShare-based Compensation- Share-based compensation cost to employees is measured at fair value as of the grant date in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718. The fair value of the stock options is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires various judgmental assumptions including volatility and expected option life. The compensation cost is recognized as expense over the requisite service or vesting period. Performance-based options are valued using a Monte-Carlo simulation model, which requires inputs based on estimates, including the likelihood of the occurrence of performance and market conditions, volatility and expected option life.\nDerivative Instruments- CEL-SCI enters into financing arrangements that consist of freestanding derivative instruments or hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivative features. CEL-SCI accounts for these arrangements in accordance with ASC 815, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as well as related interpretations of these standards. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), derivative instruments and hybrid instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and are measured at fair value with gains or losses recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the derivative or hybrid instruments. Fair value is generally calculated using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Embedded derivatives that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract are bifurcated and recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either a gain or loss in earnings if they can be reliably measured. When the fair value of embedded derivative features cannot be reliably measured, CEL-SCI measures and reports the entire hybrid instrument at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either a gain or loss in earnings.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNot applicable ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the direction and with the participation of CEL-SCIs management, including CEL-SCIs Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, CEL-SCI carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022. CEL-SCI maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and regulations, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to CEL-SCIs management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. CEL-SCIs disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance of reaching its desired disclosure control objectives.\nCEL-SCIs Chief Executive and Principal Financial Officer has concluded that, due to the material weaknesses described below, CEL-SCIs disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2022.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nCEL-SCIs management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of CEL-SCIs principal executive officer and principal financial officer and implemented by CEL-SCIs Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of CEL-SCIs financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including CEL-SCIs Chief Executive and Principal Financial Officer, CEL-SCI evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or the COSO Framework. Managements assessment included an evaluation of the design of CEL-SCIs internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls. CEL-SCI's Chief Executive and Financial Officer concluded that as of such date, CEL-SCI's internal controls over financial reporting were not effective.\nMaterial Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA material weakness (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of CEL-SCIs annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. CEL-SCIs management concluded that a material weakness existed as of September 30, 2022 relating to ineffective information technology general controls in the areas of user access and segregation of duties related to certain information technology systems that support our financial reporting process. As a result, certain activity level controls were also deemed to be ineffective that are dependent on information derived from these information technology systems.\nIn addition, we identified a material weakness related to the ineffective design of certain management review controls across a significant portion of the Companys financial statement areas, particularly with regard to the precision of the review and evidence of review procedures performed.\nRemediation of Material Weaknesses\nIn order to remediate these material weaknesses, CEL-SCI will change certain control activities over financial reporting to include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) evaluating and implementing enhanced process controls around user access management and segregation of duties and (ii) expanding the documentation over user access and system controls and enhancing the level of evidence maintained in management review controls.\nCEL-SCI is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and implementing measures designed to help ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses are remediated as soon as possible.\nNotwithstanding the material weaknesses described above, CEL-SCIs management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with GAAP.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, CEL-SCI implemented additional controls over financial reporting which include a thorough review of all leases and relevant accounting guidance such that the accounting for any leases complies with U.S. GAAP.\nOther than as described above, there have been no other changes in CEL-SCIs internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, CEL-SCIs internal control over financial reporting.

CEL-SCIs Chief Executive Officer is not the Chairman of CEL-SCIs Board of Directors.\nCEL-SCIs Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility to evaluate and respond to risks facing CEL-SCI. CEL-SCIs Board of Directors fulfills its obligations in this regard by meeting on a regular basis and communicating, when necessary, with CEL-SCIs officers.\nDr. Peter R. Young, Bruno Baillavoine, Robert Watson, and Dr. Gail Naughton are independent directors as that term is defined in section 803 of the listing standards of the NYSE American.\nCEL-SCI has adopted a Code of Ethics which is applicable to CEL-SCIS principal executive, financial, and accounting officers and persons performing similar functions. The Code of Ethics is available on CEL-SCIs website, located at www.cel-sci.com.\nIf a violation of this code of ethics act is discovered or suspected, any person (anonymously, if desired) may send a detailed note, with relevant documents, to CEL-SCIs Audit Committee, c/o Dr. Peter Young, 208 Hewitt Drive, Suite 103-143, Waco, TX 76712.\nFor purposes of electing directors at its annual meeting, CEL-SCI has a nominating committee that is made up of CEL-SCIs independent directors. The nominating committee selects the nominees to the Board of Directors which are subject to election by CEL-SCIs shareholders.\nCEL-SCI does not have any policy regarding the consideration of director candidates recommended by shareholders and under Colorado law, any shareholder can nominate a person for election as a director at the annual shareholders meeting. However, CEL-SCIs Board of Directors will consider candidates recommended by shareholders. To submit a candidate for the Board of Directors the shareholder should send the name, address and telephone number of the candidate, together with any relevant background or biographical information, to CEL-SCIs Chief Executive Officer, at the address shown on the cover page of this report. The Board has not established any specific qualifications or skills a nominee must meet to serve as a director. Although the Board does not have any process for identifying and evaluating director nominees, the Board does not believe there would be any differences in the manner in which the Board evaluates nominees submitted by shareholders as opposed to nominees submitted by any other person.\nCEL-SCI does not have a policy with regard to Board members attendance at annual meetings. All Board members attended the last annual shareholders meeting held on June 13, 2022.\nHolders of CEL-SCIs common stock can send written communications to CEL-SCIs entire Board of Directors, or to one or more Board members, by addressing the communication to the Board of Directors or to one or more directors, specifying the director or directors by name, and sending the communication to CEL-SCIs offices in Vienna, Virginia. Communications addressed to the Board of Directors as whole will be delivered to each Board member. Communications addressed to a specific director (or directors) will be delivered to the director (or directors) specified.\nA security holder communication not sent to the Board of Directors as a whole is not relayed to Board members which did not receive the communication. ITEM 11.EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nComponents of Compensation - Executive Officers\nCEL-SCIs executive officers are compensated through the following three components:\n\u00b7\nBase Salary\n\u00b7\nLong-Term Incentives (LTIs) (stock options and/or grants of stock)\n\u00b7\nBenefits\nThese components provide a balanced mix of base compensation and compensation that is contingent upon each executive officers individual performance. A goal of the compensation program is to provide executive officers with a reasonable level of security through base salary and benefits. CEL-SCI wants to ensure that the compensation programs are appropriately designed to encourage executive officer retention and motivation to create shareholder value. The Compensation Committee believes that CEL-SCIs stockholders are best served when CEL-SCI can attract and retain talented executives by providing compensation packages that are competitive but fair.\nBase Salaries\nBase salaries generally have been targeted to be competitive when compared to the salary levels of persons holding similar positions in other pharmaceutical companies and other publicly traded companies of comparable size. Each executive officers respective responsibilities, experience, expertise and individual performance are considered.\nA further consideration in establishing compensation for the senior employees is their long term history with CEL-SCI. Taken into consideration are factors that have helped CEL-SCI survive in times when it was financially weak, such as: willingness to accept salary cuts, willingness not to be paid at all for extended time periods, and in general an attitude that helped CEL-SCI survive during financially difficult times.\nLong-Term Incentives\nStock grants and option grants help to align the interests of CEL-SCIs employees with those of its shareholders. Options and stock grants are made under CEL-SCIs Stock Option, Incentive Stock Bonus, Stock Bonus and Stock Compensation Plans. Options are granted with exercise prices equal to the closing price of CEL-SCIs common stock on the day immediately preceding the date of grant, with pro rata vesting at the end of each of the following three years.\nCEL-SCI believes that grants of equity-based compensation:\n\u00b7\nEnhance the link between the creation of shareholder value and long-term executive incentive compensation;\n\u00b7\nProvide focus, motivation and retention incentive; and\n\u00b7\nProvide competitive levels of total compensation.\nBenefits\nIn addition to cash and equity compensation programs, executive officers participate in the health and welfare benefit programs available to other employees. In a few limited circumstances, CEL-SCI provides other benefits to certain executive officers, such as car allowances.\nAll executive officers are eligible to participate in CEL-SCIs 401(k) plan on the same basis as its other employees. CEL-SCI matches 100% of each employees contribution up to 6% of his or her salary.\nThe following table sets forth in summary form the compensation received by (i) the Chief Executive and Financial Officer of CEL-SCI and (ii) by each other executive officer of CEL-SCI who received in excess of $100,000 during the two fiscal years ended September 30, 2022.\nName and Principal Position\nFiscal Year\nSalary (1)\nBonus (2)\nStock Awards (3)\nOption Awards (4)\nAll Other Compensation\n(5)\nTotal\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nGeert R.

The value of all stock awarded during the periods covered by the table is calculated according to ASC 718-10-30-3 which represented the grant date fair value.\n(4)\nThe fair value of all stock options granted during the periods covered by the table are calculated on the grant date in accordance with ASC 718-10-30-3 which represented the grant date fair value.\n(5)\nAll other compensation received that CEL-SCI could not properly report in any other column of the table including the dollar value of any insurance premiums paid by, or on behalf of, CEL-SCI with respect to term life insurance for the benefit of the named executive officer and car allowances paid by CEL-SCI. Includes board of directors fees for Mr. Kersten.\nEmployee Pension, Profit Sharing or Other Retirement Plans\nCEL-SCI has a defined contribution retirement plan, qualifying under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and covering substantially all CEL-SCIs employees. CEL-SCIs contribution to the plan is made in shares of CEL-SCI's common stock. Each participant's contribution is matched by CEL-SCI with shares of common stock which have a value equal to 100% of the participant's contribution, not to exceed the lesser of $10,000 or 6% of the participant's total compensation. CEL-SCI's contribution of common stock is valued each quarter based upon the closing price of its common stock. The fiscal 2022 expenses for this plan were approximately $6,000.

The employment agreement with Mr. Kersten, which is essentially the same as Mr. Kerstens prior employment agreement, as amended on August 30, 2016, provides that, during the term of the agreement, CEL-SCI would pay Mr. Kersten an annual salary of $559,052, plus any increases in proportion to salary increases granted to other senior executive officers of CEL-SCI, as well any increases approved by the Board of Directors during the term of the employment agreement.\nDuring the employment term, Mr. Kersten will be entitled to receive any other benefits which are provided to CEL-SCI's executive officers or other full time employees in accordance with CEL-SCI's policies and practices and subject to Mr. Kerstens satisfaction of any applicable conditions of eligibility.\nIf Mr. Kersten resigns after the occurrence of any of the following events:(i) a reduction in Mr. Kerstens salary(ii) a relocation (or demand for relocation) of Mr. Kerstens place of employment to a location more than ten(10) miles from his current place of employment, (iii) a significant and material reduction in Mr. Kerstens authority, job duties or level of responsibility or the imposition of significant and material limitations on Mr. Kerstens autonomy in his position, or (iv) a Change in Control, then the employment agreement will be terminated and Mr. Kersten will be entitled to receive a lump-sum payment from CEL-SCI equal to 24 months of salary ($1,232,710) and the unvested portion of any stock options would vest immediately. For purposes of the employment agreement a change in the control of CEL-SCI means: (1) the merger of CEL-SCI with another entity if after such merger the shareholders of CEL-SCI do not own at least 50% of voting capital stock of the surviving corporation; (2) the sale of substantially all of the assets of CEL-SCI; (3) the acquisition by any person of more than 50% of CEL-SCI's common stock; or (4) a change in a majority of CEL-SCI's directors which has not been approved by the incumbent directors.\nThe employment agreement will also terminate upon the death of Mr. Kersten or Mr. Kerstens physical or mental disability. If the employment agreement is terminated for any of these reasons, Mr. Kersten, or his legal representatives, as the case may be, will be paid the salary provided by the employment agreement through the date of termination, any options or bonus shares of CEL-SCI then held by Mr. Kersten will become fully vested and the expiration date of any options which would expire during the four year period following his termination of employment will be extended to the date which is four years after his termination of employment. The employment agreement will also terminate upon the willful misconduct, an act of fraud against CEL-SCI, or a breach of the employment agreement by Mr. Kersten, in which case Mr. Kersten will be paid the salary provided by the employment agreement through the date of termination.\nPatricia B. Prichep / Eyal Talor, Ph.D.\nOn August 31, 2019, CEL-SCI entered into a four-year employment agreement with Patricia B. Prichep, CEL-SCIs Senior Vice President of Operations. The employment agreement with Ms. Prichep, which is essentially the same as Ms. Pricheps prior employment agreement entered into on August 30, 2016 provides that, during the term of the agreement, CEL-SCI would pay Ms. Prichep an annual salary of $245,804 plus any increases approved by the Board of Directors during the period of the employment agreement.\nOn August 31, 2019, CEL-SCI entered into a four-year employment agreement with Eyal Talor, Ph.D., CEL-SCIs Chief Scientific Officer. The employment agreement with Dr. Talor, which is essentially the same as Dr. Talors prior employment agreement entered into on August 30, 2016, provides that, during the term of the agreement, CEL-SCI would pay Dr. Talor an annual salary of $303,453 plus any increases approved by the Board of Directors during the period of the employment agreement.\nIf Ms. Prichep or Dr. Talor resigns after the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) a relocation (or demand for relocation) of employees place of employment to a location more than ten (10) miles from the employees current place of employment, (ii) a significant and material reduction in the employees authority, job duties or level of responsibility, (iii) the imposition of significant and material limitations on the employees autonomy in her or his position, or (iv) there is a change in the control of CEL-SCI, the employment agreements with Ms. Prichep and Dr. Talor allow Ms. Prichep and/or Dr. Talor (as the case may be) to resign from her or his position at CEL-SCI and receive a lump-sum payment from CEL-SCI equal to 18 months of salary ($406,498 and $501,836 respectively). In addition, the unvested portion of any stock options held by the employee will vest immediately. For purposes of the employment agreements, a change in the control of CEL-SCI means: (1) the merger of CEL-SCI with another entity if after such merger the shareholders of CEL-SCI do not own at least 50% of voting capital stock of the surviving corporation; (2) the sale of substantially all of the assets of CEL-SCI; (3) the acquisition by any person of more than 50% of CEL-SCI's common stock; or (4) a change in a majority of CEL-SCI's directors which has not been approved by the incumbent directors.\nThe employment agreements with Ms. Prichep and Dr. Talor will also terminate upon the death of the employee, the employees physical or mental disability, willful misconduct, an act of fraud against CEL-SCI, or a breach of the employment agreement by the employee. If the employment agreement is terminated for any of these reasons the employee, or her or his legal representatives, as the case may be, will be paid the salary provided by the employment agreement through the date of termination.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nCEL-SCI has a compensation committee comprised of Mr. Bruno Baillavoine, Dr. Peter Young and Mr. Robert Watson, all of whom are independent directors.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, no director of CEL-SCI was also an executive officer of another entity which had an executive officer of CEL-SCI serving as a director of such entity or as a member of the compensation committee of such entity.\nStock Option, Bonus and Compensation Plans\nCEL-SCI has Incentive Stock Option Plans, Non-Qualified Stock Option Plans, Stock Bonus Plans, Stock Compensation Plans and an Incentive Stock Bonus Plan. All Stock Option, Bonus and Compensation Plans have been approved by the stockholders. A summary description of these Plans follows. In some cases these Plans are collectively referred to as the \"Plans\".\nIncentive Stock Option Plans. The Incentive Stock Option Plans authorize the issuance of shares of CEL-SCI's common stock to persons who exercise options granted pursuant to the Plans. Only CEL-SCIs employees may be granted options pursuant to the Incentive Stock Option Plans.\nOptions may not be exercised until one year following the date of grant. Options granted to an employee then owning more than 10% of the common stock of CEL-SCI may not be exercisable by its terms after five years from the date of grant. Any other option granted pursuant to the Plans may not be exercisable by its terms after ten years from the date of grant.\nThe option exercise price is determined by CEL-SCIs Compensation Committee but cannot be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant of the option (or 110% of the fair market value in the case of a person owning more than 10% of CEL-SCI's outstanding shares).\nNon-Qualified Stock Option Plans. The Non-Qualified Stock Option Plans authorize the issuance of shares of CEL-SCI's common stock to persons that exercise options granted pursuant to the Plans. CEL-SCI's employees, directors, officers, consultants and advisors are eligible to be granted options pursuant to the Plans, provided however that bona fide services must be rendered by such consultants or advisors and such services must not be in connection with a capital-raising transaction or promoting CEL-SCIs common stock. The option exercise price is determined by CEL-SCIs Compensation Committee.\nStock Bonus Plans. Under the Stock Bonus Plans, shares of CEL-SCIs common stock may be issued to CEL-SCI's employees, directors, officers, consultants and advisors, provided however that bona fide services must be rendered by consultants or advisors and such services must not be in connection with a capital-raising transaction or promoting CEL-SCIs common stock.\nStock Compensation Plans. Under the Stock Compensation Plans, shares of CEL-SCIs common stock may be issued to CEL-SCIs employees, directors, officers, consultants and advisors in payment of salaries, fees and other compensation owed to these persons. However, bona fide services must be rendered by consultants or advisors and such services must not be in connection with a capital-raising transaction or promoting CEL-SCIs common stock.\nIncentive Stock Bonus Plan. Under the 2014 Incentive Stock Bonus Plan, shares of CEL-SCIs common stock may be issued to executive officers and other employees who contribute significantly to the success of CEL-SCI. The purpose of the Plan is to provide long term incentive for outstanding service to CEL-SCI and its shareholders, to assist in recruiting and retaining people of outstanding ability and initiative in executive and management positions to allow officers and employees to participate in CEL-SCI's future prosperity and growth, and to align the interests of CEL-SCI's officers and employees with those of its shareholders.\nOther Information Regarding the Plans. The Plans are administered by CEL-SCI's Compensation Committee (the Committee), each member of which is a director of CEL-SCI. The members of the Committee were selected by CEL-SCI's Board of Directors and serve for a one-year tenure and until their successors are elected. A member of the Committee may be removed at any time by action of the Board of Directors. Any vacancies which may occur on the Committee will be filled by the Board of Directors. The Committee is vested with the authority to interpret the provisions of the Plans and supervise the administration of the Plans. In addition, the Committee is empowered to select those persons to whom shares or options are to be granted, to determine the number of shares subject to each grant of a stock bonus or an option and to determine when, and upon what conditions, shares or options granted under the Plans will vest or otherwise be subject to forfeiture and cancellation.\nIn the discretion of the Committee, any option granted pursuant to the Plans may include installment exercise terms such that the option becomes fully exercisable in a series of cumulating portions. The Committee may also accelerate the date upon which any option (or any part of any options) is first exercisable. Any shares issued pursuant to the Stock Bonus Plans or Stock Compensation Plans and any options granted pursuant to the Incentive Stock Option Plans or the Non-Qualified Stock Option Plans will be forfeited if the \"vesting\" schedule established by the Committee administering the Plans at the time of the grant is not met. For this purpose, vesting means the period during which the employee must remain an employee of CEL-SCI or the period of time a non-employee must provide services to CEL-SCI. At the time an employee ceases working for CEL-SCI (or at the time a non-employee ceases to perform services for CEL-SCI), any shares or options not fully vested will be forfeited and cancelled. At the discretion of the Committee payment for the shares of common stock underlying options may be paid through the delivery of shares of CEL-SCI's common stock having an aggregate fair market value equal to the option price, provided such shares have been owned by the option holder for at least one year prior to such exercise. A combination of cash and shares of common stock may also be permitted at the discretion of the Committee.\nOptions are generally non-transferable except upon the death of the option holder. Shares issued pursuant to the Stock Bonus Plans will generally not be transferable until the person receiving the shares satisfies the vesting requirements imposed by the Committee when the shares were issued.\nThe Board of Directors of CEL-SCI may at any time, and from time to time, amend, terminate, or suspend one or more of the Plans in any manner it deems appropriate, provided that such amendment, termination or suspension may not adversely affect rights or obligations with respect to shares or options previously granted.\nDuring fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, CEL-SCI granted 250,000 performance-based stock options from the 2020 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan to officers. Each option entitles the holder to purchase one share of CEL-SCIs common stock at a price of $10.48 per share, the fair value on the date of issuance. The stock options will vest 100% upon approval of the first marketing application for any pharmaceutical based upon CEL-SCIs Multikine technology in any of the USA, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, or Australia. None of the options will be exercisable before November 19, 2022. All options which have not vested as of November 18, 2031 will be canceled.\nStock Options\nThe following table shows information concerning the options granted during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 to the persons named below:\nOptions Granted\nName\nGrant Date\nOptions Granted\nPrice Per Share\nExpiration Date\nGeert Kersten\n11/19/2021\n50,000\n$ 10.48\n11/18/2031\n6/13/2022\n250,000\n$ 3.35\n6/12/2032\nPatricia Prichep\n11/19/2021\n50,000\n$ 10.48\n11/18/2031\n6/13/2022\n167,000\n$ 3.35\n6/12/2032\nEyal Talor\n11/19/2021\n50,000\n$ 10.48\n11/18/2031\n6/13/2022\n182,000\n$ 3.35\n6/12/2032\nDan Zimmerman\n11/19/2021\n50,000\n$ 10.48\n11/18/2031\n6/13/2022\n80,000\n$ 3.35\n6/12/2032\nJohn Cipriano\n11/19/2021\n50,000\n$ 10.48\n11/18/2031\n6/13/2022\n65,000\n$ 3.35\n6/12/2032\nBruno Baillavoine\n6/13/2022\n64,000\n$ 3.35\n6/12/2032\nPeter Young\n6/13/2022\n64,000\n$ 3.35\n6/12/2032\nRobert Watson\n6/13/2022\n64,000\n$ 3.35\n6/12/2032\nGail Naughton\n8/2/2022\n64,000\n$ 3.61\n8/1/2032\nThe following table shows the outstanding options held by the persons named below on September 30, 2022:\nShares underlying unexercised\nOption which are:\nExercise\nExpiration\nName\nExercisable\nUnexercisable\nPrice\nDate\nGeert R.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern Uncertainty\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has future liquidity needs that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of Liquidity\nAs described in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has experienced recurring losses. The Company expects to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future. Further, the Company has spent, and expects to continue to spend, a substantial amount of funds in connection with implementing its business strategy, including planned product development efforts, clinical trials and research and discovery efforts. The Company is dependent on its ability to raise additional funding from the capital markets in order to continue to fund its operations.\nWe identified managements evaluation of the Companys liquidity as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments and assumptions used by management in (i) preparing its forecast of cash expenditures to support the Companys drug development and clinical trials, and (ii) providing complete and accurate disclosures related to the Companys liquidity. Auditing these judgments and assumptions involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n\u00b7\nAssessing the reasonableness of managements key assumptions in forecasting cash expenditures by comparing the key assumptions to (i) historical forecasts and (ii) the Companys ongoing drug development pipeline.\n\u00b7\nTesting the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the forecasted cash expenditures by (i) inspecting contractual arrangements with third-party clinical research organizations and suppliers, and (ii) considering current and past expenditures in evaluating the forecasted fixed and variable costs.\n\u00b7\nEvaluating the adequacy of managements disclosure in the financial statements regarding the Companys liquidity by comparing the disclosure to other audit evidence obtained to determine whether such evidence is consistent with or contradictory to the Companys liquidity disclosure.\n/s/BDO USA, LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2005.\nPotomac, Maryland\nDecember 27, 2022\nCEL-SCI CORPORATION\nBALANCE SHEETS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 22,672,138\n$ 36,060,148\nU.S. Treasury Bills\n-\n6,151,385\nReceivables\n-\n54,922\nPrepaid expenses\n762,063\n998,482\nSupplies used for R&D and manufacturing\n2,001,715\n2,006,584\nTotal current assets\n25,435,916\n45,271,521\nFinance lease right of use assets\n10,937,797\n12,691,921\nOperating lease right of use assets\n1,884,464\n2,056,178\nProperty and equipment, net\n11,889,029\n13,663,562\nPatent costs, net\n212,201\n275,866\nDeposits\n-\n1,910,917\nSupplies used for R&D and manufacturing\n164,299\n-\nTotal assets\n$ 50,523,706\n$ 75,869,965\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$ 1,618,290\n$ 1,675,813\nAccrued expenses\n842,492\n859,216\nDue to employees\n471,488\n265,993\nDerivative instruments, current portion\n-\n437,380\nLease liabilities, current portion\n1,731,481\n698,665\nTotal current liabilities\n4,663,751\n3,937,067\nFinance lease liabilities, net of current portion\n11,721,368\n13,252,364\nOperating lease liabilities, net of current portion\n1,850,380\n2,021,308\nOther liabilities\n125,000\n125,000\nTotal liabilities\n18,360,499\n19,335,739\nSTOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCommon stock, $0.01 par value -

The Company has announced results from its Phase 3 study for its lead investigational therapy, Multikine\u00ae (Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection), involving head and neck cancer, for which the Company has received Orphan Drug Status from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Unlike other immune therapies, Multikine is administered locally at the site of the tumor as a first line treatment right after diagnosis, before surgery and radiation. The goal is to help the intact immune system kill the micro metastases that usually cause recurrence of the cancer to improve outcomes and better overall survival rates for patients suffering from head and neck cancer.\nCEL-SCI is also investigating a peptide-based immunotherapy (CEL-4000) as a vaccine for rheumatoid arthritis using its LEAPS technology platform. CEL-SCI is in the process of completing pre-IND studies for CEL-4000.\n2.\nLIQUIDITY\nThe Company has incurred significant costs since its inception for the acquisition of certain proprietary technology and scientific knowledge relating to the human immunological defense system, patent applications, research and development, administrative costs, construction and expansion of manufacturing and laboratory facilities and participation in clinical trials. The Company has funded such costs primarily with proceeds from loans and the public and private sale of its securities. The Company will be required to raise additional capital or find additional long-term financing to continue with its efforts to bring Multikine to market. The ability to raise capital may be dependent upon market conditions that are outside the control of the Company. The ability of the Company to obtain approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the sale of products to be developed on a commercial basis is uncertain. Ultimately, the Company must complete the development of its products, obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals and obtain sufficient revenues to support its cost structure. The Company believes there is a high likelihood that it will continue to receive funds from private and public offerings and warrant exercises similar to the way it has funded operations in the past. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient capital to support its operations.\nTo finance the Company through marketing approval, the Company plans to raise additional capital in the form of warrant exercises, corporate partnerships, and debt and/or equity financings. The Company believes that it will be able to obtain additional financing because it has done so consistently in the past and because it showed great survival benefit in the Phase 3 study in one of the two treatment arms for advanced primary head and neck cancer. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising additional funds on a timely basis or that the funds will be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all. If the Company does not raise the necessary amounts of money, it may have to curtail its operations until such time as it is able to raise the required funding.\nDue to the Companys recurring losses from operations and future liquidity needs, there is substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nIn response to the global outbreak of COVID-19 and the World Health Organizations classification of the outbreak as a pandemic, the Company continues to take the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of its employees and to minimize interruptions to its operations. Management follows the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC) guidance and the recommendations and restrictions provided by state and local authorities. The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report. As such, it is uncertain as to the full impact the pandemic will have on the Companys future financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Management is actively monitoring the risks to public health and the impact of overall global business activity on the Companys financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce.\n3.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nCash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist principally of unrestricted cash on deposit and short-term money market funds. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity when purchased of less than three months as cash and cash equivalents.\nU.S. Treasury Bills - U.S. Treasury Bills (T-bills) are highly liquid short-term investments with maturity dates of greater than 3 months, but less than one year. These investments are recorded at fair value.\nSupplies used for R&D and manufacturing - Supplies are consumable items kept on hand to support the Companys R&D and manufacturing operations. Supplies are recorded at cost and are charged to expense as they are used in operations.\nProperty and Equipment - Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of five to seven years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the lease. Repairs and maintenance which do not extend the life of the asset are expensed when incurred. Property and equipment are reviewed on a quarterly basis to determine if any of the assets are impaired.\nPatents - Patent expenditures are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the expected useful life or the legal life of the patent (17 years). In the event changes in technology or other circumstances impair the value or life of the patent, appropriate adjustment to the asset value and period of amortization is made. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset, and from disposition, are less than the carrying value of the asset. The amount of the impairment loss would be the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset and its carrying value.\nLeases - The Company accounts for contracts that convey the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment over a period of time in exchange for consideration, as leases upon inception. The Company leases certain real estate, machinery, laboratory equipment and office equipment over varying periods. Many of these leases include an option to either renew or terminate the lease. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, these options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. The incremental borrowing rate utilized to calculate the lease liabilities is based on the information available at the commencement date, as most of the leases do not provide an implicit borrowing rate. Short-term leases, defined as leases with initial terms of 12 months or less, are not reflected on the balance sheet. Lease expense for such short-term leases is not material.For purposes of calculating the finance and operating lease liabilities, lease and non-lease components are combined into a single element.\nDerivative Instruments - The Company has financing arrangements that consist of freestanding derivative instruments that contain embedded derivative features. The Company accounts for these arrangements in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. In accordance with ASC 815, derivative instruments and hybrid instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and are measured at fair value with gains or losses recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the derivative or hybrid instruments. The Company determines the fair value of derivative instruments and hybrid instruments based on available market data using appropriate valuation models considering all the rights and obligations of each instrument. The derivative liabilities are re-measured at fair value at the end of each interim period.\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity effective October 1, 2021. The amendments in this ASU simplify and clarify the guidance in Subtopic 815-40. There was no financial impact upon adoption.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuers Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options. This standard was issued to clarify and reduce diversity in an issuers accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (for example, warrants) that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. ASU 2021-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, however, as permitted, the Company has elected to prospectively adopt the standard effective as of October 1, 2021.\nStock-Based Compensation - Compensation cost for all stock-based awards is measured at fair value as of the grant date in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. The fair value of stock options is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires various judgmental assumptions including volatility and expected option life. The stock-based compensation cost is recognized using the straight-line allocation method as expense over the requisite service or vesting period.\nThe Company has Incentive Stock Option Plans, Non-Qualified Stock Option Plans, Stock Compensation Plans, Stock Bonus Plans and an Incentive Stock Bonus Plan. These Plans are collectively referred to as the \"Plans\". All Plans have been approved by the Companys stockholders.\nThe Companys stock options are not transferable, and the actual value of the stock options that an employee may realize, if any, will depend on the excess of the market price on the date of exercise over the exercise price. For options issued with service conditions only, the assumption for stock price volatility is based on the variance of daily closing prices of the Companys stock. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on the U.S. Treasury rate at the date of grant with the term equal to the expected life of the option. Forfeitures are accounted for when they occur. The expected term of options represents the period that options granted are expected to be outstanding and has been determined based on an analysis of historical exercise behavior. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense for new awards may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.\nRestricted stock granted under the Incentive Stock Bonus Plan and options granted under the 2021 and 2020 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plans are subject to service, performance and market conditions and meet the classification of equity awards. These awards were measured at fair value on the grant dates using a Monte Carlo simulation for issuances where the attainment of performance criteria is uncertain. The total compensation cost will be expensed over the estimated requisite service period.\nResearch and Development Costs - Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Management accrues Clinical Research Organization (CRO) expenses and clinical trial study expenses based on services performed and relies on the CROs to provide estimates of those costs applicable to the completion stage of a study. Estimated accrued CRO costs are subject to revisions as such studies progress to completion. The Company records revisions to estimated expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\nNet Loss Per Common Share - The Company calculates net loss per common share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share (ASC 260). Basic and diluted net loss per common share was determined by dividing net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Companys potentially dilutive shares, which include outstanding common stock options, unvested restricted stock and common stock warrants, have not been included in the computation of diluted net loss per share for all periods as the result would be anti-dilutive.\nConcentration of Credit Risk - Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with high quality financial institutions. At times, these accounts may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such bank accounts. The Company believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents. All non-interest bearing cash balances were fully insured up to $250,000 at September 30, 2022.\nIncome Taxes - The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and tax loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be recognized. A full valuation allowance was recorded against the deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company adopted ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, effective October 1, 2021. The new standard includes several provisions that simplify accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and increasing consistency and clarity for the users of financial statements. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 had no impact on the Companys financial statements.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IR Act) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax.\nUse of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, obsolescence of supplies used for R&D and manufacturing, accruals, stock options, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance, and the valuation of derivative liabilities. Actual results could differ from estimates, although management does not believe such differences would materially affect the financial statements in any given year. However, regarding the valuation of derivative liabilities determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model, significant fluctuations may materially affect the financial statements in a given year. Additionally, in calculating the right of use assets and lease liabilities, estimates and assumptions were used to determine the incremental borrowing rates and the expected lease terms. The Company considers the estimates used in valuing the derivative liabilities and the lease assets and liabilities to be significant.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company has considered all recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe the adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial statements.\n4.\nWARRANTS AND NON-EMPLOYEE OPTIONS\nThe following warrants and non-employee options are outstanding at September 30, 2022:\nWarrant/Options\nIssue Date\nShares Issuable\nupon Exercise\nof Warrants/ Options\nExercise Price\nExpiration Date\nSeries N\n8/18/2008\n85,339\n$ 3.00\n8/18/2024\nSeries UU\n6/11/2018\n93,603\n$ 2.80\n6/30/2024\nSeries X\n1/13/2016\n120,000\n$ 9.25\n7/13/2024\nSeries Y\n2/15/2016\n26,000\n$ 12.00\n8/15/2024\nSeries MM\n6/22/2017\n333,432\n$ 1.86\n6/22/2024\nSeries NN\n7/24/2017\n200,087\n$ 2.52\n7/24/2024\nSeries RR\n10/30/2017\n251,761\n$ 1.65\n10/30/2022\nSeries SS\n12/19/2017\n200,000\n$ 2.09\n12/18/2022\nSeries TT\n2/5/2018\n$ 2.24\n2/5/2023\nConsultant Options\n7/28/2017 - 11/18/2020\n15,000\n$ 2.18 - $11.61\n11/17/2022 - 7/27/2027\nThe following warrants and non-employee options are outstanding at September 30, 2021:\nWarrant/Options\nIssue Date\nShares Issuable\nupon Exercise\nof Warrants/ Options\nExercise Price\nExpiration Date\nSeries N\n8/18/2008\n85,339\n$ 3.00\n8/18/2022\nSeries UU\n6/11/2018\n93,603\n$ 2.80\n6/30/2022\nSeries X\n1/13/2016\n120,000\n$ 9.25\n7/13/2022\nSeries Y\n2/15/2016\n26,000\n$ 12.00\n8/15/2022\nSeries Z\n5/23/2016\n184,800\n$ 13.75\n11/23/2021\nSeries CC\n12/8/2016\n15,845\n$ 5.00\n12/8/2021\nSeries HH\n2/23/2017\n$ 3.13\n2/16/2022\nSeries AA\n8/26/2016\n100,000\n$ 13.75\n2/22/2022\nSeries MM\n6/22/2017\n333,432\n$ 1.86\n6/22/2022\nSeries NN\n7/24/2017\n210,087\n$ 2.52\n7/24/2022\nSeries RR\n10/30/2017\n251,761\n$ 1.65\n10/30/2022\nSeries SS\n12/19/2017\n200,000\n$ 2.09\n12/18/2022\nSeries TT\n2/5/2018\n$ 2.24\n2/5/2023\nConsultant Options\n7/28/2017 - 11/18/2020\n15,000\n$ 2.18 - $11.61\n11/17/2022 - 7/27/2027\nA.\nWarrant Liabilities\nWarrant liabilities outstanding at September 30 are as follows:\nSeries Z warrants\n$ -\n$ 64,787\nSeries AA warrants\n-\n276,035\nSeries CC warrants\n-\n94,961\nSeries HH warrants\n-\n1,597\nTotal warrant liabilities\n$ -\n$ 437,380\nThe gains/(losses) on the warrant liabilities for the years ended September 30 are as follows:\nSeries W warrants\n$ -\n$ 73,570\nSeries Z warrants\n64,787\n252,115\nSeries ZZ warrants\n-\n(98,692 )\nSeries AA warrants\n276,035\n(318,823 )\nSeries BB warrants\n-\n65,173\nSeries CC warrants\n24,372\n(668,605 )\nSeries HH warrants\n1,597\nNet loss on warrant liabilities\n$ 366,791\n$ (694,858 )\nThe Company reviews all outstanding warrants in accordance with the requirements of ASC 815. This topic provides that an entity should use a two-step approach to evaluate whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to its own stock, including evaluating the instruments contingent exercise and settlement provisions. The warrant agreements provide for adjustments to the exercise price for certain dilutive events. Under the provisions of ASC 815, the warrants are not considered indexed to the Companys stock because future equity offerings or sales of the Companys stock are not an input to the fair value of a fixed-for-fixed option on equity shares, and equity classification is therefore precluded.\nIn accordance with ASC 815, derivative liabilities must be measured at fair value upon issuance and re-valued at the end of each reporting period through expiration. Any change in fair value between the respective reporting periods is recognized as a gain or loss in the statement of operations.\nChanges in Warrant Liabilities\nIn February 2022, 100,000 Series AA warrants with an exercise price of $13.75 and 200 Series HH warrants with an exercise price of $3.13, expired.\nIn December 2021, 640 Series CC warrants, with an exercise price of $5.00, expired.\nIn November 2021, 184,800 Series Z warrants, with an exercise price of $13.75, expired.\nOn August 22, 2021, 16,000 Series BB warrants, with an exercise price of $13.75, expired.\nOn October 28, 2020, 688,930 Series W warrants, with an exercise price of $16.75, expired.\nExercise of Warrant Liabilities\nThe following warrants recorded as liabilities were exercised during the year ended September 30, 2022:\nWarrants\nWarrants Exercised\nExercise Price\nProceeds\nSeries CC\n15,205\n$ 5.00\n$ 76,025\nThe following warrants recorded as liabilities were exercised during the year ended September 30, 2021:\nWarrants\nWarrants Exercised\nExercise Price\nProceeds\nSeries Z\n79,200\n$ 13.75\n$ 1,089,000\nSeries ZZ\n20,000\n$ 13.75\n275,000\nSeries AA\n100,000\n$ 13.75\n1,375,000\nSeries CC\n132,798\n$ 5.00\n663,990\n331,998\n$ 3,402,990\nB.\nEquity Warrants\nChanges in Equity Warrants\nOn June 13, 2022, the expiration dates of the Series N, Series X, Series Y, Series UU, Series MM and Series NN warrants were extended two years. The incremental costs of the Series N, Series X and Series Y warrant extensions were recorded as a deemed dividend and totaled approximately $294,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The Series N and Series X warrants are held by the de Clara Trust. The incremental cost of the Series MM, Series NN and Series UU warrant extensions of approximately $635,000 was recorded as a deemed dividend because there were no longer any notes payable associated with these warrants at the time of modification. The Series UU warrants and a portion of the Series MM and Series NN warrants are held by Geert Kersten, Patricia Prichep (current officers of the Company) and the de Clara Trust.\nOn June 28, 2021, the expiration dates of the Series N, Series X, Series Y and Series UU warrants were extended one year. On December 7, 2020, the expiration dates of the Series N, Series X, Series Y and Series UU warrants were extended six months. The incremental costs of the warrant extensions were recorded consistent with the accounting for the initial warrant issuances. The incremental costs of the Series N and Series X warrant extensions were recorded as a deemed dividend and totaled approximately $351,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021, respectively. The Series N and Series X warrants are held by the de Clara Trust. The incremental cost of the Series Y warrant extension was recorded as additional paid in capital and totaled approximately $103,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021. The incremental cost of the Series UU warrant extension was recorded as interest expense because these warrants were initially issued as an inducement to convert notes payable into common stock and totaled approximately $24,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021. The Series UU warrants are held by Geert Kersten, Patricia Prichep and the de Clara Trust.\nExercise of Equity Warrants\nThe following equity warrants were exercised during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nWarrants\nWarrants Exercised\nExercise Price\nProceeds\nSeries NN\n10,000\n$ 2.52\n$ 25,200\nThe following equity warrants were exercised during the year ended September 30, 2021.\nWarrants\nWarrants Exercised\nExercise Price\nProceeds\nSeries MM\n464,201\n$ 1.86\n$ 863,414\nSeries NN\n138,755\n$ 2.52\n349,663\nSeries RR\n165,888\n$ 1.65\n273,715\nSeries SS\n126,064\n$ 2.09\n263,474\nSeries TT\n370,964\n$ 2.24\n830,959\n1,265,872\n$ 2,581,225\nC.\nOptions and Shares Issued to Consultants\nThe Company typically enters into consulting arrangements in exchange for common stock or stock options. During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company issued 156,547 and 75,885 shares, respectively, of common stock to consultants, all of which were restricted shares. Under these arrangements, during the periods presented, the common stock was issued with stock prices ranging from $2.86 to $24.95 per share. The weighted average grant price was $4.59 and $15.46, respectively, for stock issued during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded total expense of approximately $762,000 and $1,227,000, respectively, relating to these consulting agreements. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, unamortized balances of $295,000 and $364,000, respectively, are included in prepaid expenses as the contracts are ongoing and will be recognized in future periods as incurred.\nNo options were issued to consultants during the year ended September 30, 2022. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company issued 5,000 options to a consultant to purchase common stock with an exercise price of $11.61 and an expiration of November 17, 2022. As of September 30, 2022, 15,000 options issued to consultants as payment for services remained outstanding, all of which were issued from the Non-Qualified Stock Option plan and are fully vested.\n5.\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following at September 30:\nResearch equipment\n$ 4,095,022\n$ 4,211,124\nFurniture and equipment\n99,296\n99,768\nLeasehold improvements\n13,544,394\n13,465,123\n17,738,712\n17,776,015\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization\n(5,849,683 )\n(4,112,453 )\nNet property and equipment\n$ 11,889,029\n$ 13,663,562\nDepreciation expense for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 totaled approximately $1,977,000 and $447,000 respectively.\n6.\nPATENTS\nPatents consist of the following at September 30:\nPatents\n$ 893,833\n$ 910,523\nAccumulated amortization\n(681,632 )\n(634,657 )\nPatents, net\n$ 212,201\n$ 275,866\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, there was no impairment of patent costs. Amortization expense for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 totaled approximately $49,000 and $52,000, respectively. The total estimated future amortization is as follows:\nYears ending September 30,\n$ 38,000\n30,000\n28,000\n24,000\n21,000\nThereafter\n71,000\n$ 212,000\n7.\nINCOME TAXES\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $52.9 million and $44.1 million, respectively. Due to uncertainties surrounding the Companys ability to generate future taxable income to realize these assets, a full valuation allowance has been established to offset the net deferred tax assets. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considered whether it was more likely than not that some, or all, of the deferred tax asset will be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. Management has considered the history of the Companys operating losses and believes that the realization of the benefit of the deferred tax assets cannot be reasonably assured.\nPursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, or IRC, annual use of the Companys net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards may be limited in the event a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% occurs within a three-year period. Such ownership change could result in annual limitations on the utilization of tax attributes, including NOL carryforwards and tax credits. The Company performed an analysis to determine if any additional ownership changes occurred during the year ended September 30, 2022 and no such shifts were identified. If changes in ownership occur after year end, NOL and tax credit carryforwards could be eliminated or restricted. If eliminated, the related asset would be removed from the deferred tax asset schedule with a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance.\nThe Company had federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $100.2 million and $77.1 million at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Approximately $19.2 million of the NOL carryforwards begin to expire during the year ended September 30, 2023 and become fully expired by 2038 and approximately $81.0 million of NOL carryforwards, which were generated subsequent to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, have an indefinite life. In addition, the Company has a general business credit as a result of the credit for increasing research activities (R&D credit) of approximately $1.2 million at September 30, 2022 and 2021. The R&D credit expires during the fiscal year ending September 30, 2029.\nSignificant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 are listed below:\nNOL carryforwards\n$ 25,346,000\n$ 19,789,000\nCapitalized R&D\n15,042,000\n15,040,000\nStock-based compensation\n10,442,000\n7,785,000\nLease liabilities\n3,872,000\n4,101,000\nR&D credit\n1,221,000\n1,221,000\nVacation and other\n307,000\n126,000\nTotal deferred tax assets\n56,230,000\n48,062,000\nRight of use assets\n(3,244,000 )\n(3,786,000 )\nFixed assets and intangibles\n(44,000 )\n(172,000 )\nTotal deferred tax liability\n(3,288,000 )\n(3,958,000 )\nNet deferred tax asset\n52,942,000\n44,104,000\nValuation allowance\n(52,942,000 )\n(44,104,000 )\nEnding balance\n$ -\n$ -\nThe Company has no federal or state current or deferred tax expense or benefit. The Companys effective tax rate differs from the applicable federal statutory tax rate. The reconciliation of these rates is as follows for the years ended September 30:\nFederal rate\n21.00 %\n21.00 %\nState tax rate change\n(1.67 )\n(1.37 )\nState tax rate, net of federal benefit\n4.34\n4.72\nOther adjustments\n(0.28 )\n(0.79 )\nPermanent differences\n0.21\n0.23\nChange in valuation allowance\n(23.61 )\n(23.79 )\nEffective tax rate\n0.00 %\n0.00 %\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which requires financial statement benefits to be recognized for positions taken for tax return purposes when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained. The Company has elected to reflect any tax penalties or interest resulting from tax assessments on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. The Company has generated federal net operating losses during the tax years ended September 30, 1999 through 2022. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal and state income tax examinations by tax authorities for years September 30, 2018 and prior.\n8.\nSTOCK COMPENSATION\nThe Company recognized the following expenses for options issued or vested and restricted stock awarded during the year:\nYear Ended September 30,\nEmployees\n$ 11,389,932\n$ 13,685,046\nNon-employees\n$ 762,261\n$ 1,226,690\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 the fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions.\nExpected stock price volatility\n96.37 - 99.26%\n90.42 - 97.22%\nRisk-free interest rate\n1.50 - 3.43%\n0.85 - 1.65%\nExpected life of options\n9.67 - 9.69 years\n9.68 - 9.69 years\nExpected dividend yield\n-\n-\nNon-Qualified Stock Option Plans -\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company adopted the 2022 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, which provides for the issuance of up to 2,000,000 options to purchase shares of common stock. On November 19, 2021, the Company granted 250,000 performance-based stock options from the 2020 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan to officers. Each option entitles the holder to purchase one share of the Companys common stock at a price of $10.48 per share, the fair value on the date of issuance. The stock options will vest 100% upon approval of the first marketing application for any pharmaceutical based upon the Companys Multikine technology in any of the USA, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, or Australia. None of the options will be exercisable before November 19, 2022. All options which have not vested as of November 18, 2031 will be canceled. On the grant date, the options were valued using a Monte Carlo Simulation. A Monte Carlo Simulation is a statistical technique that is used to model probabilistic systems and establish the probabilities for a variety of outcomes. However, because attainment of the performance condition cannot be considered probable, no compensation cost is recognized relating to these options as of September 30, 2022. Management will reassess the probability of achieving the performance condition at each reporting date.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company adopted the 2021 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, which provides for the issuance of up to 1,800,000 options to purchase shares of common stock. On May 14, 2021, the Company granted 1,800,000 performance-based stock options from the 2021 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan and 72,000 performance-based stock options from the 2020 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan to officers and directors. Each option entitles the holder to purchase one share of the Company's common stock at a price of $20.61 per share, the fair value on the date of issuance. The stock options will vest 100% upon the achievement of the following performance goals: (a) the filing of the first marketing application for any pharmaceutical based upon the Company's Multikine technology in the US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, or Australia or (b) the closing price of the Company's common stock exceeds $42.00. The options first became exercisable on May 13, 2022. All options which have not vested as of May 13, 2031, will be canceled and will no longer be exercisable. The options were recorded in permanent equity in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. On the grant date, the options were valued using a Monte Carlo Simulation approach. That valuation resulted in a per share fair value of $0.34 and an aggregate value of approximately $636,000 on the grant date. The aggregate value will be expensed over the requisite service period of the options, which was determined to be 1.3 years. This resulted in compensation expense of approximately $189,000 during the year ended September 30, 2021. The remaining $447,000 was expensed during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nAt September 30, 2022, the Company has collectively authorized the issuance of 13,787,200 options to purchase shares of common stock under its Non-Qualified Stock Option Plans. Options typically vest over a three-year period and expire no later than ten years after the grant date. Terms of the options were determined by the Companys Compensation Committee, which administers the plans. The Companys employees, directors, officers, and consultants or advisors are eligible to be granted options under the Non-Qualified Stock Option Plans.\nIncentive Stock Option Plans - At September 30, 2022, the Company had collectively authorized the issuance of 138,400 options to purchase shares of common stock under its Incentive Stock Option Plans. Options typically vest over a three-year period and expire no later than ten years after the grant date. Terms of the options were determined by the Companys Compensation Committee which administers the plans. Only the Companys employees are eligible to be granted options under the Incentive Stock Option Plans.\nActivity in the Companys Non-Qualified and Incentive Stock Option Plans for the two years ended September 30, 2022 is summarized as follows:\nNon-Qualified and Incentive Stock Option Plans\nOutstanding\nExercisable\nNumber of Shares\nWeighted Average Exercise Price\nWeighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (Years)\nAggregate Intrinsic Value\nNumber of Shares\nWeighted Average Exercise Price\nWeighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (Years)\nAggregate Intrinsic Value\nOutstanding at September 30, 2020\n8,653,703\n$ 7.01\n8.39\n$ 56,193,415\n3,297,229\n$ 5.85\n7.48\n$ 29,090,662\nVested\n2,401,961\n$ 6.26\nGranted (a)\n2,605,000\n$ 20.58\nExercised\n(149,788 )\n$ 4.98\n(149,788 )\n$ 4.98\nForfeited\n(49,832 )\n$ 9.56\nExpired\n(9,374 )\n$ 172.73\n(9,374 )\n$ 172.73\nOutstanding at September 30, 2021\n11,049,709\n$ 10.08\n7.93\n$ 54,843,283\n5,540,028\n$ 5.77\n6.96\n$ 43,589,598\nVested\n1,547,703\n$ 8.60\nGranted\n2,040,750\n$ 4.24\nExercised\n(6,500 )\n$ 4.59\n(6,500 )\n$ 4.59\nForfeited\n(106,331 )\n$ 11.53\nExpired\n13,614 )\n$ 97.50\n(13,614 )\n$ 97.50\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022\n12,964,014\n$ 9.06\n7.35\n$ 1,866,240\n7,067,617\n$ 6.21\n6.21\n$ 1,866,105\n(a)\nIncludes 1,872,000 performance based options issued to officers and directors, 728,000 options issued to employees and 5,000 options issued to consultants.\nA summary of the status of the Companys non-vested options for the two years ended September 30, 2022 is presented below:\nNumber of\nOptions\nWeighted Average Grant Date Fair Value\nUnvested at September 30, 2020\n5,356,474\n$ 4.76\nVested\n(2,401,961 )\nGranted\n2,605,000\nForfeited\n(49,832 )\nUnvested at September 30, 2021\n5,509,681\n$ 5.17\nVested\n(1,547,703 )\nGranted\n2,040,750\nForfeited\n(106,331 )\nUnvested at September 30, 2022\n5,896,397\n$ 3.63\nIncentive Stock Bonus Plan - On September 30, 2022, 614,500 of the shares granted under the 2014 Incentive Stock Bonus Plan remain outstanding, of which 463,250 shares are fully vested. The shares are being earned upon the achievement of certain milestones leading to the commercialization of the Companys Multikine technology, or specified increases in the market price of the Companys stock. The fair value of the shares on the grant date was calculated using the market value on the grant date for issuances where the attainment of performance criteria is likely and using a Monte Carlo Simulation for issuances where the attainment of performance criteria is uncertain. The grant date fair value of shares issued that remain outstanding as of September 30, 2022 was approximately $8.6 million. The total value of the shares, if earned, is being expensed over the requisite service periods for each milestone, provided the requisite service periods are rendered, regardless of whether the market conditions are met. No compensation cost is recognized for awards where the requisite service period is not rendered. During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded expense relating to the issuance of restricted stock pursuant to the plan of approximately $45,000 and $0.3 million. As of September 30, 2022, all compensation expense related to the 2014 Incentive Stock Bonus Plan has been fully recognized.\nA summary of the status of the Companys restricted common stock issued from the Incentive Stock Bonus Plan for the two years ended September 30, 2022 is presented below:\nNumber of\nShares\nWeighted Average Grant Date Fair Value\nUnvested at September 30, 2020\n304,500\n$ 13.75\nForfeited\n(2,000 )\nVested\n(151,250 )\nUnvested at September 30, 2021\n151,250\n$ 13.75\nForfeited\n-\nVested\n-\nUnvested at September 30, 2022\n151,250\n$ 13.75\nStock Bonus Plans - As of September 30, 2022, the Company authorized to issue up to 783,760 shares of common stock under its Stock Bonus Plans and has issued a total of 415,968 shares of common stock from the Stock Bonus Plans. All employees, directors, officers, consultants, and advisors are eligible to be granted shares.\nStock Compensation Plans - On September 30, 2022, 634,000 shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to the Companys Stock Compensation Plans, of which 153,195 shares were issued and outstanding. No shares were issued from the Stock Compensation Plans to consultants for payment of services during the years ended September 30, 2022, and 2021.\n9.\nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN\nThe Company maintains a defined contribution retirement plan, qualifying under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and covering substantially all Company employees. Each participants contribution is matched by the Company with shares of common stock that have a value equal to 100% of the participants contribution, not to exceed the lesser of $10,000 or 6% of the participants total compensation. The Companys contribution of common stock is valued each quarter based upon the closing bid price of the Companys common stock. During the year ended September 30, 2022, 52,882 shares were issued to the Companys 401(k) plan with a cost of approximately $223,000. During the year ended September 30, 2021, 17,990 shares were issued to the Companys 401(k) plan with a cost of approximately $201,000.\n10.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nClinical Research Agreements\nIn April 2013, the Company entered into a co-development and revenue sharing agreement with Ergomed. Under the agreement, Ergomed will contribute up to $10 million towards the Companys Phase III clinical study in the form of offering discounted clinical services in exchange for a single digit percentage of milestone and royalty payments, up to a specific maximum amount. In October 2015, the Company entered into a second co-development and revenue sharing agreement with Ergomed for an additional $2 million, for a total of $12 million. The Company accounted for the co-development and revenue sharing agreement in accordance with ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements. The Company determined the payments to Ergomed are within the scope of ASC 730, Research and Development. Therefore, the Company records the discount on the clinical services as a credit to research and development expense on its Statements of Operations. Since the Company entered into the co-development and revenue sharing agreement with Ergomed, it has incurred research and development expenses of approximately $35.5 million related to Ergomeds services. This amount is net of Ergomeds discount of approximately $11.8 million. During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded approximately $0.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively, as research and development expense related to Ergomeds services. These amounts were net of Ergomeds discount of approximately $0.1 million and $0.6 million during both the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nLease Agreements\nThe Company leases a manufacturing facility near Baltimore, Maryland (the San Tomas lease). The building was remodeled in accordance with the Companys specifications so that it can be used by the Company to manufacture Multikine for the Companys Phase 3 clinical trial and sales of the drug if approved by the FDA. The lease is for a term of twenty years and requires annual base rent to escalate each year at 3%. The Company is required to pay all real estate and personal property taxes, insurance premiums, maintenance expenses, repair costs and utilities. The lease allows the Company, at its election, to extend the lease for two ten-year periods or to purchase the building at the end of the 20-year lease, which expires in October 2028. The renewal options are not included in the calculation of the right of use asset and lease liability because exercise of those options is not reasonably certain.\nUpon adoption of ASC 842 on October 1, 2019, the Company recorded a finance lease right of use asset of approximately $16.5 million and a finance lease liability of approximately $13.5 million. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the net book value of the finance lease right of use asset is approximately $10.9 million and $12.7 million and the balance of the finance lease liability is approximately $13.3 million and $13.8 million, of which approximately $1.6 million and $0.6 million is current. These amounts include the San Tomas lease as well as several other smaller finance leases for office equipment. During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the finance right of use assets are being depreciated using a straight-line method over the underlying lease terms and totaled approximately $1.8 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Total cash paid related to finance leases during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $0 and $2.5 million, respectively, of which approximately $1.2 million was for interest in both years. The weighted average discount rate of the Companys finance leases is 8.45% and the weighted average time to maturity is 6.08 years.\nIn August 2020, the Company entered into an amendment to the San Tomas lease agreement under which the landlord agreed to allow the Company to substantially upgrade the manufacturing facility in preparation for the potential commercial production of Multikine. The upgrades were completed and the improvements were placed in service in October 2021. The total cost of the upgrades was $11.1 million. The landlord agreed to finance the final $2.4 million of the costs incurred which will be repaid through increased lease payments over the remaining lease term starting on March 1, 2021. The repayment includes a base rent which escalates at 3% each year plus interest that accrues at 13.75% per year. The Company remeasured the lease liability to account for the modified payments using an 8.45% incremental borrowing rate (IBR). The rate was determined using a synthetic credit rating analysis prepared by an outside valuation specialist. Additionally, this financing is considered to be a lease incentive from the landlord and has been included in the calculation of the lease liability as it is realized. The entire $2.4 million was received from the landlord as of September 30, 2022. The leasehold improvements are recorded in property and equipment and are being amortized over the remaining lease term.\nDuring June 2021, the Company determined that it used an incorrect discount rate to calculate the opening ROU asset and lease liability balances upon adoption of ASC 842. Management engaged an outside valuation specialist to perform a synthetic credit rating analysis which resulted in a revised rate to be used upon adoption of ASC 842 of 10.19% compared to the previously used rate of 8.80%. This change resulted in an immaterial difference to the September 30, 2020 financial statements, and was corrected in the quarterly period ended June 30, 2021 as an out of period adjustment.\nThe Company was required to deposit the equivalent of one year of base rent in accordance with the original lease. Under the landlords $2.4 million financing arrangement, the Company was required to deposit an additional $0.2 million in March 2021. Because the Company met the minimum cash balance required by the lease, the full amount of the deposit was returned to the Company in January 2022. If the Companys cash balance falls below the required balance, the Company will be required to re-deposit these funds with the landlord. The approximate $1.9 million deposit is included in non-current assets as of September 30, 2021.\nApproximate future minimum lease payments under finance leases as of September 30, 2022 are as follows:\nYear ending September 30,\n$ 2,576,000\n2,655,000\n2,741,000\n2,832,000\n2,923,000\nThereafter\n3,267,000\nTotal future minimum lease obligations\n16,994,000\nLess imputed interest on finance lease obligations\n(3,712,000 )\nNet present value of finance lease obligations\n$ 13,282,000\nThe Company leases two facilities under operating leases. The lease for the Companys office headquarters will expire on November 30, 2025. The lease for its research and development laboratory was renewed in September 2021 for an additional ten years and will expire on February 29, 2032. The renewal was considered a modification for accounting purposes and the right of use asset and liability were remeasured as of the date of the renewal. This resulted in an increase of approximately $1.1 million to the operating lease right of use asset and liability. The operating leases include escalating rental payments. The Company is recognizing the related rent expense on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases.\nUpon adoption of ASC 842 on October 1, 2019, the Company recorded an operating lease right of use asset and an operating lease liability of approximately $1.0 million. As of September 30, 2022, the net book value of the operating lease right of use asset is approximately $1.9 million and the balance of the operating lease liability is approximately $2.0 million, of which approximately $0.2 million is current. As of September 30, 2021, the net book value of the operating lease right of use asset is approximately $2.1 million and the balance of the operating lease liability is approximately $2.1 million, of which approximately $0.1 million is current. During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred lease expense under operating leases of approximately $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Total cash paid related to operating leases during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $0.3 million for each year. The weighted average discount rate of the Companys operating leases is 9.09% and the weighted average time to maturity is 8.83 years.\nAs of September 30, 2022, future minimum lease payments under operating leases are as follows:\nYear ending September 30,\n$ 348,000\n357,000\n366,000\n287,000\n277,000\nThereafter\n1,325,000\nTotal future minimum lease obligations\n2,960,000\nLess imputed interest on operating lease obligation\n(939,000 )\nNet present value of operating lease obligation\n$ 2,021,000\nVendor Obligations\nThe Company has contingent obligations with vendors for work that will be completed in relation to the Phase 3 clinical trial. The timing of these obligations cannot be determined at this time. The Company estimates it will incur additional expenses of approximately $0.6 million for the remainder of the Phase 3 clinical trial and the filing of the clinical study report with the FDA. This estimate is based only on the information currently available from the Clinical Research Organizations responsible for managing the Phase 3 clinical trial and does not include other related costs.\n11.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, no restricted shares of the Companys common stock were purchased by related parties. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the de Clara Trust, of which the Companys CEO, Geert Kersten, is a trustee and beneficiary, and two directors purchased a total of 27,500 restricted shares of the Companys common stock at an aggregate fair market value of approximately $220,000. The shares are subject to the conditions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933.\nOn June 13, 2022, the expiration dates of the Series N, Series X, Series Y, Series UU, Series MM and Series NN warrants were extended two years (Note 4). The incremental costs of the Series N, Series X and Series Y warrant extensions were recorded as a deemed dividend and totaled approximately $294,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The Series N and Series X warrants are held by the de Clara Trust. The incremental cost of the Series MM, Series NN and Series UU warrant extensions of approximately $635,000 was recorded as a deemed dividend because there are no longer any notes payable associated with these warrants at the time of modification. The Series UU warrants and a portion of the Series MM and Series NN warrants are held by Geert Kersten, Patricia Prichep (current officers of the Company) and the de Clara Trust.\nIn June 2021, the expiration dates of the Series N, Series X, and Series UU warrants were extended one year. In December 2020, the expiration dates of the Series N, Series X, Series UU warrants were extended six months. The incremental costs of the warrant extensions were recorded consistent with the accounting for the initial warrant issuances. The incremental costs of the Series N and Series X warrant extensions were recorded as a deemed dividend and totaled approximately $351,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021. The Series N and Series X warrants are held by the de Clara Trust. The incremental cost of the Series UU warrant extension was recorded as interest expense and totaled approximately $24,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021. The Series UU warrants are held by certain officers of the Company and were originally issued with convertible debt.\n12.\nSTOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nExercise of Warrants\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company received proceeds of approximately $0.1 million and $6.0 million, respectively, from the exercise of warrants, as detailed in Note 4. Upon exercise, 25,205 and 1,597,870 shares of common stock were issued during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nSales of Securities\nThere were no sales of securities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nIn June 2021, the Company sold 1,400,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $22.62 per share and received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $29.4 million. At that time, the underwriters fully exercised their option to purchase up to 210,000 additional shares of common stock to cover over-allotments, resulting in additional net proceeds to the Company of approximately $4.4 million.\nIn December 2020, the Company sold 1,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $14.65 per share and received aggregate proceeds of approximately $13.6 million.\nOther Equity Transactions\nThe Company entered into Securities Purchase Agreements (SPA) with Ergomed plc, one of the Companys Clinical Research Organizations responsible for managing the Companys Phase 3 clinical trial, to facilitate payment of amounts due Ergomed. Under the Agreements, the Company issued Ergomed shares of common stock and the net proceeds from the sales of those shares reduces outstanding amounts due Ergomed. Upon issuance, the Company expenses the full value of the shares as Other non-operating gain/loss and subsequently offsets the expense as amounts are realized through the sale by Ergomed and reduces accounts payable to Ergomed.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, CEL-SCI did not issue Ergomed any shares of common stock. Additionally, no shares were sold during the year ended September 30, 2022. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the company recorded Other Non-operating gains of approximately $1.7 million upon the resale of shares from the SPA. All outstanding shares have been resold as of September 30, 2022 and the Company has approximately $22,000 in amounts remaining in prepaid to Ergomed.\n13.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nIn accordance with the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, the Company determines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company generally applies the income approach to determine fair value. This method uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount. The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations with respect to the future amounts.\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\no\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\no\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and amounts derived from valuation models where all significant inputs other than quoted prices are observable for the asset or liability.\no\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect managements assumptions\nFor disclosure purposes, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety in the fair value hierarchy level based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the overall fair value measurement. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.\nThe Company purchased short-term T-bills during the year ended September 30, 2021 that are classified as trading securities. Quoted market prices were applied to determine the fair value of short-term investments, therefore they were categorized as Level 1 on the fair value hierarchy. The T-bills were recorded at fair market value, which includes an unrealized gain of approximately $6,000. The T-bills matured in December 2021 and yielded a weighted average interest rate of 0.10%. The Company is not holding any T-bills as of September 30, 2022.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, all of the Companys derivative liabilities are classified as Level 3.\nThe following sets forth the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances related to fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), as of September 30:\nBeginning balance\n$ 437,380\n$ 3,765,613\nIssuances\n-\n-\nExercises\n(70,589 )\n(4,023,091 )\nN Net realized and unrealized derivative loss\n(366,791 )\n694,858\nEnding balance\n$ -\n$ 437,380\nThe fair values of the Companys derivative instruments disclosed above under Level 3 are primarily derived from valuation models where significant inputs such as historical price and volatility of the Companys stock were used. At September 30, 2022, the Company does not have any Level 3 derivative instruments. At September 30, 2021, the Companys Level 3 derivative instruments have a weighted average fair value of $1.45 per share and a weighted average exercise price of $13.28 per share. Fair values were determined using a weighted average risk free interest rate of 0.05% and volatility of 109%. The instruments have a weighted average time to maturity of 0.3 years.\n14.\nNET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE\nBasic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Companys potentially dilutive shares, which include outstanding common stock options, common stock warrants and restricted stock are not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share if their effect would be anti-dilutive.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted per-share computations:\nYear ended September 30,\nLoss per share - basic\nNet loss available to common shareholders - basic\n$ (37,629,803 )\n$ (36,711,970 )\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic\n43,148,888\n40,662,137\nBasic loss per common share\n$ (0.87 )\n$ (0.90 )\nLoss per share - diluted\nNet loss available to common shareholders - basic\n$ (37,629,803 )\n$ (36,711,970 )\nUnrealized gain on derivatives (1)\n-\n(1,085,540 )\nNet loss available to common shareholders - diluted\n$ (37,629,803 )\n$ (37,797,510 )\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic\n43,148,888\n40,662,137\nIncremental shares underlying dilutive warrants (1)\n-\n32,111\nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted\n43,148,888\n40,694,248\nDiluted loss per common share\n$ (0.87 )\n$ (0.93 )\n(1) Includes Series Z, AA, CC and HH warrants for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nIn accordance with the contingently issuable shares guidance of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share, the calculation of diluted net loss per share excludes the following dilutive securities because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive as of September 30:\nOptions and Warrants\n14,274,836\n10,604,850\nUnvested Restricted Stock\n151,250\n151,250\nTotal\n14,426,086\n10,756,100\n15.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn October 28, 2022, the expiration date of the Series RR warrants were extended two years. The incremental cost of extending the Series RR warrants will be recorded as a deemed dividend, and totaled approximately $172,000. The Series RR warrants are held by Geert Kersten, Patricia Prichep (current officers of the Company) and the de Clara Trust.\nBetween October 1, 2022 and December 27, 2022 the company received approximately $0.5 million through the exercise of warrants to purchase shares of the Companys common stock.\nIn accordance with Section 13 or 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized on the 27 day of December 2022.\nCEL-SCI CORPORATION\nBy: /s/ Geert Kersten\nGeert Kersten, Chief Executive Officer\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of l934, this Report has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of the Registrant and in the capacities and on the dates indicated.\nSignature\nTitle\nDate\n/s/ Geert Kersten\nChief Executive, Principal Accounting,\nDecember 27, 2022\nGeert R.
