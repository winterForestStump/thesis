    "content": "Item 1. Business\nBackground\nGlobal WholeHealth Partners Corporation (the Company) was incorporated on March 7, 2013 in the State of Nevada. On May 9, 2019, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to effect a change of name to Global WholeHealth Partners Corporation and changed our ticker symbol to GWHP.\nOur Business\nThe Company develops and markets in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests. The Company has developed over 125 Diagnostic Tests with the criteria that they be low cost, OTC or self-administered, absolutely accurate, and provide immediate results. Company scientists participated in the development of the original Pregnancy test which was the first diagnostic to include these criteria and these criteria have been included in all Diagnostic tests developed by the Company since. Tests with these criteria have become to be known as Rapid Tests. The Company has 45 FDA approved tests for distribution in the US which include tests for Troponin, Colorectal, and Drug testing among others. The remainder tests carry an FDA Certificate of Exportability for distribution in foreign countries and include tests such as Ebola, ZIKA, Dengue Fever, Malaria, Influenza, Tuberculosis, Yellow Fever, Corona Viruses, and other epidemic and vector borne diseases.\nThe Company currently markets a range of IVD test kits for consumer use through over-the-counter (OTC or consumer), or consumer-use and point-of-care (POC or professional) for use by health care professionals, generally located at medical clinics, physician offices and hospitals, including those within penal systems throughout the US and abroad.\nAll of the products we sell are manufactured in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Approved Facility in the USA. An FDA Approved facility is a facility that meets Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) with the FDA.\nWe sell products internationally which are not FDA approved to sell in the US. These products include an FDA Certificate of Exportability and include tests such as Ebola, ZIKA, Dengue, Malaria, Influenza, Tuberculosis, Corona Viruses, and other vector borne diseases.\nCoVid-19 Activities\nFrom January of 2020 through January 2022, the Company was largely unsuccessful in its efforts to develop and sell COVID tests due to the commoditization of such tests and to the lack of recognition of the Company in the marketplace. The Company believes the opportunity here has diminished and is now focusing on its core business of manufacturing and distributing its vast product line of Diagnostic Tests.\nPlan of Operation\nThe Company is currently focusing its attention on marketing its core FDA OTC approved products which includes tests for pregnancy, ovulation, colorectal, drugs of abuse, glucose strips and glucose monitors through various platforms, including Walmart, Amazon, eBay and a recent contract with PrimeCare America for distribution in the Midwestern part of the country.\nIndustry\nThe IVD testing industry encompasses the following two primary categories: the OTC market and the POC. The concepts that distinguish POC technology-operation simple enough for non-laboratory users; little or no maintenance requirement; and rapid, reliable results-mean that it can be applied equally well in many non-clinical settings, such as the OTC market. As advances in medical technology increasingly make it possible to diagnose diseases and physiological conditions from ever-smaller amounts of body fluids, certain diseases and conditions that once required diagnosis by physicians and/or medical technicians inside hospital emergency rooms, exam rooms/bedside studies, or private clinics, can now also be done by inexpensive, easy-to-use diagnostic devices that consumers can use in the comfort and anonymity of their home. Today, the average pharmacy, whether a privately owned neighborhood store, or chain owned, has become an outlet for selling IVD test kits for in-home use.\nThe Company believes, according to publicly available sources, that the IVD industry is a multi-billion-dollar industry that is increasing each year. This assessment includes all laboratory hospital-based products, over-the-counter devices, and rapid tests performed at the point-of-care. The Company believes that the following factors can be attributed to the increase in overall need and use of IVD test kits: an aging baby-boomer population; increasing healthcare costs; the ever-growing number of uninsured and under-insured in the U.S. and abroad; and a general increase in consumer awareness, in part due to the wealth of information available on the Internet.\nCompetition\nDiagnostic products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, instrument warranty provisions, product performance, laboratory efficiency, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. We compete with several companies around the world who possess significantly greater technical and financial resources and professional and consumer reach and recognition, including Accon Labs, Johnson & Johnson, DB, Abbott, and Roche all of whom carry similar products.\nMarketing and Sales\nThe Company is focused on generating increased sales through online retail, large and small distributors and directly to doctors, hospitals, clinics and governments. The Company is taking steps and developing the materials needed to effect its marketing strategy.\nResearch and Development\nWe are continuing to look for needs in the world to create and work with our scientific team and science partners to make IVD tests for a variety of diseases as the need and opportunity arises.\nFacilities\nThe Company manufactures at two FDA approved labs located in San Diego and Escondido, California. All products are manufactured in the United States. The Corporate headquarters is located separately in the San Clemente, California business district. The two facilities have capacity to produce 250,000 units per day on a single shift. Further, additional facilities for lease are plentiful and can be equipped and setup quickly. We also provide third party manufacturing services.\nThe Company has sufficient warehouse facilities to accommodate our maximum production volumes and to keep sufficient inventory requirements (three months inventory of client order size) for subsequent refill orders by customers.\nEmployees\nThe Company currently has two employees, including Mr. Rene Alvarez, Chairman, President, CEO, Treasurer and Secretary and Edgar Gonzales, Director and Vice President.\nMr. Charles Strongo resigned from all Officer positions as well as a member of the Board. All of his functions were delegated to Mr. Rene Alvarez. Also, the Board accepted resignations from Dr. Ciu, Dr. Ford. Dr. Paez de la Cerda, and Wolfgang Groeters; all were appointed by Mr. Strongo. Mr Alvarez is re-constituting the Board at this time and has accepted Mr. Edgar B. Gonzalez to Board membership. It is anticipated that three additional members will be accepted soon. At the present time, we have no full-time employees. Messrs. Alvarez and Gonzalez devote approximately 40 to 60 hours each per week or as much time as is necessary to conduct the affairs of the company. The company utilizes independent contractors when necessary.\nOther Information\nOur website address is www.gwhpcorp.com. The public may read and copy any materials we file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the SECs website at www.sec.gov which site contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, such as us, that file electronically with the SEC. All statements made in any of our filings, including all forward-looking statements, are made as of the date of the document(s) in which the statement is included, and we do not assume or undertake any obligation to update any of those statements or documents unless we are required to do so by law.\nThe Companys executive office is located at 1402 N El Camino Real, San Clemente, CA 92672 The Companys telephone number is (714) 392-9752. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSmaller reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this Item 1A. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. Item 2. Properties\nWe utilized approximately 1,500 square feet of office and warehouse space located at 1402 North El Camino Real, San Clemente, California 92672. The space is leased pursuant to a sublease on a month-to-month basis with monthly rent due of approximately $3,700. Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nSee Note 9 to our financial statements for information related to the Securities and Commission Civil Complaint filed on February 17, 2022. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink tier (the OTCPink) under the symbol GWHP.\nThe market price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in our quarterly operating results, general trends in the market, and other factors, over many of which we have little or no control. In addition, broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, business and political conditions, may adversely affect the market for our common stock, regardless of our actual or projected performance.\nOn May 9, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized a one for five hundred (1:500) reverse stock split which became effective on May 20, 2019. All share amounts contained in this Annual Report reflect this reverse split\nHolders\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 400,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share and 10,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. As of September 8, 2021, there were 384 stockholders of record holding an aggregate of 82,057,885 shares of common stock (this number does not include stockholders who hold their stock through brokers, banks and other nominees). No preferred stock has been issued.\nTransfer Agent\nThe transfer agent of our common stock is Nevada Agency and Transfer Company, having an office at 50 West Liberty Street, Suite 880, Reno, NV 89501; their phone number is (775) 322-0626.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nPenny Stock\nOur common stock trades at less than $5.00 per share and is therefore subject to the Securities and Exchange Commissions penny stock rules.\nPenny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system). Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account. The broker-dealer must also make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction. These requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit their market price and liquidity of our securities. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of our stockholders to resell our common stock.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nNone.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company issued 16,000,000 shares in exchange for services valued at $1,733,100, which includes the issuance of 9,000,000 shares, in total, to the Board of Directors, valued at $387,000.\nDuring fiscal 2022, Firstfire 1) converted $164,000 or principal of Firstfire Note No. 1 at a per share price of $0.03, and received 5,466,666 shares; and 2) converted $31,500 or principal of Firstfire Note No. 2 at a per share price of $0.0063, and received 5,000,000 shares.\nOn July 10, 2021, the Company and LionsGate Funding Management LLC (LGFM) entered into a Media and Marketing Services Agreement (the MMSA). Pursuant to the MMSA, 1) LGFM provided services designed to increase the awareness and visibility in the investment community and market product to distributors throughout the world for a period of 12 months; and 2) the Company will pay LGFM $100,000 and issue 300,000 shares of restricted common stock valued at $129,000. The shares were issued on October 11, 2021. Lionsgate was also issued 2,500,000 shares on January 13, 2022 in exchange for services valued at $215,000.\nThe securities issued above were issued by the Company under the exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, as amended and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder, as the securities were issued to accredited investors, without a view to distribution, and were not issued through any general solicitation or advertisement.\nAdditional Information\nCopies of our annual reports, quarterly reports, current reports, and any amendments to those reports, are available free of charge on the internet at www.sec.gov. All statements made in any of our filings, including all forward-looking statements, are made as of the date of the document(s) in which the statement is included, and we do not assume or undertake any obligation to update any of those statements or documents unless we are required to do so by law.  Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial condition and results of operations\nThe following Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of Global WholeHealth Partners Corporation. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOverview\nGlobal WholeHealth Partners Corporation develops and markets in-vitro diagnostic tests for over-the-counter, or consumer-use and point-of-care which includes hospitals, physicians offices and medical clinics, including those within penal systems throughout the US and abroad. The Company currently markets a range of diagnostic test kits for consumer use through OTC sales, and for use by health care professionals, generally located at medical clinics, physician offices and hospitals known POC, in the United States. These test kits are known as in-vitro diagnostic test kits or IVD products.\nThe Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs to allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we had negative working capital of $1,575,766, and a cash balance of $0. Management recognizes that in order for us to meet our capital requirements, and continue to operate, additional financing will be necessary. During July 2022, the Company sold $239,675 face value of promissory notes from which the Company received $206,250 in proceeds. We expect to raise additional funds through private or public equity investment in order to expand the range and scope of our business operations. We will seek access to private or public equity but there is no assurance that such additional funds will be available for us to finance our operations on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate positive cash flow, it is unlikely that we will be able to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nResults of Operations\nYear ended June 30, 2022 compared with the year ended June 30, 2021\nYear Ended\nJune 30,\nChange\nRevenue $ 7,375 $ 40,196 $ (32,821 )\nCost of revenue 119,681 201,495 (81,814 )\nGross profit (112,306 ) (161,299 ) 48,993\nOperating expenses\nProfessional fees 176,174 83,790 92,384\nResearch and development 1,372,697 481,740 890,957\nSelling, general and administrative 782,650 317,062 465,588\nStock compensation 1,741,800 2,544,000 (802,200 )\nTotal operating expenses 4,073,321 3,426,592 646,729\nLoss from operations (4,185,627 ) (3,587,891 ) (597,736 )\nOther income (expense)\nInterest expense (281,866 ) (64,732 ) (217,134 )\nInterest recorded on compensatory warrants - (737,569 ) 737,569\nAmortization of debt discount (687,460 ) (163,931 ) (523,529 )\nLoss on related party transfer of intangible assets - (4,480,000 ) 4,480,000\nTotal other income (expense) (969,326 ) (5,446,232 ) 4,476,906\nNet loss $ (5,154,953 ) $ (9,034,123 ) $ 3,879,170\nRevenue and Cost of Revenue\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Companys sales included a $7,000 sale to a related party. Sales decreased due to the Companys inability to secure and market test items. The cost of revenue in 2022 and 2021 included inventory adjustments of $115,681 and 171,811, respectively, due to shelf-life expiration of our products\nProfessional Fees\nProfessional fees relate to expenditures incurred primarily for legal, accounting and financing services. During fiscal 2022 professional fees increased primarily due to higher legal fees incurred related to the February 17, 2022 Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit filed in the federal district court for the Southern District of California, for additional information see the notes to our financial statements, NOTE 9 - Commitments and Contingencies.\nResearch and Product Development\nResearch and Product Development (R&D) costs represent costs incurred to develop our tests and are incurred pursuant to certain internal R&D cost allocations, when applicable, and agreements with third-party providers, but primarily with Pan Probe Biotech, owned by Dr. Shujie Cui, our Chief Science Officer. R&D costs are expensed when incurred. During fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, R&D costs increased due to the development of a COVID antigen test.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs include all expenditures related to personnel, rent, travel, public company costs, utilities, marketing and other office related costs. SG&A costs increased during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 due increases in personnel costs of $127,500, travel and meals of $38,020, rent of $84,427, utilities of $31,363, impairment charges of $26,418, marketing costs of $155,672 and other SG&A costs of $2,188.\nStock Compensation\nStock compensation represents the expense associated with the issuance of stock in exchange for services and is non-cash in nature. Stock compensation is based on our stock price at the measurement date and can fluctuate significantly as a result. Stock compensation expense in fiscal 2022 consisted of the issuance of 16,000,000 shares of restricted common stock at a weighted average price of $0.11 per share compared to the fiscal 2021 issuance of 2,950,000 shares of restricted common stock at a weighted average price of $0.86 per share. All shares were issued free of obligation.\nOther Income and (Expense)\nOther expense includes interest expense which relates to the stated interest and penalties upon default of our outstanding promissory notes, and amortization of debt discount which represents the accretion of the discount applied to our notes as a result of the issuance of detachable warrants, the beneficial conversion feature contained certain notes and deductions from the proceeds of the promissory notes for various related fees. During fiscal 2022, interest expense included $191,400 of liquidated damages and penalties due to our default on the Firstfire Notes and $79,200 of interest expense related to the Firstfire Notes and $90,466 related to our promissory notes.\nDuring fiscal 2021, the company recognized $64,732 of interest expense related to your outstanding promissory notes and $737,569 related to the July 22, 2020 Common Stock Purchase Agreement with EMC2 Capital, LLC and related Commitment Warrants valued at $737,569.\nThe loss on related party transfer of intangible assets represents value of two separate, exclusive, five-year, license agreements between the Company and Charles Strongo, our former CEO, one for the manufacture of Biodegradable plastic for medical devices under provisional patent 63/054,139 and the second license agreement for the use of the intellectual property described as a Rapid, Micro-Well or Later flow test for Parkinsons, Dementia, or Alzheimer or ASD (collectively, the License Agreements). The License Agreements were both executed on January 12, 2021 and March 30, 2021. In exchange for entering into the License Agreements, the Company issued a total of 8 million shares of restricted common stock with a market value of $4,480,000. Due to this being a related party transfer with no available historical cost records, the full value of the stock issued was recorded as a loss.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of June 30, 2022, the Company had no cash and a bank overdraft of $1,230 and current liabilities of $1,719,380. From inception to June 30, 2022, we have incurred an accumulated deficit of $18,937,685. This loss has been incurred through a combination of professional fees, R&D, SG&A and non-cash stock related costs of $13,235,369 to support our plans to develop our business. During fiscal 2022, the Company had negligible revenues and used cash in operations of $1,968,207. The Company has incurred losses since inception and may not be able to generate sufficient net revenue from its business in the future to achieve or sustain profitability. The Company currently has insufficient funds to operate over the next twelve months. To finance our operations, we have entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with EMC2 Capital LLC, which provided us with $1,476,872 during fiscal 2022. Additionally, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement and related 12% senior secured convertible promissory note on June 18, 2021 and August 27, 2021, under which the Company received net proceeds of $224,500 on July 8, 2021 and $313,700 on September 2, 2021. Subsequent to fiscal 2022, in July 2022, the Company sold $239,675 face value of promissory notes from which the Company received $206,250 in proceeds. We are currently pursuing additional funds through equity or debt financing or a combination thereof. However, aside from the EMC2 SPA, the Company has no commitments to obtain any such financing, and there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nPresented below is a table that summarizes the cash provided or used in our activities and the amount of the respective increases or decreases in cash provided by (used in) those activities between the fiscal periods:\nYear Ended\nJune 30,\nChange\nOperating activities $ (1,968,207 ) $ (642,802 ) $ (1,325,405 )\nInvesting activities - (3,505 ) 3,505\nFinancing activities 1,893,505 706,512 1,186,993\nNet increase (decrease) in cash $ (74,702 ) $ 60,205 $ (134,907 )\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities increased primarily due to increases in R&D, professional fees, personnel and other SG&A costs.\nInvesting Activities\nThe Company purchased computer equipment totaling $3,505 in fiscal 2021 .\nFinancing Activities\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company received $1,478,870 upon the sale of 7,856,514 shares of common stock, $2,000 upon the issuance of 2,000,000 shares pursuant to a warrant exercise, and $538,200 from the sale of convertible promissory notes offset by debt payments totaling $123,565.\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Company received $680,051 upon the sale of 1,235,961 shares of common stock, $162,000 from the sale of convertible promissory notes, $75,000 from the sale of promissory notes and $144,576 from the sale of a related party note offset by payments of $73,000 on convertible promissory notes, $15,845 on promissory notes and $266,270 on related party notes.\nContractual Obligations\nNone.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on its historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nDue to the level of activity and lack of complex transactions, we believe there are currently no critical accounting policies and estimates that affect the preparation of our financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee NOTE 2 - Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRelated Party Transactions\nFor a discussion of our Related Party Transactions, see Note 5 - Transactions With Related Persons to our Financial Statements included under Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nSmaller reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item. Item 8. Financial Statements\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nBalance Sheets as of June 30, 2022 and 2021\nStatements of Operations for the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021\nStatements of Stockholders Equity (Deficit) for the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021\nStatements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the shareholders and the board of directors of Global WholeHealth Partners Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global WholeHealth Partners Corporation as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nSubstantial Doubt about the Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1.

Organization and Going Concern\nOrganization\nGlobal WholeHealth Partners Corporation was incorporated on March 7, 2013 in the State of Nevada under the name Texas Jack Oil and Gas Corp. On May 9, 2019, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to effect a change of name to Global WholeHealth Partners Corporation. The Companys ticker symbol changed to GWHP.\nThe Company develops and markets in-vitro diagnostic tests. The Company has developed over 125 Diagnostic Tests with the criteria that they be low cost, OTC or self-administered, absolutely accurate, and provide immediate results. The Company has 45 FDA approved tests for distribution in the US which include tests for Troponin, Colorectal, and Drug testing among others. The remainder tests carry an FDA Certificate of Exportability for distribution in foreign countries and include tests such as Ebola, ZIKA, Dengue Fever, Malaria, Influenza, Tuberculosis, Yellow Fever, Corona Viruses, and other epidemic and vector borne diseases.\nGoing Concern\nThe Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs to allow it to continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company incurred negative operating cash flows of $1,968,2071,968,000 for the year ended June 30, 2022 and has an accumulated deficit of $18,937,68518,943,000 from inception through June 30, 2022. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable.\nIn view of these conditions, the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is in substantial doubt and dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations and on the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to fund ongoing operations. Historically, the Company has relied upon internally generated funds, and funds from the sale of stock, issuance of promissory notes and loans from its shareholders and private investors to finance its operations and growth. Management is planning to raise necessary additional funds for working capital through loans and/or additional sales of its common stock. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising additional capital or that such additional funds will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Should the Company be unable to raise this amount of capital its operating plans will be limited to the amount of capital that it can access. These consolidated financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments which will be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern and therefore be required to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts different from those reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates made by management primarily relate to accounts receivable, inventories, deferred income tax valuation allowances, and identifiable intangible assets.\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less and money market accounts to be cash equivalents.\nInventory\nInventory is comprised of finished goods and stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventory cost is determined on a weighted average basis in accordance with ASC 330-10-30-9. Provisions are made to reduce slow-moving, obsolete, or unusable inventories to their estimated useful or scrap values. When necessary, the Company establishes reserves for this purpose. During the year ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized $115,681 and $171,811, respectively, of adjustments to reduce the value of inventory due primarily to the reduction in selling prices and expiration of test kits.\nEquipment\nFixed assets are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Major improvements are capitalized, while repair and maintenance are expensed when incurred. Renewals and betterments that materially extend the life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in that period.\nDepreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are:\nSummary of Estimated Useful Lives of Depreciable Assets\nEstimated\nUseful Lives\nComputer equipment and software 3 years\nEquipment, furniture and fixtures 5 years\nIntangible assets\nOther definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. The Company reviews the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from operations through the sale of products. Product revenue is comprised of the sale of consumables. To date, all products sold have been fully paid for in advance of shipment.\nRevenue is recognized when control of products and services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive from the customer in exchange for those products and services. This process involves identifying the contract with the customer, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, if applicable, and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied. A performance obligation is considered distinct from other obligations in a contract when it provides a benefit to the customer either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and is separately identified in the contract. The Company considers a performance obligation satisfied once it has transferred control of a good or service to the customer, meaning the customer has the ability to use and obtain the benefit of the good or service. The Company recognizes revenue for satisfied performance obligations only when it determines there are no uncertainties regarding payment terms or transfer of control.\nRevenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment to the end customer, which is when control of the product is deemed to be transferred. Invoicing typically occurs prior to shipment and the term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant.\nRevenue is recorded net of discounts, and sales taxes collected on behalf of governmental authorities. Sales commissions are recorded as selling and marketing expenses when incurred.\nThe Company records any payments received from customers prior to the Company fulfilling its performance obligation(s) as deferred revenue.\nThe Company had one customer that represented 57.2% of revenue for the year ended June 30, 2021. The Company had three customers that represented 87.6% of revenue (59.6%, 17.4% and 10.6%) for the year ended June 30, 2020. No other customers represented greater than 10% of sales.\nConcentration of Credit Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Risk\nThe Company has no significant off-balance-sheet risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts, or other foreign hedging arrangements. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash. The Companys policy is to place its cash in high quality financial institutions. The Company does not believe significant credit risk exists with respect to these institutions.\nLeases\nThe Company recognizes leases with a term of greater than a year on the balance sheet by recording right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Leases can be classified as either operating leases or finance leases. Operating leases will result in straight-line lease expense, while finance leases will result in front-loaded expense. The Companys lease consists of an operating lease for office space. The Company does not recognize a lease liability or right-of-use asset on the balance sheet for short-term leases. Instead, the Company recognizes short-term lease payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. A short-term lease is defined as a lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company utilizes a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). These tiers include:\nLevel 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;\nLevel 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and\nLevel 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\nDuring the periods covered by this report, the Company did not have any assets or liabilities that were required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis or on a non-recurring basis.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Companys financial instruments consist of accounts payable and accrued expenses. The carrying amounts of the Companys financial instruments approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these items. These fair value estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect those estimates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes, nor do we utilize derivative instruments.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain income tax positions, if any, taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. Estimated interest and penalties are recorded as a component of interest expense or other expense, respectively.\nTransactions with Related Parties\nParties are considered to be related to the Company if the parties directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control, are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal stockholders of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal stockholders of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal where one-party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The Company discloses all material related-party transactions. All transactions shall be recorded at fair value of the goods or services exchanged. Property purchased from a related party is recorded at the cost to the related party and any payment to or on behalf of the related party in excess of the cost is reflected as compensation or distribution to related parties depending on the transaction.\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common share equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method. Dilutive common stock equivalents are comprised of convertible notes and warrants to purchase common stock. For all periods presented, there is no difference in the number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted shares outstanding due to the Companys net loss position.\nThe potentially dilutive securities that would be anti-dilutive due to the Companys net loss are not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders. The anti-dilutive securities are as follows (in common stock equivalent shares):\nSchedule of Potentially Dilutive Securities in common stock equivalent shares\nYear Ended\nJune 30,\nYear Ended\nJune 30,\nCommon stock warrants 546,975 2,216,975\nConvertible promissory notes 131,535,144 10,354\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs primarily consist of research contracts for the advancement of product development. The Company expenses all research and development costs in the period incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718, Stock Based Compensation. ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to directors, employees and consultants, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. If a stock-based award contains performance-based conditions, at the point that it becomes probable that the performance conditions will be met, the Company records a cumulative catch-up of the expense from the grant date to the current date, and then amortizes the remainder of the expense over the remaining service period. Management evaluates when the achievement of a performance-based condition is probable based on the expected satisfaction of the performance conditions as of the reporting date.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nWe evaluate all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for consideration of their applicability. ASUs not included in our disclosures were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nNone.\nAccounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity (ASU 2020-06), which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current U.S. GAAP. ASU 2020-06 removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception and it also simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. ASU 2020-06 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and adoption must be as of the beginning of the Companys annual fiscal year. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 beginning with our fiscal year starting on July 1, 2021 with no impact on its Financial Statements.\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01 - Investments - Equity securities (Topic 321), Investments - Equity method and joint ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and hedging (Topic 815) - Clarifying the interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815. The amendments in this Update improve the accounting for certain equity securities upon the application or discontinuation of the equity method of accounting and clarify the scope considerations for forward contracts and purchased options on certain securities. The amendments are effective for public entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2020-01 beginning with our fiscal year starting on July 1, 2021 with no impact on its Financial Statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The guidance removes certain exceptions for recognizing deferred taxes for equity method investments, performing intra period allocation, and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The ASU also adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas, including recognizing deferred taxes for goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group, among others. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption of the standard is permitted, including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The transition requirements are dependent upon each amendment within this update and will be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 effective July 1, 2021 with no impact on its Financial Statements.\nNOTE 3 - Equipment\nEquipment consists of the following:\nSummary Of Equipment\nJune 30,\nComputers, office equipment and software $ 3,505 $ 3,505\nTotal equipment 3,505 3,505\nAccumulated depreciation (2,230 ) (1,067 )\nEquipment, net $ 1,274 $ 2,438\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company purchased $3,505 of computer equipment.

Realization of the future tax benefits related to the deferred tax assets is dependent on many factors, including the Companys ability to generate taxable income within the net operating loss carryforward period. Management has considered these factors in reaching its conclusion as to the valuation allowance for financial reporting purposes and has recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets at June 30, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nSchedule Of Deferred Tax Assets\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss carryforwards $ 3,994,223 $ 1,275,168\nStatutory tax rate 21 % 21 %\nTotal deferred tax assets 838,787 267,785\nLess: valuation allowance (838,787 ) (267,785 )\nNet deferred tax asset $ - $ -\nA reconciliation between the amount of income tax benefit determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory income tax rate to pre-tax loss for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\nSchedule Of Reconciliation Of Income Tax Rates\nFederal Statutory Rate $ 1,082,540 $ 1,897,166\nNondeductible expenses (511,539 ) (1,664,355 )\nChange in allowance on deferred tax assets 571,001 232,811\nIncome tax benefit $ - $ -\nThe net increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was $571,002 and $232,811 for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Due to the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax asset, management has recorded a valuation allowance against the entire deferred tax asset.\nFor federal income tax purposes, the Company has net U.S. operating loss carry forwards at June 30, 2022 available to offset future federal taxable income, if any, of approximately $3,994,223. The utilization of the tax net operating loss carry forwards may be limited due to ownership changes that have occurred as a result of sales of common stock.\nThe fiscal years 2019 through 2021 remain open to examination by federal authorities and other jurisdictions in which the Company operates.\nNOTE 9 - Commitments and Contingencies\nOn September 14, 2021, the Company leased 6,900 square feet of office and light industrial space located at 1130 Calle Cordillera, San Clemente, California. See Note 6 - Leases and Note 10 - Subsequent Events for additional information.\nOn February 17, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit in the federal district court for the Southern District of California, charging the Company, former CEO Charles Strongo, and four stock promoters with violations of section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The SECs complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of funds allegedly received from illegal conduct plus pre-judgment interest, and the civil penalties. On the same day, the US Attorneys Office for the Southern District of California announced the unsealing of an indictment charging Mr. Strongo and the promoters with conspiring to manipulate the market for the Companys stock in an alleged pump-and-dump scheme through allegedly false and misleading statements in press releases and SEC filings concerning the Companys emergency use authorization submissions to the Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 tests. The matter is presently stayed pending the conclusion of the criminal case, United States of America v. Brian Volmer et. al., United States District Court, Southern District Case No. 21-cr-1310-WQH, in which Mr. Strongo is also named as a defendant. Mr. Strongo adamantly denies the allegations and has entered a plea of not guilty to the charges. Total legal costs recognized through fiscal 2022 were $72,949. Due to the nature and early stage of the SEC Action, the Company is unable to estimate the total costs to defend itself or the potential costs to the Company in the event that it is not successful in its defense.\nNOTE 10 - Subsequent Events\nManagement has reviewed material events subsequent of the period ended June 30, 2022 and prior to the filing of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with FASB ASC 855 Subsequent Events.\nOn July 25, 2022, Firstfire converted $29,750 of principal under the Firstfire Note 2 and received 5,000,000 shares of common stock.\nOn Agust 3, 2022, Firstfire converted $20,000 of principal under the Firstfire Note 2 and received 5,000,000 shares of common stock.\nOn September 6, 2022, Firstfire converted $23,100 of principal under the Firstfire Note 2 and received 5,000,000 shares of common stock.\nOn July 13, 2022, the Company received a notice to pay rent or surrender the premises located at 1130 Calle Cordillera, San Clemente, California due to non payment of rent for the months of April 2022 - July 2022 and totaling $35,391. In mid August 2022, the Company surrendered the premises and the deposit of $32,621 towards payment of the balance owed.\nOn July 21, 2022, the Company and 1800 Diagonal Lending LLC (1800 Diagonal) entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the 1800 Diagonal SPA). Pursuant to the 1800 Diagonal SPA, the Company sold to 1800 Diagonal a Promissory Note for the principal amount of $114,675 (the 1800 Diagonal Promissory Note). Pursuant to the 1800 Diagonal Promissory Note the Company received net proceeds of $100,000 which included deductions for a $10,425 original issue discount, $3,000 for legal fees and $1,250 as a due diligence fee. The 1800 Diagonal Promissory Note matures in one (1) year, requires no payments until maturity, is unsecured and subject to customary remedies upon default. Beginning 180 days for the date of the 1800 Diagonal Promissory Note, the 1800 Diagonal Promissory Note becomes, at the option of 1800 Diagonal, convertible into shares of common stock at an exercise price of 75% multiplied by the average of the three lowest closing bid prices over the 15 days prior to the conversion date. 1800 Diagonal has agreed to restrict its ability to convert the 1800 Diagonal Promissory Note and receive shares of common stock such that the number of shares of common stock held by them in the aggregate and their affiliates after such conversion or exercise does not exceed 4.99% of the then issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The 1800 Diagonal Promissory Note represents a debt obligation arising other than in the ordinary course of business, which constitutes a direct financial obligation of the Company. The foregoing summary of the 1800 Diagonal SPA and 1800 Diahonal Promissory Note does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 1800 Diagonal SPA and 1800 Diahonal Promissory Note which are filed herewith by the Company as Exhibit 10.12 and 10.13, respectively, to this report.\nOn July 27, 2022, the Company and Coventry Enterprises LLC (Coventry) entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Coventry SPA). Pursuant to the Coventry SPA, the Company sold to Coventry a promissory note for the principal amount of $125,000 (the Coventry Note) and agreed to issue 1,000,000 shares of common stock (the Common Stock Fee). Pursuant to the Coventry Note, the Company received net proceeds of $106,250 which included deductions for an original issue discount of $18,750. Also, the Company paid a 3rd party broker the sum of $7,000 as a commission related to the Coventry Note. The Coventry Note includes 10% or $12,500 of guaranteed interest, matures in one (1) year, requires seven payments of $19,642.85 beginning December 27, 2022, is unsecured and subject to customary remedies upon default, including accruing interest at 18% and becoming convertible into common stock at a conversion price per share equal to 90% of the lowest per-share trading price during the twenty (20) trading day period before the conversion. The Coventry Note represents a debt obligation arising other than in the ordinary course of business, which constitutes a direct financial obligation of the Company. The foregoing summary of the Coventry SPA and Coventry Note does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Coventry SPA and Coventry Note which are filed herewith by the Company as Exhibit 10.14 and 10.15, respectively, to this report. As a result of the original issue discount, the Common Stock Fee valued at $9,000, and the $7,000 broker commission, the Company recorded a debt discount of $34,750 which is being accreted over the term of the Coventry Note.

At this time, after considering all of the relevant facts and circumstances, our Board has determined that Wolfgang Groeters and qualify as an independent director.

We face a number of risks, including strategic risks, enterprise risks, financial risks, and regulatory risks.

Our employees are expected to disclose personal interests that may conflict with ours and they may not engage in personal activities that conflict with their responsibilities and obligations to us.

An interested related party who serves on the Board shall recuse their self from the review and approval of a related party transaction in which they have an interest in the transaction. In the event of a potential conflict of interest, the Board will generally evaluate the transaction in terms of the following standards: (i) the benefits to us; (ii) the impact on a directors independence in the event the related person is a director, an immediate family member of a director or an entity in which a director is a partner, shareholder or executive officer; (iii) the availability of other sources for comparable products or services; (iv) the terms and conditions of the transaction; and (v) the terms available to unrelated parties or the employees generally.\nThe following is a description of each transaction since the beginning of 2019, and each currently proposed transaction, in which:\n\u25cf we have been or are to be a participant;\n\u25cf the amount involved exceeds the lesser of $120,000 or 1% of the average of our total assets for the last two completed fiscal years; and\n\u25cf any of our directors, executive officers or holders of more than 5% of any class of our capital stock at the time of the transactions in issue, or any immediate family member of or person sharing the household with any of these individuals, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.\nFor additional information see NOTE 5 - Transactions with Related Persons, under Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nDirector Independence\nPlease refer to Director Independence under the section titled CORPORATE GOVERNANCE in ITEM 10.
