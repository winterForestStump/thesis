    "content": "Item 1. Business.\nOVERVIEW\nRCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. is a holding company. Through our subsidiaries, we engaged in a number of activities in the hospitality and other businesses. As of September 30, 2022, our subsidiaries operated a total of 63 establishments that offer live adult entertainment and/or restaurant and bar operations, including 1 location that was temporarily closed. Together with its subsidiaries, RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. is collectively referred to as RCIHH, the Company, we, us, or our in this report. We also operate a leading business communications company serving the multibillion-dollar adult nightclubs industry. RCIHH was incorporated in the State of Texas in 1994 and became public in 1995.\nOur fiscal year ends on September 30. References to years 2022, 2021, and 2020 are for fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Our fiscal quarters chronologically end on December 31, March 31, June 30 and September 30.\nOur corporate website address is www.rcihospitality.com. Upon written request, we make available free of charge our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (www.sec.gov). Information contained in the corporate website shall not be construed as part of this Form 10-K.\nCURRENT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT\nOur fiscal 2020 was the period hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic causing a significant reduction in customer traffic in our clubs and restaurants due to changes in consumer behavior as social distancing practices, dining room closures and other restrictions were mandated or encouraged by federal, state and local governments. In fiscal 2021, our businesses started to recover from the initial effects of the pandemic when government restrictions eased. Stimulus money also flowed to the economy at that time which prompted discretionary spending. In fiscal 2022, several coronavirus variants threatened to bring back tight restrictions. Along with the pandemic, geopolitical and macroeconomic events started to affect the U.S. economy in general, with global inflation and supply chain disruption impacting our businesses.\nGeopolitical and macroeconomic events are still developing. In the event global inflation leads to a major economic downturn, our business operations and cash flow could be significantly affected.\nOUR BUSINESS\nWe operate several businesses, which we aggregate for financial reporting purposes into two reportable segments - Nightclubs and Bombshells. Businesses that are not included as Nightclubs or Bombshells are combined as Other.\nDuring fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, on a consolidated basis, revenues were $267.6 million, $195.3 million, and $132.3 million, respectively, generating diluted earnings (loss) per share of $4.91, $3.37, and $(0.66), respectively. Fiscal 2020 was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe table below shows the number of Nightclubs and Bombshells open by state as of September 30, 2022:\nNightclubs Bombshells(1)\nTotal\nArizona 1 - 1\nColorado 5 - 5\nFlorida 4 - 4\nIllinois 5 - 5\nIndiana 1 - 1\nKentucky 1 - 1\nLouisiana 1 - 1\nMaine 1 - 1\nMinnesota 3 - 3\nNew York 4 - 4\nNorth Carolina 2 - 2\nPennsylvania 1 - 1\nTexas 23 12 35\n52 12 64\n(1) Includes one franchised location.\nNightclubs Segment\nWe operate our adult entertainment nightclubs through several brands that target many different demographics of customers by providing a unique, quality entertainment environment. Our clubs do business as Ricks Cabaret, Jaguars Club, Tootsies Cabaret, XTC Cabaret, Club Onyx, Hoops Cabaret and Sports Bar, Scarletts Cabaret, Diamond Cabaret, Cheetah Gentlemen's Club, PT's Showclub, Playmates Club, Country Rock Cabaret, La Boheme Gentlemen's Cabaret, Temptations Adult Cabaret, Foxys Cabaret, Vivid Cabaret, Downtown Cabaret, Cabaret East, The Seville, Silver City Cabaret, Heartbreakers Gentlemen's Club, and Kappa Mens Club. We also operate one dance club under the brand name Studio 80.\nWe generate revenue from our nightclubs through the sale of alcoholic beverages, food, and merchandise items; service in the form of cover charge, licensing fees, and room rentals; and through other related means such as ATM commissions and vending income, among others.\nDuring fiscal 2022, our Nightclub segment sales mix was 45% service revenue; 39% alcoholic beverages; and 16% food, merchandise and other. Segment gross margin (revenues less cost of goods sold, divided by revenues) was approximately 90%. Our Nightclubs segment revenue increased by 50% and income from operations increased by more than 89% compared to the prior year. Same-stores sales for Nightclubs in 2022 was +10.1%.\nDuring fiscal 2022, we acquired 15 gentlemens clubs, certain related real estate properties, and associated intellectual property through five different transactions with an aggregate acquisition price of $132.6 million. These 15 clubs contributed $41.9 million in revenues during fiscal 2022. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for details of the transactions.\nFor a list of our nightclub locations, refer to Item 2 - Properties.\nBombshells Segment\nOur Bombshells segment operates a restaurant and bar concept that sets itself apart with d\u00e9cor that pays homage to all branches of the U.S. military. Locations feature local DJs, large outdoor patios, and more than 75 state-of-the-art flat screen TVs for watching your favorite sports. All food and drink menu items have military names. Bombshell Girls, with their military-inspired uniforms, are a key attraction. Their mission, in addition to waitressing, is to interact with guests and generate a fun atmosphere. Bombshells is also franchising under our subsidiary, BMB Franchising Services, Inc., which has been approved to sell franchises in all 50 states. On December 22, 2020, the Company signed a franchise development agreement with a group of private investors to open three Bombshells locations in San Antonio, Texas over a period of five\nyears, and the right of first refusal for three more locations in Corpus Christi, New Braunfels, and San Marcos, all in Texas. On May 2, 2022, the Company signed its second franchise development agreement with a private investor to open three Bombshells locations in the state of Alabama over a period of five years. We opened one company-owned location in Arlington, Texas (Dallas area) in December 2021 and our first franchised location opened in June 2022 in San Antonio, Texas. As of September 30, 2022, we have eleven company-owned Bombshells locations, all in Texas with two in the Dallas area, one in Austin, and eight in the Greater Houston area. We also currently have one franchised location in San Antonio, Texas.\nDuring fiscal 2022, Bombshells sales mix was 56% alcoholic beverages and 44% food, merchandise, and other. Segment gross margin (revenues less cost of goods sold, divided by revenues) was approximately 77%. We grew Bombshells segment revenue by 5.8%, while income from operations decreased by 13.3% from prior year. Same-stores sales for Bombshells in 2022 was -4.6%.\nFor a list of our Bombshells locations, refer to Item 2 - Properties.\nOther Segment\nWe group together all businesses not belonging to either Nightclubs and Bombshells as Other reportable segment. This is made up of several wholly-owned subsidiaries composed primarily of our Media Group and Drink Robust. Our Media Group is the leading business communications company serving the multibillion-dollar adult nightclubs industry and the adult retail products industry. It owns a national industry convention and tradeshow; two national industry trade publications; two national industry award shows; and more than a dozen industry and social media websites. Included in the Media Group is ED Publications, publishers of the bimonthly ED Club Bulletin, the only national business magazine serving the 2,200-plus adult nightclubs in North America, which collectively have annual revenues in excess of $5 billion, according to the Association of Club Executives. ED Publications, founded in 1991, also publishes the Annual VIP Guide of adult nightclubs, touring entertainers and industry vendors; and produces the Annual Gentlemens Club Owners EXPO, a national convention and tradeshow. The Media Group produces two nationally recognized industry award shows for the readers of both ED Club Bulletin and StorErotica magazines, and maintains a number of B-to-B and consumer websites for both industries. Drink Robust is licensed to sell Robust Energy Drink in the United States.\nOUR STRATEGY\nOur overall objective is to create value for our shareholders by developing and operating profitable businesses in the hospitality and related space. We strive to achieve that by providing an attractive price-value entertainment, dining experience, and top-notch service; by attracting and retaining quality personnel; and by focusing on unit-level operating performance. Aside from our operating strategy, we employ a capital allocation strategy.\nCapital Allocation Strategy\nOur capital allocation strategy provides us with disciplined guidelines on how we should use our free cash flows; provided however, that we may deviate from this strategy if other strategic rationale warrants. We calculate free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities minus maintenance capital expenditures. Using the after-tax yield of buying our own stock as baseline, management believes that we are able to make better investment decisions.\nBased on our current capital allocation strategy:\nWe consider acquiring or developing our own clubs or restaurants that we believe have the potential to provide a minimum cash on cash return of 25%-33%, absent an otherwise strategic rationale;\nWe consider disposing of underperforming units to free up capital for more productive use;\nWe consider buying back our own stock if the after-tax yield on free cash flow is above 10%;\nWe consider paying down our most expensive debt if it makes sense on a tax-adjusted basis, or there is an otherwise strategic rationale.\nOver a five-year period from fiscal 2017 up to fiscal 2022, we improved diluted earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42.0%, which was mainly caused by increasing revenue at a CAGR of 13.1%, and flowing through net income at a CAGR of 41.0%. As a result, net cash provided by operating activities improved at 25.1% and free cash flow at 25.0% CAGR for the same period. See discussions of our non-GAAP financial measures starting on page 37.\nCOMPETITION\nThe adult entertainment and the restaurant/sports bar businesses are highly competitive with respect to price, service and location. All of our nightclubs compete with a number of locally owned adult clubs, some of whose brands may have name recognition that equals that of ours. The names Ricks and Ricks Cabaret, Tootsies Cabaret, XTC Cabaret, Scarletts, Silver City, Club Onyx, Downtown Cabaret, Temptations, The Seville, Jaguars, Hoops Cabaret, Foxys Cabaret, Mile High Mens Club, Country Rock Cabaret, PTs, and Diamond Cabaret are proprietary. In the restaurant/sports bar business, Bombshells is also proprietary. We believe that the combination of our existing brand name recognition and the distinctive entertainment environment that we have created allows us to compete effectively in the industry and within the cities where we operate. Although we believe that we are well positioned to compete successfully, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our high level of name recognition and prestige within the marketplace.\nGOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business activities. Particularly in Texas, the authority to issue a permit to sell alcoholic beverages is governed by the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (TABC), which has the authority, in its discretion, to issue the appropriate permits. We presently hold a Mixed Beverage Permit and a Late Hour Permit at numerous Texas locations. Minnesota, North Carolina, Louisiana, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Florida, New York, and Illinois have similar laws that may limit the availability of a permit to sell alcoholic beverages or that may provide for suspension or revocation of a permit to sell alcoholic beverages in certain circumstances. It is our policy, prior to expanding into any new market, to take steps to ensure compliance with all licensing and regulatory requirements for the sale of alcoholic beverages, as well as the sale of food.\nIn addition to various regulatory requirements affecting the sale of alcoholic beverages, in many cities where we operate, the location of an adult entertainment cabaret is subject to restriction by city, county or other governmental ordinance. The prohibitions deal generally with distance from schools, churches and other sexually oriented businesses, and contain restrictions based on the percentage of residences within the immediate vicinity of the sexually oriented business. The granting of a sexually oriented business permit is not subject to discretion; the permit must be granted if the proposed operation satisfies the requirements of the ordinance. In all states where we operate, management believes we are in compliance with applicable city, county, state or other local laws governing the sale of alcohol and sexually oriented businesses.\nIn relation to our acquisitions during fiscal 2022, we now have club locations in Denver, Colorado; Louisville, Kentucky; Raleigh, North Carolina; Portland, Maine; Indianapolis, Indiana; Sauget, Illinois; Newburgh, New York; and Hallandale Beach and Coral Gables, Florida.\nTRADEMARKS\nOur rights to the trade names RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc., Ricks, Ricks Cabaret, Tootsies Cabaret, Club Onyx, XTC Cabaret, Temptations, Jaguars, Downtown Cabaret, Cabaret East, Bombshells Restaurant and Bar, Vee Lounge, Mile High Mens Club, Country Rock Cabaret, PTs, and Diamond Cabaret are established under common law, based upon our substantial and continuous use of these trade names in interstate commerce, some of which have been in use at least as early as 1987. We have registered our service mark, RICKS AND STARS DESIGN, and the BOMBSHELLS RESTAURANT & BAR logo design with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have also obtained service mark registrations from the Patent and Trademark Office for RICKS AND STARS DESIGN logo, RCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC., RICKS, RICKS CABARET, CLUB ONYX, XTC CABARET, SCARLETTS CABARET, SILVER CITY CABARET, BOMBSHELLS RESTAURANT AND BAR, THE SEVILLE CLUB, DOWN IN TEXAS SALOON, CLUB DULCE, THE BLACK ORCHID, HOOPS CABARET, VEE LOUNGE, STUDIO 80, FOXYS CABARET, EXOTIC DANCER, TOYS FOR TATAS, \"LA BOHEME GENTLEMAN'S CLUB,\" MILE HIGH MENS CLUB, MHMC logo, AFTER DARK, COUNTRY ROCK CABARET, PTS, DIAMOND CABARET, and BOMBSHELLS OFFICERS CLUB are registered through service mark registrations issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. As of this date, we have pending\nregistration applications for the names TOOTSIES CABARET, IN THE BIZ, JAGUARS, 'KNOCKERS BAR & GRILL,\" and THE MANSION. We also own the rights to numerous trade names associated with our media division. There can be no assurance that these steps we have taken to protect our service marks will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our protected intellectual property rights.\nEMPLOYEES AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS\nOur people are employed by the parent company or by its subsidiaries. Executive officers are employed by the registrant (parent company); shared services personnel and managers responsible for multiple clubs or restaurants are employed by RCI Management Services, Inc.; and the rest are employed by the individual operating entities. As of September 30, 2022, we had the following employees:\nOperations\nManagers Non-Managers Corporate Total\nHourly 23 2,704 25 2,752\nSalaried 356 41 70 467\n379 2,745 95 3,219\nAdditionally, as of September 30, 2022, we had independent contractor entertainers who are self-employed and conduct business at our locations on a non-exclusive basis. Our entertainers at Ricks Cabaret in Minneapolis, Minnesota and at Jaguars Club in Phoenix, Arizona act as commissioned employees. All employees and independent contractors sign arbitration non-class-action participation agreements, where allowed by federal and state laws. None of our employees are represented by a union. We consider our employee relations to be good.\nWe believe that the adult entertainment industry standard of treating entertainers as independent contractors provides us with safe harbor protection to preclude payroll tax assessment. We have prepared plans that we believe will protect our profitability in the event that the sexually oriented business industry is required in all states to convert entertainers, who are now independent contractors, into employees. See related discussion in Risk Factors below. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before deciding to purchase shares of our common stock. If any of the events, contingencies, circumstances or conditions described in the risks below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock could, in turn, decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nA summary of our risk factors is as follows:\nRisks related to general macroeconomic and safety conditions\n\u25e6The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt our business, which has and could continue to materially affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations for an extended period of time.\n\u25e6Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\u25e6If we are unable to maintain compliance with certain of our debt covenants or unable to obtain waivers, we may be unable to make additional borrowings and be declared in default where our debt will be made immediately due and payable. In addition, global economic conditions may make it more difficult to access new credit facilities.\n\u25e6We have recorded impairment charges in current and past periods and may record additional impairment charges in future periods.\nRisks related to regulations and/or regulatory agencies\n\u25e6Our business operations are subject to regulatory uncertainties which may affect our ability to continue operations of existing nightclubs, acquire additional nightclubs, or be profitable.\n\u25e6The adult entertainment industry standard is to classify adult entertainers as independent contractors, not employees. If federal or state law mandates that they be classified as employees, our business could be adversely impacted.\n\u25e6Our revenues could be significantly affected by limitations relating to permits to sell alcoholic beverages.\n\u25e6Activities or conduct at our nightclubs may cause us to lose necessary business licenses, expose us to liability, or result in adverse publicity, which may increase our costs and divert managements attention from our business.\nRisks related to our business\n\u25e6We may deviate from our present capital allocation strategy.\n\u25e6We may need additional financing, or our business expansion plans may be significantly limited.\n\u25e6There is substantial competition in the nightclub entertainment industry, which may affect our ability to operate profitably or acquire additional clubs.\n\u25e6The adult entertainment industry is extremely volatile.\n\u25e6Private advocacy group actions targeted at the kind of adult entertainment we offer could result in limitations and our inability to operate in certain locations and negatively impact our business.\n\u25e6We rely heavily on information technology in our operations and any material failure, weakness, interruption or breach of security could prevent us from effectively operating our business.\n\u25e6Security breaches of confidential customer information or personal employee information may adversely affect our business.\n\u25e6Our acquisitions may result in disruptions in our business and diversion of managements attention.\n\u25e6We face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees and licensees.\n\u25e6The impact of new club or restaurant openings could result in fluctuations in our financial performance.\n\u25e6Our ability to grow sales through delivery orders is uncertain.\n\u25e6We incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management devotes substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\n\u25e6We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.\n\u25e6We may have uninsured risks in excess of our insurance coverage.\n\u25e6Our previous liability insurer may be unable to provide coverage to us and our subsidiaries.\n\u25e6The protection provided by our service marks is limited.\n\u25e6We are dependent on key personnel.\n\u25e6A failure to maintain food safety throughout the supply chain and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.\n\u25e6Other risk factors may adversely affect our financial performance.\nRisk related to our common stock\n\u25e6We must continue to meet NASDAQ Global Market Continued Listing Requirements, or we risk delisting.\n\u25e6We may be subject to allegations, defamations, or other detrimental conduct by third parties, which could harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers and/or contribute to a deflation of our stock price.\n\u25e6Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to seasonality and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\n\u25e6Anti-takeover effects of the issuance of our preferred stock could adversely affect our common stock.\n\u25e6Future sales or the perception of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress our stock price.\n\u25e6Our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.\n\u25e6Cumulative voting is not available to our stockholders.\n\u25e6Our directors and officers have limited liability and have rights to indemnification.\nDetails of our risk factors are as follows:\nRisks related to general macroeconomic and safety conditions\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt our business, which has and could continue to materially affect our operations, financial condition and results of operations for an extended period of time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect that was material on our business. The COVID-19 pandemic, federal, state and local government responses to COVID-19, our customers responses to the pandemic, and our Companys responses to the pandemic have all disrupted and will continue to disrupt our business. In the United States, state and local governments imposed a variety of restrictions on people and businesses and public health authorities offered regular guidance on health and safety. Once COVID-19 vaccines were approved and moved into wider distribution in the United States in early 2021, public health conditions improved and almost all of the COVID-19 restrictions on businesses eased. During fiscal 2022, increases in the numbers of cases of COVID-19 throughout the United States including the Omicron variant which impacted our restaurants in the second quarter, mostly in January 2022, subjected some of our restaurants to other COVID-19-related restrictions such as mask and/or vaccine requirements for team members, guests or both. Exclusions and quarantines of restaurant team members or groups thereof disrupt an individual restaurants operations and often come with little or no notice to the local restaurant management. During fiscal 2022, along with COVID-19, our operating results were impacted by geopolitical and other macroeconomic events, leading to higher than usual inflation on wages and other cost of goods sold. These events further impacted the availability of team members needed to staff our restaurants and caused additional disruptions in our product supply chain.\nThe ongoing effects of COVID-19 and its variants, along with other geopolitical and macroeconomic events could lead to future capacity restrictions, mask and vaccination mandates, wage inflation, staffing challenges, product cost inflation and disruptions in the supply chain that impact our restaurants ability to obtain the products needed to support their operations.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\nThe ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine could have adverse effects on global macroeconomic conditions which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The conflict is highly unpredictable and has already resulted in significant volatility in oil and natural gas prices worldwide. We currently have some software developers in Ukraine and the uncertainly of their living conditions has delayed some of the deliverables in our recently\nlaunched internet venture. In addition, the conflict could lead to increased cyberattacks or could aggravate other risk factors that we have previously identified.\nIf we are unable to maintain compliance with certain of our debt covenants or unable to obtain waivers, we may be unable to make additional borrowings and be declared in default where our debt will be made immediately due and payable. In addition, global economic conditions may make it more difficult to access new credit facilities.\nOur liquidity position is, in part, dependent upon our ability to borrow funds from financial institutions and/or private individuals. Certain of our debts have financial covenants that require us to maintain certain operating income to debt service ratios. As of September 30, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants. Due to the impact of COVID-19 and other external factors such as supply chain disruption, the conflict in Ukraine and the potential economic slowdown, our financial performance in future fiscal quarters could be negatively impacted. A failure to comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility or obtain waivers would give rise to an event of default under the terms of certain of our debts, allowing the lenders to accelerate repayment of any outstanding debt.\nWe have recorded impairment charges in current and past periods and may record additional impairment charges in future periods.\nOur nightclubs are often acquired with a purchase price based on historical EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization). This results in certain nightclubs carrying a substantial amount of intangible asset value, mostly allocated to licenses and goodwill. Generally accepted accounting principles require periodic impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived assets, and goodwill to determine if, or when events and circumstances indicate that, the fair value of these assets is not recoverable. As a result of our periodic impairment reviews, we recorded impairment charges of $1.9 million in 2022 (representing $566,000 goodwill impairment on one club, $293,000 SOB license impairment on one club, and $1.0 million property and equipment impairment on one club and one Bombshells unit); $13.6 million in 2021 (representing $6.3 million goodwill impairment on seven clubs, $5.3 million SOB license impairment on three clubs, and $2.0 million property and equipment impairment on four clubs and one held-for-sale property); and $10.6 million in 2020 (representing $7.9 million goodwill impairment on seven club reporting units, $2.3 million of license impairment on two clubs, $302,000 property and equipment impairment on one club and one Bombshells, and $104,000 of operating lease right-of-use asset impairment on one club). A huge portion, if not all, of the impairments in 2021 and 2020 related to the projected decline in EBITDA caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. If difficult market and economic conditions materialize over the next year and/or we experience a decrease in revenue at one or more nightclubs or restaurants, we could incur a decline in fair value of one or more of our nightclubs or restaurants. This could result in future impairment charges of up to the total value of our tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill. We actively monitor our clubs and restaurants for any indication of impairment.\nRisks related to regulations and/or regulatory agencies\nOur business operations are subject to regulatory uncertainties which may affect our ability to continue operations of existing nightclubs, acquire additional nightclubs, or be profitable.\nAdult entertainment nightclubs are subject to local, state and federal regulations. Our business is regulated by local zoning, local and state liquor licensing, local ordinances, and state and federal time place and manner restrictions. The adult entertainment provided by our nightclubs has elements of speech and expression and, therefore, enjoys some protection under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, the protection is limited to the expression, and not the conduct of an entertainer. While our nightclubs are generally well established in their respective markets, there can be no assurance that local, state and/or federal licensing and other regulations will permit our nightclubs to remain in operation or profitable in the future.\nThe adult entertainment industry standard is to classify adult entertainers as independent contractors, not employees. If federal or state law mandates that they be classified as employees, our business could be adversely impacted.\nThe adult entertainment industry standard is to classify adult entertainers as independent contractors, not employees. The Internal Revenue Service regulations and applicable state law guidelines regarding independent contractor classification are subject to judicial and agency interpretation, and it could be determined that the independent contractor classification is inapplicable. Further, if legal standards for classification of independent contractors change, it may be necessary to modify our compensation structure for these adult entertainers, including by paying additional compensation or reimbursing expenses. While we take steps to ensure that our adult entertainers are deemed independent contractors, if our adult\nentertainers are determined to have been misclassified as independent contractors, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state law, workers compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings. Any of these outcomes could result in substantial costs to us, could significantly impair our financial condition and our ability to conduct our business as we choose, and could damage our ability to attract and retain other personnel.\nOur revenues could be significantly affected by limitations relating to permits to sell alcoholic beverages.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of alcoholic beverages. States in which we operate may have laws which may limit the availability of a permit to sell alcoholic beverages, or which may provide for suspension or revocation of a permit to sell alcoholic beverages in certain circumstances. The temporary or permanent suspension or revocations of any such permits would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition and results of operations. In all states where we operate, management believes we are in compliance with applicable city, county, state or other local laws governing the sale of alcohol.\nActivities or conduct at our nightclubs may cause us to lose necessary business licenses, expose us to liability, or result in adverse publicity, which may increase our costs and divert managements attention from our business.\nWe are subject to risks associated with activities or conduct at our nightclubs that are illegal or violate the terms of necessary business licenses. Some of our nightclubs operate under licenses for sexually oriented businesses and are afforded some protection under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. While we believe that the activities at our nightclubs comply with the terms of such licenses, and that the element of our business that constitutes an expression of free speech under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is protected, activities and conduct at our nightclubs may be found to violate the terms of such licenses or be unprotected under the U.S. Constitution. This protection is limited to the expression and not the conduct of an entertainer. An issuing authority may suspend or terminate a license for a nightclub found to have violated the license terms. Illegal activities or conduct at any of our nightclubs may result in negative publicity or litigation. Such consequences may increase our cost of doing business, divert managements attention from our business and make an investment in our securities unattractive to current and potential investors, thereby lowering our profitability and our stock price.\nWe have developed comprehensive policies aimed at ensuring that the operation of each of our nightclubs is conducted in conformance with local, state and federal laws. We have a no tolerance policy on illegal drug use in or around our facilities. We continually monitor the actions of entertainers, waitresses and customers to ensure that proper behavior standards are met. However, such policies, no matter how well designed and enforced, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the policies objectives are being achieved. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems and policies, there can be no assurance that our policies will prevent deliberate acts by persons attempting to violate or circumvent them. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations, management believes that our policies are reasonably effective in achieving their purposes.\nRisks related to our business\nWe may deviate from our present capital allocation strategy.\nWe believe that our present capital allocation strategy will provide us with optimized returns. However, implementation of our capital allocation strategy depends on the interplay of several factors such as our stock price, our outstanding common shares, the interest rates on our debt, and the rate of return on available investments. If these factors are not conducive to implementing our present capital allocation strategy, or we determine that adopting a different capital allocation strategy is in the best interest of shareholders, we reserve the right to deviate from this approach. There can be no assurance that we will not deviate from or adopt an alternative capital allocation strategy moving forward.\nWe may need additional financing, or our business expansion plans may be significantly limited.\nIf cash generated from our operations is insufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, we will need to raise additional funds through the public or private sale of our equity or debt securities. The timing and amount of our capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including cash flow and cash requirements for nightclub acquisitions and new restaurant development. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentage of our then-existing shareholders will be diluted. We cannot ensure that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. Any future equity financing, if available, may result\nin dilution to existing shareholders; and debt financing, if available, may include restrictive covenants. Any failure by us to procure timely additional financing, if needed, will have material adverse consequences on our business operations.\nThere is substantial competition in the nightclub entertainment industry, which may affect our ability to operate profitably or acquire additional clubs.\nOur nightclubs face substantial competition. Some of our competitors may have greater financial and management resources than we do. Additionally, the industry is subject to unpredictable competitive trends and competition for general entertainment dollars. There can be no assurance that we will be able to remain profitable in this competitive industry.\nThe adult entertainment industry is extremely volatile.\nHistorically, the adult entertainment, restaurant and bar industry has been an extremely volatile industry. The industry tends to be extremely sensitive to the general local economy, in that when economic conditions are prosperous, adult entertainment industry revenues increase, and when economic conditions are unfavorable, entertainment industry revenues decline. Coupled with this economic sensitivity are the trendy personal preferences of the customers who frequent adult nightclubs. We continuously monitor trends in our customers tastes and entertainment preferences so that, if necessary, we can make appropriate changes which will allow us to remain one of the premiere adult nightclubs. However, any significant decline in general corporate conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we have historically catered to a clientele base from the upper end of the market. Accordingly, further reductions in the amounts of entertainment expenses allowed as deductions from income under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, could adversely affect sales to customers dependent upon corporate expense accounts.\nPrivate advocacy group actions targeted at the kind of adult entertainment we offer could result in limitations in our inability to operate in certain locations and negatively impact our business.\nOur ability to operate successfully depends on the protection provided to us under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. From time to time, private advocacy groups have sought to target our nightclubs by petitioning for non-renewal of certain of our permits and licenses. Furthermore, private advocacy groups which have influences on certain financial institutions have managed to sway these financial institutions into not doing business with us. In addition to possibly limiting our operations and financing options, negative publicity campaigns, lawsuits and boycotts could negatively affect our businesses and cause additional financial harm by discouraging investors from investing in our securities or requiring that we incur significant expenditures to defend our business.\nWe rely heavily on information technology in our operations and any material failure, weakness, interruption, or breach of security could prevent us from effectively operating our business.\nOur operations and corporate functions rely heavily on information systems, including point-of-sale processing, management of our supply chain, payment of obligations, collection of cash, electronic communications, data warehousing to support analytics, finance and accounting systems, mobile technologies to enhance the customer experience, and other various processes and procedures, some of which are handled by third parties. Our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, maintenance problems, upgrading or transitioning to new platforms, or a breach in security relating to these systems could result in delays in consumer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. These problems could adversely affect our results of operations, and remediation could result in significant, unplanned capital investments.\nSecurity breaches of confidential customer information or personal employee information may adversely affect our business.\nA significant portion of our revenues are paid through debit and credit cards. Other restaurants and retailers have experienced significant security breaches in which debit and credit card information or other personal information of their customers have been stolen. We also maintain certain personal information regarding our employees. Although we aim to safeguard our technology systems, they could potentially be vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to physical theft, fire, power outage, telecommunication failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, employee error or malfeasance, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers and cyber criminals. A breach in our systems that compromises the information of our customers or employees could result in widespread negative publicity, damage to our reputation, a loss of customers, and legal liabilities.\nWe may in the future become subject to lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising from the actual or alleged theft of our customers debit and credit card information or if customer or employee information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately. Any such claim or proceeding, or any adverse publicity resulting from such an event, may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur acquisitions may result in disruptions in our business and diversion of managements attention.\nWe have made and may continue to make acquisitions of complementary nightclubs, restaurants or related operations. Any acquisitions will require the integration of the operations, products and personnel of the acquired businesses and the training and motivation of these individuals. Such acquisitions may disrupt our operations and divert managements attention from day-to-day operations, which could impair our relationships with current employees, customers and partners. We may also incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions. These issuances could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders. In addition, our profitability may suffer because of acquisition-related costs or amortization, or impairment costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. If management is unable to fully integrate acquired business, products or persons with existing operations, we may not receive the benefits of the acquisitions, and our revenues and stock trading price may decrease.\nWe face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees and licensees.\nWe have started franchising Bombshells. We believe that we have selected highly competent operating partners and franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations, and we are providing them training and support on the Bombshells brand. However, the probability of opening, ultimate success and quality of any franchise or licensed restaurant rests principally with the franchisee. If the franchisee does not successfully open and operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards, or if guests have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution, our brand value could suffer, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe impact of new club or restaurant openings could result in fluctuations in our financial performance.\nPerformance of any new club or restaurant location will usually differ from its originally targeted performance due to a variety of factors, and these differences may be material. New clubs and restaurants typically encounter higher customer traffic and sales in their initial months, which may decrease over time. Accordingly, sales achieved by new or reconcepted locations may not be indicative of future operating results. Additionally, we incur substantial pre-opening expenses each time we open a new establishment, which expenses may be higher than anticipated. Due to the foregoing factors, results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year.\nOur ability to grow sales through delivery orders is uncertain.\nPart of our strategy for restaurant growth is dependent on increased sales from guests that want our food delivered to them. We currently rely on third-party delivery providers for the ordering and payment platforms that receive guest orders and that send orders directly to our point-of-sale system. These platforms could be damaged or interrupted by technological failures, cyber-attacks, or other factors, which may adversely impact our sales through these channels.\nDelivery providers generally fulfill delivery orders through drivers that are independent contractors. These drivers may make errors, fail to make timely deliveries, damage our food, or poorly represent our brands, which may lead to customer disappointment, reputational harm and unmet sales expectations. Our sales may also be adversely impacted if there is a shortage of drivers that are willing and available to make deliveries from our restaurants. We also incur additional costs associated with delivery orders, and it is possible that these orders could cannibalize more profitable in-restaurant visits or take-out orders.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management devotes substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that our non-public competition does not incur. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring certain corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and\nregulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nIn addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In performing this evaluation and testing, both our management and our independent registered public accounting firm concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as of September 30, 2022. We are, however, addressing this issue and remediating our material weakness. When we were to identify a material weakness, correcting that issue, and thereafter our continued compliance with Section 404 require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. Moreover, if we are not able to correct an internal control issue and comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if in the future we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, and concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, management identified a material weakness related to management's review of accounting for business combinations, specifically related to the identification of and accounting for, intangibles assets acquired in a business combination - see Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, below. While certain actions have been taken to implement a remediation plan to address this material weakness and to enhance our internal control over financial reporting, if this material weakness is not remediated, it could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, which could negatively affect investor confidence in our company, and, as a result, the value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe may have uninsured risks in excess of our insurance coverage.\nWe maintain insurance in amounts we consider adequate for personal injury and property damage to which the business of the Company may be subject. However, there can be no assurance that uninsured liabilities in excess of the coverage provided by insurance, which liabilities may be imposed pursuant to the Texas dram shop statute or similar dram shop statutes or common law theories of liability in other states where we operate or expand. For example, the Texas dram shop statute provides a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to such person if it was apparent to the server that the individual being sold, served or provided with an alcoholic beverage was obviously intoxicated to the extent that he presented a clear danger to himself and others. An employer is not liable for the actions of its employee who over-serves if (i) the employer requires its employees to attend a seller training program approved by the TABC; (ii) the employee has actually attended such a training program; and (iii) the employer has not directly or indirectly encouraged the employee to violate the law. It is our policy to require that all servers of alcohol working at our clubs in Texas be certified as servers under a training program approved by the TABC, which certification gives statutory immunity to the sellers of alcohol from damage caused to third parties by those who have consumed alcoholic beverages at such establishment pursuant to the TABC. There can be no assurance, however, that uninsured liabilities may not arise in the markets in which we operate which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nOur previous liability insurer may be unable to provide coverage to us and our subsidiaries.\nAs previously reported, the Company and its subsidiaries were insured under a liability policy issued by Indemnity Insurance Corporation, RRG (IIC) through October 25, 2013. The Company and its subsidiaries changed insurance companies on that date.\nOn November 7, 2013, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware entered a Rehabilitation and Injunction Order (Rehabilitation Order), which declared IIC impaired, insolvent and in an unsafe condition and placed IIC under the supervision of the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Delaware (Commissioner) in her capacity as receiver (Receiver). The Rehabilitation Order empowered the Commissioner to rehabilitate IIC through a variety of means,\nincluding gathering assets and marshaling those assets, as necessary. Further, the order stayed or abated pending lawsuits involving IIC as the insurer until May 6, 2014.\nOn April 10, 2014, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware entered a Liquidation and Injunction Order With Bar Date (Liquidation Order), which ordered the liquidation of IIC and terminated all insurance policies or contracts of insurance issued by IIC. The Liquidation Order further ordered that all claims against IIC must have been filed with the Receiver before the close of business on January 16, 2015 and that all pending lawsuits involving IIC as the insurer were further stayed or abated until October 7, 2014. As a result, the Company and its subsidiaries no longer had insurance coverage under the liability policy with IIC. The Company has retained counsel to defend against and evaluate these claims and lawsuits. We are funding 100% of the costs of litigation and will seek reimbursement from the bankruptcy receiver. The Company filed the appropriate claims against IIC with the Receiver before the January 16, 2015 deadline and has provided updates as requested; however, there are no assurances of any recovery from these claims. It is unknown at this time what effect this uncertainty will have on the Company. As previously stated, since October 25, 2013, the Company obtained general liability coverage from other insurers, which have covered and/or will cover any claims arising from actions after that date. As of September 30, 2022, we have 1 remaining unresolved claims out of the original 71 claims.\nThe protection provided by our service marks is limited.\nOur rights to the trade names RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc., Ricks, Ricks Cabaret, Tootsies Cabaret, Club Onyx, XTC Cabaret, Temptations, Jaguars, Downtown Cabaret, Cabaret East, Bombshells Restaurant and Bar, Vee Lounge, Mile High Mens Club, Country Rock Cabaret, PTs, and Diamond Cabaret are established under common law, based upon our substantial and continuous use of these trade names in interstate commerce, some of which have been in use at least as early as 1987. We have registered our service mark, RICKS AND STARS DESIGN, and the BOMBSHELLS RESTAURANT & BAR logo design with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have also obtained service mark registrations from the Patent and Trademark Office for RICKS AND STARS DESIGN logo, RCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC., RICKS, RICKS CABARET, CLUB ONYX, XTC CABARET, SCARLETTS CABARET, SILVER CITY CABARET, BOMBSHELLS RESTAURANT AND BAR, THE SEVILLE CLUB, DOWN IN TEXAS SALOON, CLUB DULCE, THE BLACK ORCHID, HOOPS CABARET, VEE LOUNGE, STUDIO 80, FOXYS CABARET, EXOTIC DANCER, TOYS FOR TATAS, MILE HIGH MENS CLUB, MHMC logo, AFTER DARK, COUNTRY ROCK CABARET, PTS, DIAMOND CABARET, and BOMBSHELLS OFFICERS CLUB are registered through service mark registrations issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. As of this date, we have pending registration applications for the names TOOTSIES CABARET, IN THE BIZ, JAGUARS, THE MANSION, and LA BOHEME GENTLEMANS CLUB. We also own the rights to numerous trade names associated with our media division. There can be no assurance that these steps we have taken to protect our service marks will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our protected intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to protect our rights from infringement, which may be costly and time consuming. The loss of the intellectual property rights owned or claimed by us could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent on key personnel.\nOur future success is dependent, in a large part, on retaining the services of Eric Langan, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bradley Chhay, our Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Langan possesses a unique and comprehensive knowledge of our industry. While Mr. Langan has no present plans to leave or retire in the near future, his loss could have a negative effect on our operating, marketing and financial performance if we are unable to find an adequate replacement with similar knowledge and experience within our industry. Mr. Chhay possesses thorough familiarity with our accounting system and how it affects our operations. Mr. Chhay is also vital in our due diligence efforts when acquiring clubs. We maintain key-man life insurance with respect to Mr. Langan but not for Mr. Chhay. Although Messrs. Langan and Chhay have signed employment agreements with us (as described herein), there can be no assurance that Mr. Langan or Mr. Chhay will continue to be employed by us.\nA failure to maintain food safety throughout the supply chain and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.\nFood safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe, quality food products. However, food safety issues could be caused at the point of source or by food suppliers or distributors and, as a result, be out of our control. In addition, regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses such as E. coli, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella, and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination, at one\nof our restaurants or clubs could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.\nOther risk factors may adversely affect our financial performance.\nOther risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements by affecting, among many things, pricing, consumer spending and consumer confidence, include, without limitation, changes in economic conditions and financial and credit markets, credit availability, increased fuel costs and availability for our employees, customers and suppliers, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospects of these events (such as reports on avian flu or COVID-19), consumer perceptions of food safety, changes in consumer tastes and behaviors, governmental monetary policies, changes in demographic trends, terrorist acts, energy shortages and rolling blackouts, and weather (including, major hurricanes and regional snow storms) and other acts of God.\nWe are also subject to the general risks of inflation, increases in minimum wage, health care, and other benefits that may have a material adverse effect on our cost structure, and the disruption in our supply chain caused by several factor, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisk related to our common stock\nWe must continue to meet NASDAQ Global Market Continued Listing Requirements, or we risk delisting.\nOur securities are currently listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market. We must continue to satisfy NASDAQs continued listing requirements or risk delisting which would have an adverse effect on our business. If our securities are ever delisted from NASDAQ, they may trade on the over-the-counter market, which may be a less liquid market. In such case, our shareholders ability to trade or obtain quotations of the market value of shares of our common stock would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities.\nWe may be subject to allegations, defamations, or other detrimental conduct by third parties, which could harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers and/or contribute to a deflation of our stock price.\nWe have been subject to allegations by third parties or purported former employees, negative internet postings, and other adverse public exposure on our business, operations and staff compensation. We may also become the target of defamations or other detrimental conduct by third parties or disgruntled former or current employees. Such conduct may include complaints, anonymous or otherwise, to regulatory agencies, media or other organizations. We may be subject to government or regulatory investigation or other proceedings as a result of such third-party conduct and may be required to spend significant time and incur substantial costs to address such third-party conduct, and there is no assurance that we will be able to conclusively refute each of the allegations within a reasonable period of time, or at all. Any government or regulatory investigations initiated as a result of the above may cause a deflation in our stock price. Additionally, allegations, directly or indirectly against us, may be posted on the internet, including social media platforms by anyone, whether or not related to us, on an anonymous basis. Any negative publicity on us or our management can be quickly and widely disseminated. Social media platforms and devices immediately publish the content of their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. Information posted may be inaccurate and adverse to us, and it may harm our reputation, business or prospects. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Our reputation may be negatively affected as a result of the public dissemination of negative and potentially false information about our business and operations, which in turn may cause us to lose customers.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to seasonality and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nOur nightclub operations are affected by seasonal factors. Historically, we have experienced reduced revenues from April through September with the strongest operating results occurring from October through March. As a result, our quarterly and annual operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality and the factors discussed above. Accordingly, results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be\nexpected for any other fiscal quarter or for any fiscal year and same-store sales for any particular future period may decrease. In the future, operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the price of our common stock would likely decrease.\nAnti-takeover effects of the issuance of our preferred stock could adversely affect our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to fix the number of shares constituting any such series, and to fix the rights and preferences of the shares constituting any series, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock by the Board of Directors could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock. For example, such issuance could result in a class of securities outstanding that would have preferences with respect to voting rights and dividends and in liquidation over the common stock, and could (upon conversion or otherwise) enjoy all of the rights appurtenant to common stock. The Boards authority to issue preferred stock could discourage potential takeover attempts and could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company through merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise by making such attempts more difficult to achieve or costlier. There are no issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock; there are no agreements or understandings for the issuance of preferred stock; and the Board of Directors has no present intention to issue preferred stock.\nFuture sales or the perception of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or as a result of the perception that these sales could occur. In addition, these factors could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock.\nOur stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.\nThe trading price of our securities may fluctuate significantly. This price may be influenced by many factors, including:\nour performance and prospects;\nthe depth and liquidity of the market for our securities;\ninvestor perception of us and the industry in which we operate;\nchanges in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts;\ngeneral financial and other market conditions; and\ndomestic economic conditions.\nPublic stock markets have experienced, and may experience, extreme price and trading volume volatility. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nCumulative voting is not available to our stockholders.\nCumulative voting in the election of Directors is expressly denied in our Articles of Incorporation. Accordingly, the holder or holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock may elect all of our Directors.\nOur directors and officers have limited liability and have rights to indemnification.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws provide, as permitted by governing Texas law, that our directors and officers shall not be personally liable to us or any of our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer, with certain exceptions. The Articles further provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers against expenses and liabilities they incur to defend, settle, or satisfy any civil litigation or criminal action brought against them on account of their being or having been its directors or officers unless, in such action, they are adjudged to have acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct.\nThe inclusion of these provisions in the Articles may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breach of their duty of care, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited us and our stockholders.\nThe Articles provide for the indemnification of our officers and directors, and the advancement to them of expenses in connection with any proceedings and claims, to the fullest extent permitted by Texas law. The Articles include related provisions meant to facilitate the indemnitees receipt of such benefits. These provisions cover, among other things: (i) specification of the method of determining entitlement to indemnification and the selection of independent counsel that will in some cases make such determination, (ii) specification of certain time periods by which certain payments or determinations must be made and actions must be taken, and (iii) the establishment of certain presumptions in favor of an indemnitee.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone. Item 2. Properties.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we own 66 real estate properties. On 49 of these properties, we operate clubs or restaurants, including those temporarily closed. We lease multiple other properties to third-party tenants. Five of our owned properties are in locations where we previously operated clubs, but now lease the buildings to third parties. Twelve are non-income-producing properties for corporate use (including our corporate office) or future club or restaurant locations, or may be offered for sale in the future. Fourteen of our clubs and restaurants are in leased locations.\nOur principal corporate office is located at 10737 Cutten Road, Houston, Texas 77066, consisting of a 21,000-square foot corporate office and an 18,000-square foot warehouse facility.\nBelow is a list of locations we operated as of September 30, 2022:\nName of Establishment Fiscal Year Acquired/Opened\nClub Onyx, Houston, TX 1995\nRicks Cabaret, Minneapolis, MN 1998\nXTC Cabaret, Austin, TX 1998\nScarlett's Cabaret, San Antonio, TX 1998\nRicks Cabaret, New York City, NY 2005\nClub Onyx, Charlotte, NC 2005 (1)\nJaguars Club, San Antonio, TX 2006\nRicks Cabaret, Fort Worth, TX 2007\nTootsies Cabaret, Miami Gardens, FL 2008\nXTC Cabaret, Dallas, TX 2008\nRicks Cabaret, Round Rock, TX 2009\nCabaret East, Fort Worth, TX 2010\nRicks Cabaret DFW, Fort Worth, TX 2011\nDowntown Cabaret, Minneapolis, MN 2011\nTemptations, Aledo, TX 2011 (1)\nSilver City Cabaret, Dallas, TX 2012\nJaguars Club, Odessa, TX 2012\nJaguars Club, Phoenix, AZ 2012\nJaguars Club, Lubbock, TX 2012\nJaguars Club, Longview, TX 2012\nJaguars Club, Abilene, TX 2012\nJaguars Club, Edinburg, TX 2012\nJaguars Club, El Paso, TX 2012\nJaguars Club, Harlingen, TX 2012\nStudio 80, Fort Worth, TX 2013 (1)\nBombshells, Dallas, TX 2013\nScarlett's Cabaret, Sulphur, LA 2013\nTemptations, Beaumont, TX 2013\nVivid Cabaret, New York, NY 2014 (1)\nBombshells, Austin, TX 2014 (1)\nRicks Cabaret, Odessa, TX 2014\nBombshells, Spring, TX 2014 (1)\nBombshells Fuqua, Houston, TX 2014 (1)\nFoxys Cabaret, Austin TX 2015\nThe Seville, Minneapolis, MN 2015\nHoops Cabaret and Sports Bar, New York, NY 2016 (1)\nBombshells, Highway 290 Houston, TX 2017 (1)\nScarletts Cabaret, Washington Park, IL 2017\nScarletts Cabaret, Miami, FL 2017\nBombshells, Pearland, TX 2018\nKappa Mens Club, Kappa, IL 2018\nRicks Cabaret, Chicago, IL 2019\nRicks Cabaret, Pittsburgh, PA 2019\nBombshells I-10, Houston, TX 2019\nBombshells 249, Houston, TX 2019\nBombshells, Katy, TX 2020\nBombshells 59, Houston, TX 2020\nDiamond Cabaret, Denver, CO 2022 (1)\nScarlett's Cabaret, Denver, CO 2022\nPT's Showclub, Denver, CO 2022\nLa Boheme Gentlemen's Cabaret, Denver, CO 2022 (1)\nDiamond Cabaret, St. Louis, IL 2022 (1)\nCountry Rock Cabaret, St. Louis, IL 2022 (1)\nPT's Showclub, Indianapolis, IN 2022\nRick's Cabaret, Raleigh, NC 2022 (1)\nRick's Cabaret, Portland, ME 2022\nPT's Showclub, Louisville, KY 2022\nPT's Centerfold, Denver, CO 2022\nMansion Gentlemen's Club & Steakhouse, Newburgh, NY 2022\nBombshells, Arlington, TX 2022\nPlaymates Club, Miami, FL 2022\nCheetah Gentlemen's Club, Miami, FL 2022\nPT's Showclub, Odessa, TX 2022\n(1)Leased location.\nOur property leases are typically for a fixed rental rate with contingent rent for certain locations. The lease terms generally have initial terms of 10 to 20 years with renewal terms of 5 to 20 years. At September 30, 2022, certain of the properties we own were collateral for mortgage debt amounting to approximately $123.0 million. We believe that our existing facilities, both owned and leased, are in good condition and adequate and suitable for the conduct of our business.\nSee related information in Notes 6 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nSee the Legal Matters section within Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the requirements of this Item, which section is incorporated herein by reference. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nOur common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol RICK.\nHolders\nOn December 9, 2022, the closing stock price for our common stock as reported by NASDAQ was $83.63, and there were 131 stockholders of record of our common stock (excluding broker held shares in street name). Currently, we estimate that there are approximately 10,700 stockholders having beneficial ownership in street name.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Colonial Stock Transfer Company, Inc., 66 Exchange Place, 1st Floor, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111.\nDividend Policy\nPrior to 2016, we had not paid cash dividends on our common stock. Starting in March 2016, in conjunction with our share buyback program (see discussion below), our Board of Directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.03 per share, except for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020, and all four quarters of fiscal 2021 when we paid $0.04 per share. In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we increased our regular quarterly dividends to $0.05 per share.

The boards adoption of the 2022 Plan was approved by the shareholders during the annual stockholders' meeting on August 23, 2022. The 2022 Plan provides that the maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock underlying options that may be granted under the 2022 Plan is 300,000. The options granted under the 2022 Plan may be either incentive stock options or non-qualified options. The 2022 Plan is administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors. The\ncompensation committee has the exclusive power to select individuals to receive grants, to establish the terms of the options granted to each participant, provided that all options granted shall be granted at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the common stock covered by the option on the grant date, and to make all determinations necessary or advisable under the 2022 Plan. On February 9, 2022, the board of directors approved a grant of 50,000 stock options each to six members of management subject to the approval of the 2022 Plan.\nSee Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for details.\nStock Performance Graph\nThe following chart compares the five-year cumulative total stock performance of our common stock; the NASDAQ Composite Index (IXIC); the Russell 2000 Index (RUT); and the Dow Jones U.S. Restaurant & Bar Index (DJUSRU), our peer index. The graph assumes a hypothetical investment of $100 on September 30, 2017 in each of our common stock and each of the indices, and that all dividends were reinvested. The measurement points utilized in the graph consist of the last trading day as of September 30 each year, representing the last day of our fiscal year. The calculations exclude trading commissions and taxes. We have selected the Dow Jones U.S. Restaurant & Bar Index as our peer index since it represents a broader group of restaurant and bar operators that are more aligned to our core business operations. RICK is a component of the NASDAQ Composite Index and the Russell 2000 Index.

[Reserved] Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOVERVIEW\nThe following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc., our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. This overview summarizes the MD&A, which includes the following sections:\nOur Business - a general description of our business and the adult nightclub industry, our objective, our strategic priorities, our core capabilities, and challenges and risks of our business.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates - a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates.\nOperations Review - an analysis of our Companys consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources - an analysis of cash flows, aggregate contractual obligations, and an overview of financial position.\nCurrent Operating Environment\nOur fiscal 2020 was the period hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic causing a significant reduction in customer traffic in our clubs and restaurants due to changes in consumer behavior as social distancing practices, dining room closures and other restrictions were mandated or encouraged by federal, state and local governments. In fiscal 2021, our businesses started to recover from the initial effects of the pandemic when government restrictions eased. Stimulus money also flowed to the economy at that time which prompted discretionary spending. In fiscal 2022, several coronavirus variants threatened to bring back tight restrictions. Along with the pandemic, geopolitical and macroeconomic events started to affect the U.S. economy in general, with global inflation and supply chain disruptions impacting our businesses.\nGeopolitical and macroeconomic events are still developing. In the event global inflation leads to a major economic downturn, our business operations and cash flow could be significantly affected.\nOUR BUSINESS\nThe following are our operating segments:\nNightclubs Our wholly-owned subsidiaries own and/or operate upscale adult nightclubs serving primarily businessmen and professionals. These nightclubs are in Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth, Beaumont, Longview, Harlingen, Edinburg, Tye, Lubbock, Aledo, Round Rock, El Paso and Odessa, Texas; Denver, Colorado; Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina; Minneapolis, Minnesota; New York and Newburgh, New York; Miami Gardens, Pembroke Park and Miami, Florida; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Phoenix, Arizona; Louisville, Kentucky; Portland, Maine; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Washington Park, Kappa, Sauget and Chicago, Illinois. No sexual contact is permitted at any of our locations. We also own and operate a Studio 80 dance club in Fort Worth, Texas. We also own and lease to third parties real properties that are adjacent to (or used to be locations of) our clubs.\nBombshells Our wholly-owned subsidiaries own and operate restaurants and sports bars in Houston, Dallas, Austin, Spring, Pearland, Tomball, Katy and Arlington, Texas under the brand name Bombshells Restaurant & Bar. We have one franchised unit in San Antonio, Texas.\nOther Our wholly-owned subsidiaries own a media division (Media Group), including the leading trade magazine serving the multibillion-dollar adult nightclubs industry and the adult retail products industry. We also own an industry trade show, an industry trade publication and more than a dozen industry and social media websites. Included here is Drink Robust, which is licensed to sell Robust Energy Drink in the United States.\nWe generate our revenues from the sale of liquor, beer, wine, food, and merchandise; service revenues such as cover charges, membership fees, and facility use fees; and other revenues such as commissions from vending and ATM machines, real estate rental, valet parking, and other products and services for both nightclub and restaurant/sports bar operations. Other revenues include Media Group revenues for the sale of advertising content and revenues from our annual Expo convention, and Drink Robust sales. Our fiscal year-end is September 30.\nSame-Store Sales. We calculate same-store sales by comparing year-over-year revenues from nightclubs and restaurants/sports bars starting in the first full quarter of operations after at least 12 full months for Nightclubs and at least 18 full months for Bombshells. We consider the first six months of operations of a Bombshells unit to be the honeymoon period where sales are significantly higher than normal. We exclude from a particular months calculation units previously included in the same-store sales base that have closed temporarily for more than 15 days until its next full quarter of operations. We also exclude from the same-store sales base units that are being reconcepted or are closed due to renovations or remodels. Acquired units are included in the same-store sales calculation as long as they qualify based on the definitions stated above. Revenues outside of our Nightclubs and Bombshells reportable segments core business are excluded from same-store sales calculation.\nOur goal is to use our Companys assets-our brands, financial strength, and the talent and strong commitment of our management and employees-to become more competitive and to accelerate growth.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nManagements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on managements historical and industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On a regular basis, we evaluate these accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from our estimates, and such differences could be material.\nA full discussion of our significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, which is included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results. These estimates require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments because they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our Audit Committee.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining useful life of the primary asset included in the asset group. If the asset group is not recoverable, the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. We define our asset group as an operating club or restaurant location, which is also our reporting unit or the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified. Key estimates in the undiscounted cash flow model include managements estimate of the projected revenues and operating margins. If fair value is used to determine an impairment loss, an additional key assumption is the selection of a weighted-average cost of capital to discount cash flows. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. During the third quarter of 2022, we impaired two properties for a total of $1.0 million one due to eminent domain by the state of Texas and the other due to underperformance. During the second quarter of 2021, we impaired one property that was reclassified to assets held for sale for $1.4 million, and during the fourth quarter of 2021, we impaired four clubs for $584,000. During the second quarter of 2020, we impaired one club and one Bombshells unit for a total of $302,000, and during the third quarter of 2020, we impaired one club for its operating lease right-of-use asset for $104,000.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment during our fourth fiscal quarter and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.\nOur impairment calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate fair values. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to impairments that could be material. We do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a change in the estimates or assumptions we used that could cause a material change in our calculated impairment charges.\nFor our goodwill impairment review, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. This assessment is based on several factors, including industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, including an assessment of cash flows in comparison to actual and projected results of prior periods. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value based on our qualitative analysis, or if we elect to skip this step, we perform a Step 1 quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value is determined using market-related valuation models, including discounted cash flows and comparable asset market values. Key estimates in the discounted cash flow model include managements estimate of the projected revenues and operating margins, along with the selection of a weighted-average cost of capital to discount cash flows. We recognize goodwill impairment in the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit, based on the results of our Step 1 analysis. For the year ended September 30, 2022, we identified one reporting unit that was impaired and recognized a goodwill impairment loss of $566,000. For the year ended September 30, 2021, we identified seven reporting units that were impaired and recognized a goodwill impairment loss totaling $6.3 million. For the year ended September 30, 2020, we identified seven reporting units that were impaired and recognized a goodwill impairment loss totaling $7.9 million.\nFor indefinite-lived intangibles, specifically SOB licenses, we determine fair value by estimating the multiperiod excess earnings of the asset with key assumptions being similar to those used in the goodwill impairment valuation model. For indefinite-lived tradename, we determine fair value by using the relief from royalty method. The fair value is then compared to the carrying value and an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount\nexceeds the fair value of the asset. We recorded impairment charges for SOB licenses amounting to $293,000 in 2022 related to one club, $5.3 million in 2021 related to three clubs, and $2.3 million in 2020 related to two clubs.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the recognition of acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the acquisition price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Results of operations related to acquired entities are included prospectively beginning with the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe recognize expense for stock-based compensation awards, which is equal to the fair value of the awards at grant date, ratably in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations over their requisite service period. Calculating the grant date fair value of stock-based compensation awards requires the input of subjective assumptions. We determine the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with assumptions based primarily on historical data. Specific inputs to the model include the expected term of the stock options, stock price volatility, dividend yield, and risk-free interest rate.\nWe used our historical exercise and post-vesting expiration behavior of grantees on stock options awarded prior to the 2022 Plan which may not be reflective of current stock market environment and current mix of grantees. We estimated expected volatility based on historical volatility of the Company's stock price for a period equal to the award's expected term. We estimated expected dividend yield based on the current dividend payout activity and the exercise price (that is, the expected dividends that would likely be reflected in an amount at which the stock option would be exchanged). The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. We recognize forfeitures when they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nWe estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes including the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and book carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. These estimates include depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes, allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on employee tip income, effective rates for state and local income taxes, and the deductibility of certain other items, among others. We adjust our annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available. When necessary, we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to a balance that is more likely than not to be realized.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nAs mentioned in Item 3 - Legal Proceedings and in a more detailed discussion in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various suits and claims in the normal course of business. We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility that we may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations, the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In matters where there is insurance coverage, in the event we incur any liability, we believe it is unlikely we would incur losses in connection with these claims in excess of our insurance coverage.\nOPERATIONS REVIEW\nHighlights of operations from fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 are as follows (in thousands, except percentages and per share amounts):\n2022 Inc (Dec) 2021 Inc (Dec) 2020\nRevenues\nConsolidated $ 267,620 37.1 % $ 195,258 47.6 % $ 132,327\nNightclubs $ 206,251 50.2 % $ 137,348 55.4 % $ 88,373\nBombshells $ 59,925 5.8 % $ 56,621 31.0 % $ 43,215\nSame-store sales\nConsolidated +5.6 % +1.5 %\nNightclubs +10.1 % -2.1 %\nBombshells -4.6 % +7.7 %\nIncome from operations\nConsolidated $ 71,459 85.4 % $ 38,548 1,303.8 % $ 2,746\nNightclubs $ 82,798 89.0 % $ 43,815 235.6 % $ 13,056\nBombshells $ 11,504 (13.3) % $ 13,264 43.6 % $ 9,237\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share $ 4.91 $ 3.37 $ (0.66)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 64,509 53.6 % $ 41,991 168.6 % $ 15,632\nFree cash flow* $ 58,911 63.3 % $ 36,084 167.7 % $ 13,481\n*Reconciliation and discussion of non-GAAP financial measures are included under the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this Item.

A breakdown of the changes compared to total changes in Bombshells revenues is as follows:\n2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020\nImpact of 4.6% decrease and 7.7% increase in same-store sales, respectively, to total revenues (4.6) % 5.2 %\nNew units 10.1 % 9.6 %\nClosed units - % 16.2 %\nOther 0.3 % - %\n5.8 % 31.0 %\nBombshells segment sales mix for the three fiscal years is as follows:\n2022 2021 2020\nSales of alcoholic beverages 55.6 % 57.2 % 62.8 %\nSales of food and merchandise 43.4 % 42.2 % 36.8 %\nService and other revenues 1.0 % 0.6 % 0.4 %\n100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nBombshells Katy was opened in the first quarter of 2020, while Bombshells 59 was opened in the second quarter of 2020. No new Bombshells location was opened in 2021. Bombshells Arlington was opened in the first quarter of 2022.\nOther segment revenues. Other revenues included revenues from Drink Robust in all three fiscal years presented. Drink Robust sales were $201,000, $249,000, and $150,000 in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, which excludes intercompany sales to Nightclubs and Bombshells units amounting to $261,000, $141,000, and $70,000 in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Media business revenues were $1.2 million, $1.0 million, and $589,000 in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 ED EXPO that was supposed to be held in August 2020 (fiscal 2020) was canceled. All unearned sponsorship and advertising revenues related to the event were either further deferred or refunded and no revenue was recognized.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses, as a percent of consolidated revenues, were 73.3%, 80.3%, and 97.9% for the fiscal year 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Significant contributors to the change in operating expenses as a percent of revenues are explained below.\nCost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold includes cost of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, food, cigars and cigarettes, merchandise, media printing/binding, and Drink Robust. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, consolidated cost of goods sold was 13.5%, 15.4%, and 14.7% for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. See page 29 above for the breakdown of percentages for each line item of consolidated cost of goods sold as it relates to the respective consolidated revenue line. For the Nightclubs segment, cost of goods sold was 10.5%, 11.8%, and 10.7% for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, which was primarily caused by shifts in sales mix. Bombshells cost of goods sold was 23.5%, 23.8%, and 22.6% for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, which was mainly driven by menu price increases in 2022 in response to inflation, the shift in sales mix to lower-margin food sales in 2021, and to higher-margin alcoholic beverage sales in 2020.\nSalaries and wages. Consolidated salaries and wages increased by $17.8 million, or 35.2%, from 2021 to 2022 and increased by $11.6 million, or 29.6%, from 2020 to 2021. The dollar decrease from 2020 to 2021 was mainly from personnel hiring and rehiring after easing restrictions from COVID-19, and the dollar increase from 2021 to 2022 was mainly from new employees caused by the fifteen new club acquisitions and one Bombshells opening. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated salaries and wages were 25.6%, 25.9%, and 29.5% in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, mainly due to sales trend and the impact of fixed salaries on increasing sales. Corporate salary pay cuts made in 2020 during the height of the pandemic restrictions were paid back in 2021.\nBy reportable segment, salaries and wages are broken down as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\n2022 Inc (Dec) 2021 Inc (Dec) 2020\nNightclubs $ 40,859 51.4 % $ 26,986 37.8 % $ 19,590\nBombshells 14,585 11.8 % 13,041 25.1 % 10,427\nOther 601 3.3 % 582 18.5 % 491\nCorporate 12,402 23.8 % 10,018 17.0 % 8,562\n$ 68,447 35.2 % $ 50,627 29.6 % $ 39,070\nUnit-level manager payroll is included in salaries and wages of each location, while payroll for regional manager and above are included in general corporate.\nSalaries and wages as a percentage of segment revenue (except Corporate, which is based on consolidated revenues):\n2022 2021 2020\nNightclubs 19.8 % 19.6 % 22.2 %\nBombshells 24.3 % 23.0 % 24.1 %\nOther 41.6 % 45.2 % 66.4 %\nCorporate 4.6 % 5.1 % 6.5 %\n25.6 % 25.9 % 29.5 %\nSelling, general and administrative expenses.

Conversely, due to the increase in revenues in 2021 from 2020, almost all selling, general and administrative expenses consequently increased except accounting and professional fees, insurance, leases, and legal. Accounting and legal fees primarily decreased from prior years SEC matters; lease expense decreased due to lease credits we received from certain landlords; while insurance decreased due to credits given by insurers for unused coverage due to COVID-19 closures in 2020. Most of the selling, general and administrative expense increases in 2022 came from the Nightclub acquisitions we made. We also incurred stock-based compensation expense from a new 2022 Stock Option Plan.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased by $4.2 million, or 50.4%, from 2021 to 2022 and decreased by $598,000, or 6.8%, from 2020 to 2021. The decrease from 2020 to 2021 was mainly from significantly low capital expenditure in 2020 while the increase from 2021 to 2022 was mainly caused by the growth in our depreciable asset base and amortizable intangibles caused by acquired clubs and a new Bombshells unit.\nOther charges, net. The components of other charges, net are in the table below (dollars in thousands):\n2022 Inc (Dec) 2021 Inc (Dec) 2020\nImpairment of assets $ 1,888 (86.1) % $ 13,612 28.2 % $ 10,615\nSettlement of lawsuits 1,417 5.0 % 1,349 675.3 % 174\nGain on sale of businesses and assets (2,375) 355.0 % (522) (21.0) % (661)\nLoss (gain) on insurance (463) (63.0) % (1,253) (398.3) % 420\n$ 467 (96.5) % $ 13,186 25.0 % $ 10,548\nThe significant variances in other charges, net are discussed below:\nDuring 2022, we recorded aggregate impairment charges amounting to $1.9 million related to goodwill of one club ($566,000), SOB license of one club ($293,000), and property and equipment of one club and one Bombshells unit ($1.0 million). During 2021, we recorded aggregate impairment charges amounting to $13.6 million related to goodwill of seven clubs ($6.3 million), SOB licenses of three clubs ($5.3 million), and property and equipment of five clubs, one of which is held for sale ($2.0 million). During 2020, we recorded aggregate impairment charges amounting to $10.6 million related to goodwill of seven clubs ($7.9 million), SOB licenses of two clubs ($2.3 million), and $406,000 of long-lived assets of one\nclub and one Bombshells restaurant (including impairment on operating lease right-of-use assets of $104,000). See Notes 2 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2021, we settled a case with one of our Bombshells landlords for $1.0 million. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. In 2022, we settled several cases including the image infringement lawsuit and the securities class actions part of which was paid by insurance.\nRefer to dispositions in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statement for details on gains or losses on sale of businesses and assets.\nIn relation to insurance claims and recoveries, we recognized a $463,000 gain in 2022, $1.3 million gain in 2021, and a $420,000 loss in 2020 mainly related to a fire in one of our clubs in Washington Park, Illinois toward the end of fiscal 2018 and a hurricane that damaged one of our clubs in Sulphur, Louisiana in August 2020. The rest of the claims for the Sulphur club were received in 2022. Gains related to insurance recoveries are recognized when the contingencies related to the insurance claims have been resolved, which may be in a subsequent reporting period. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome from Operations\nDuring fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, our consolidated operating margin was 26.7%, 19.7%, and 2.1%, respectively.\nBelow is a table which reflects segment contribution to income from operations (in thousands):\n2022 2021 2020\nNightclubs $ 82,798 $ 43,815 $ 13,056\nBombshells 11,504 13,264 9,237\nOther 57 35 (614)\nCorporate (22,900) (18,566) (18,933)\n$ 71,459 $ 38,548 $ 2,746\nNightclubs operating margin was 40.1%, 31.9%, and 14.8% in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the closure of underperforming units, fixed expense leverage on increasing sales, and impairment of assets of $1.2 million, $13.6 million, and $10.4 million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Bombshells operating margin was 19.2%, 23.4%, and 21.4% in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, mainly due to one new unit and same-store sales decrease in 2022, two new units and same-store sales increase in 2021, partially offset by COVID-19 impact in 2020.\nExcluding certain items, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP operating margin are computed in the tables below (dollars in thousands). Refer to discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 37.\nNightclubs Bombshells Other Corporate Total\nIncome (loss) from operations $ 82,798 $ 11,504 $ 57 $ (22,900) $ 71,459\nAmortization of intangibles 2,042 6 61 9 2,118\nSettlement of lawsuits 1,287 18 - 112 1,417\nImpairment of assets 1,238 650 - - 1,888\nLoss (gain) on sale of businesses and assets (2,010) 17 - (382) (2,375)\nGain on insurance (463) - - - (463)\nStock-based compensation - - - 2,353 2,353\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss) $ 84,892 $ 12,195 $ 118 $ (20,808) $ 76,397\nGAAP operating margin 40.1 % 19.2 % 3.9 % (8.6) % 26.7 %\nNon-GAAP operating margin 41.2 % 20.4 % 8.2 % (7.8) % 28.5 %\nNightclubs Bombshells Other Corporate Total\nIncome (loss) from operations $ 43,815 $ 13,264 $ 35 $ (18,566) $ 38,548\nAmortization of intangibles 187 14 57 - 258\nSettlement of lawsuits 275 59 5 1,010 1,349\nImpairment of assets 13,612 - - - 13,612\nCosts and charges related to debt refinancing 17 - - 40 57\nLoss (gain) on sale of businesses and assets (580) 72 - (14) (522)\nGain on insurance (1,209) - - (44) (1,253)\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss) $ 56,117 $ 13,409 $ 97 $ (17,574) $ 52,049\nGAAP operating margin 31.9 % 23.4 % 2.7 % (9.5) % 19.7 %\nNon-GAAP operating margin 40.9 % 23.7 % 7.5 % (9.0) % 26.7 %\nNightclubs Bombshells Other Corporate Total\nIncome (loss) from operations $ 13,056 $ 9,237 $ (614) $ (18,933) $ 2,746\nAmortization of intangibles 211 15 383 - 609\nSettlement of lawsuits 174 - - - 174\nImpairment of assets 10,370 245 - - 10,615\nLoss (gain) on sale of businesses and assets (639) 16 - (38) (661)\nLoss (gain) on insurance 433 - - (13) 420\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss) $ 23,605 $ 9,513 $ (231) $ (18,984) $ 13,903\nGAAP operating margin 14.8 % 21.4 % (83.1) % (14.3) % 2.1 %\nNon-GAAP operating margin 26.7 % 22.0 % (31.3) % (14.3) % 10.5 %\nOther Income/Expenses\nInterest expense increased by $2.0 million from 2021 to 2022 and by $181,000 from 2020 to 2021. The increase in interest expense in 2022 was primarily caused by the significantly higher average debt balance from borrowings to finance our acquisitions. The net increase in interest expense in 2021 was primarily caused by the expensed loan costs and written off unamortized debt issuance costs related to the September 2021 Refinancing Note (see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements), partially offset by the impact of a lower average debt balance. During 2020, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain debt principal and interest payments were deferred, but we continued to accrue interest on these debts. At the end of 2021, we refinanced several of our existing bank and seller-financed real estate debt with the issuance of a $99.1 million 5.25% note with a term of 10 years.\nWe consider lease plus interest expense as our occupancy costs since most of our debts are for real properties where our clubs and restaurants are located. For occupancy cost purposes, we exclude non-real-estate-related interest expense. Total occupancy cost rate (total occupancy cost as a percentage of revenues) was high in 2020 due to lower sales activity caused by the pandemic, as shown below.\n2022 2021 2020\nLease 2.5 % 2.0 % 3.1 %\nInterest 4.5 % 4.8 % 7.4 %\nTotal occupancy cost 7.0 % 6.8 % 10.5 %\nThe 2021 interest expense rate above excludes certain costs and charges related to the September 2021 Refinancing Note amounting to approximately $637,000, or 0.3% of consolidated revenues. The $637,000 interest expense includes $103,000 in unamortized debt issuance costs that were written off and $228,000 in expensed new loan costs.\nIn fiscal 2021, we received 11 notices of forgiveness for our PPP loans approving the forgiveness of 100% of each of the 11 PPP loans amounting to $5.3 million in principal and interest, which were included in non-operating gains (losses), net. In November 2021, we received a partial forgiveness of the remaining $124,000 PPP loan for $85,000 in principal and interest. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes were an expense of approximately $14.1 million in 2022, $4.0 million in 2021, and a benefit of $493,000 in 2020. Our effective income tax rate was a 23.4% expense in 2022, 11.7% expense in 2021, and 7.2% benefit in 2020. The components of our annual effective income tax rate are the following:\n2022 2021 2020\nFederal statutory income tax expense/benefit 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit 3.0 % 2.1 % (3.7) %\nPermanent differences 0.2 % (1.3) % (5.8) %\nChange in state tax rate 1.5 % (2.4) % - %\nChange in valuation allowance 0.6 % (1.9) % (18.7) %\nTax credits (3.0) % (3.5) % 13.9 %\nOther 0.2 % (2.4) % 0.6 %\nTotal effective income tax rate 23.4 % 11.7 % 7.2 %\n*Positive or negative percentages are in relation to income or loss before income taxes of the respective fiscal year.\nThe effective income tax rate difference from the statutory federal corporate tax rate of 21% comes from offsetting impact of state income tax, net of federal benefit, and tax credits that are mostly FICA tip credits. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2020 was also affected by the pre-tax loss mostly caused by the pandemic and the changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in all three fiscal years presented.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, within the meaning of the SEC Regulation G, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We monitor non-GAAP financial measures because it describes the operating performance of the Company and helps management and investors gauge our ability to generate cash flow, excluding (or including) some items that management believes are not representative of the ongoing business operations of the Company, but are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Relative to each of the non-GAAP financial measures, we further set forth our rationale as follows:\nNon-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Operating Margin. We calculate non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin by excluding the following items from income from operations and operating margin: (a) amortization of intangibles, (b) impairment of assets, (c) gains or losses on sale of businesses and assets, (d) gains or losses on insurance, (e) settlement of lawsuits, (f) costs and charges related to debt refinancing, and (g) stock-based compensation. We believe that excluding these items assists investors in evaluating period-over-period changes in our operating income and operating margin without the impact of items that are not a result of our day-to-day business and operations.\nNon-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income per Diluted Share. We calculate non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share by excluding or including certain items to net income attributable to RCIHH common stockholders and diluted earnings per share. Adjustment items are: (a) amortization of intangibles, (b) impairment of assets,\n(c) gains or losses on sale of businesses and assets, (d) gains or losses on insurance, (e) unrealized loss on equity securities, (f) settlement of lawsuits, (g) gain on debt extinguishment, (h) costs and charges related to debt refinancing, (i) stock-based compensation, (j) the income tax effect of the above-described adjustments, and (k) change in deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Included in the income tax effect of the above adjustments is the net effect of the non-GAAP provision for income taxes, calculated at 22.8%, 13.5%, and 26.0% effective tax rate of the pre-tax non-GAAP income before taxes for the 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and the GAAP income tax expense (benefit). We believe that excluding and including such items help management and investors better understand our operating activities.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We calculate adjusted EBITDA by excluding the following items from net income attributable to RCIHH common stockholders: (a) depreciation and amortization, (b) income tax expense (benefit), (c) net interest expense, (d) gains or losses on sale of businesses and assets, (e) gains or losses on insurance (f) unrealized gains or losses on equity securities, (g) impairment of assets, (h) settlement of lawsuits, (i) gain on debt extinguishment, and (j) stock-based compensation. We believe that adjusting for such items helps management and investors better understand our operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA provides a core operational performance measurement that compares results without the need to adjust for federal, state and local taxes which have considerable variation between domestic jurisdictions. The results are, therefore, without consideration of financing alternatives of capital employed. We use adjusted EBITDA as one guideline to assess the unleveraged performance return on our investments. Adjusted EBITDA multiple is also used as a target benchmark for our acquisitions of nightclubs.\nWe also use certain non-GAAP cash flow measures such as free cash flow. See Liquidity and Capital Resources section for further discussion.\nThe following tables present our non-GAAP performance measures for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages):\n2022 2021 2020\nReconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA\nNet income (loss) attributable to RCIHH common stockholders $ 46,041 $ 30,336 $ (6,085)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 14,071 3,989 (493)\nInterest expense, net 11,539 9,739 9,487\nSettlement of lawsuits 1,417 1,349 174\nImpairment of assets 1,888 13,612 10,615\nGain on sale of businesses and assets (2,375) (522) (661)\nDepreciation and amortization 12,391 8,238 8,836\nUnrealized loss on equity securities - 84 64\nGain on debt extinguishment (138) (5,329) -\nLoss (gain) on insurance (463) (1,253) 420\nStock-based compensation 2,353 - -\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 86,724 $ 60,243 $ 22,357\nReconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to non-GAAP net income\nNet income (loss) attributable to RCIHH common stockholders $ 46,041 $ 30,336 $ (6,085)\nAmortization of intangibles 2,118 258 609\nSettlement of lawsuits 1,417 1,349 174\nImpairment of assets 1,888 13,612 10,615\nGain on sale of businesses and assets (2,375) (522) (661)\nCosts and charges related to debt refinancing* - 694 -\nUnrealized loss on equity securities - 84 64\nGain on debt extinguishment (138) (5,329) -\nLoss (gain) on insurance (463) (1,253) 420\nStock-based compensation 2,353 - -\nChange in deferred tax asset valuation allowance 343 (632) 1,273\nNet income tax effect (729) (1,845) (1,700)\nNon-GAAP net income $ 50,455 $ 36,752 $ 4,709\n2022 2021 2020\nReconciliation of GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share\nDiluted shares 9,383,445 9,004,744 9,199,225\nGAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share $ 4.91 $ 3.37 $ (0.66)\nAmortization of intangibles 0.23 0.03 0.07\nSettlement of lawsuits 0.15 0.15 0.02\nImpairment of assets 0.20 1.51 1.15\nGain on sale of businesses and assets (0.25) (0.06) (0.07)\nCosts and charges related to debt refinancing* - 0.08 -\nUnrealized loss on equity securities - 0.01 0.01\nGain on debt extinguishment (0.01) (0.59) -\nLoss (gain) on insurance (0.05) (0.14) 0.05\nStock-based compensation 0.25 - -\nChange in deferred tax asset valuation allowance 0.04 (0.07) 0.14\nNet income tax effect (0.08) (0.20) (0.18)\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 5.38 $ 4.08 $ 0.51\nReconciliation of GAAP operating income to non-GAAP operating income\nIncome from operations $ 71,459 $ 38,548 $ 2,746\nAmortization of intangibles 2,118 258 609\nSettlement of lawsuits 1,417 1,349 174\nImpairment of assets 1,888 13,612 10,615\nCosts and charges related to debt refinancing* - 57 -\nGain on sale of businesses and assets (2,375) (522) (661)\nLoss (gain) on insurance (463) (1,253) 420\nStock-based compensation 2,353 - -\nNon-GAAP operating income $ 76,397 $ 52,049 $ 13,903\n2022 2021 2020\nReconciliation of GAAP operating margin to non-GAAP operating margin\nGAAP operating margin 26.7 % 19.7 % 2.1 %\nAmortization of intangibles 0.8 % 0.1 % 0.5 %\nSettlement of lawsuits 0.5 % 0.7 % 0.1 %\nImpairment of assets 0.7 % 7.0 % 8.0 %\nCosts and charges related to debt refinancing* - % 0.0 % - %\nGain on sale of businesses and assets (0.9) % (0.3) % (0.5) %\nLoss (gain) on insurance (0.2) % (0.6) % 0.3 %\nStock-based compensation 0.9 % - % - %\nNon-GAAP operating margin 28.5 % 26.7 % 10.5 %\n* Costs and charges related to debt refinancing in 2021 consist of $637,000 in interest expense and $57,000 in legal and professional fees. The $637,000 interest expense portion above includes $103,000 in unamortized debt issuance costs that were written off and $228,000 in expensed new loan costs.\nThe adjustments to reconcile net income attributable to RCIHH common stockholders to non-GAAP net income exclude the impact of adjustments related to noncontrolling interests, which is immaterial.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAt September 30, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $36.0 million as compared to $35.7 million at September 30, 2021. Because of the large volume of cash we handle, we have very stringent cash controls. As of September 30, 2022, we had working capital of $18.6 million compared to working capital of $26.1 million as of September 30, 2021, excluding net assets held for sale (net of associated liabilities of $0 and $1.1 million, respectively) amounting to $1.0 million and $3.8 million as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Since the pandemic hard hit fiscal 2020, we have since recovered and have seen a more normal stream of operations in 2021 and 2022. Geopolitical and macroeconomic events are still developing. In the event global inflation leads to a major economic downturn, our business operations and cash flow could be significantly affected. We believe that we can borrow capital if needed but currently we do not have unused credit facilities so there can be no guarantee that additional liquidity will be readily available or available on favorable terms.\nWe have not recently raised capital through the issuance of equity securities although we have used equity recently in one of our acquisitions. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on stockholders equity. We have a history of borrowing funds in private transactions and from sellers in acquisition transactions and have secured traditional bank financing on our new development projects and refinancing of our existing notes payable, but there can be no assurance that any of these financing options would be presently available on favorable terms, if at all. We also have historically utilized these cash flows to invest in property and equipment, adult nightclubs, and restaurants/sports bars.\nDuring 2022, we acquired fifteen clubs at an aggregate acquisition price of $132.6 million, of which $55.3 million was in cash, $49.0 million in debt, and $30.0 million in equity (500,000 shares of our common stock with an acquisition date fair value of $29.9 million, discounted for lack of marketability due to the lock-up period).\nWe expect to generate adequate cash flows from operations for the next 12 months from the issuance of this report.\nThe following table presents a summary of our net cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities (in thousands):\n2022 2021 2020\nOperating $ 64,509 $ 41,991 $ 15,632\nInvesting (67,797) (6,814) (994)\nFinancing 3,582 (15,096) (13,130)\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 294 $ 20,081 $ 1,508\nWe require capital principally for the acquisition of new clubs, construction of new Bombshells, renovation of older units, and investments in technology. We also utilize capital to repurchase our common stock as part of our share repurchase program, based on our capital allocation strategy guidelines, and to pay our quarterly dividends.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFollowing are our summarized cash flows from operating activities (in thousands):\n2022 2021 2020\nNet income (loss) $ 46,060 $ 30,150 $ (6,312)\nDepreciation and amortization 12,391 8,238 8,836\nDeferred tax expense (benefit) 3,080 (1,253) (1,268)\nStock-based compensation expense 2,353 - -\nImpairment of assets 1,888 13,612 10,615\nGain on debt extinguishment (83) (5,298) -\nNet change in operating assets and liabilities (1,421) (3,451) 1,380\nOther 241 (7) 2,381\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 64,509 $ 41,991 $ 15,632\nNet cash flows from operating activities increased from 2021 to 2022 mainly due to the operating results of the fifteen acquired clubs and one Bombshells opened. Net cash flows from operating activities increased from 2020 to 2021 mainly due to significantly higher income from operations partially offset by higher interest payments, which included deferred debt interest payments from 2020, and higher income taxes paid.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nFollowing are our summarized cash flows from investing activities (in thousands):\n2022 2021 2020\nProceeds from sale of businesses and assets $ 10,669 $ 5,415 $ 2,221\nProceeds from notes receivable 182 130 1,576\nProceeds from insurance 648 1,152 945\nPayments for property and equipment and intangible assets (24,003) (13,511) (5,736)\nAcquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired (55,293) - -\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (67,797) $ (6,814) $ (994)\nIn 2022, we acquired fifteen clubs with an aggregate acquisition price of $132.6 million, of which $55.3 million in cash, $49.0 million in debt, and 500,000 shares of our common stock in equity. We also purchased an aircraft and six real estate properties, of which, four are for future Bombshells locations, one for a club that we were leasing, and another to replace a club location which was taken by eminent domain. Also in 2022, we received payment for four real estate properties. We did not receive payment for the eminent domain property mentioned above until November 2022. In 2021, we acquired four real estate properties either for future club or restaurant locations or for corporate use. On one of the real properties purchased, we opened a Bombshells restaurant on December 6, 2021 in Arlington, Texas. There were no new Bombshells units opened in 2021. We also sold two real estate properties in 2021. We opened two new Bombshells units in 2020 (one in Katy, Texas and another on U.S. Highway 59 in Houston, Texas) and sold three real estate properties. As of September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we had $1.5 million, $3.4 million, and $20,000 in construction-in-progress related mostly to Bombshells opening in the subsequent fiscal year. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of our additions to property and equipment for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 (in thousands):\n2022 2021 2020\nNew capital expenditures in new clubs and Bombshells units and equipment* $ 18,405 $ 7,604 $ 3,585\nMaintenance capital expenditures 5,598 5,907 2,151\nTotal capital expenditures, excluding business acquisitions $ 24,003 $ 13,511 $ 5,736\n*Includes real estate except those acquired through business acquisitions.\nSee discussion of acquisitions and dispositions subsequent to September 30, 2022 in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFollowing are our summarized cash flows from financing activities (in thousands):\n2022 2021 2020\nProceeds from debt obligations $ 35,820 $ 38,490 $ 6,503\nPayments on debt obligations (14,894) (49,178) (8,832)\nPurchase of treasury stock (15,097) (1,794) (9,484)\nPayment of dividends (1,784) (1,440) (1,286)\nPayment of loan origination costs (463) (1,174) -\nDistribution to noncontrolling interests - - (31)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 3,582 $ (15,096) $ (13,130)\nSee Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our debt obligations.\nWe purchased shares of our common stock representing 268,185 shares, 74,659 shares, and 516,102 shares in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We paid quarterly dividends of $0.03 per share in fiscal 2020, except in the second and fourth quarter of 2020 where we paid $0.04 per share. We paid quarterly dividends of $0.04 per share in fiscal 2021 through the first quarter of 2022. Then starting in the second quarter of 2022, we increased our quarterly dividends to $0.05 per share.\nNon-GAAP Cash Flow Measure\nManagement also uses certain non-GAAP cash flow measures such as free cash flow. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures. We use free cash flow as the baseline for the implementation of our capital allocation strategy. See table below (in thousands):\n2022 2021 2020\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 64,509 $ 41,991 $ 15,632\nLess: Maintenance capital expenditures 5,598 5,907 2,151\nFree cash flow $ 58,911 $ 36,084 $ 13,481\nWe do not include total capital expenditures as a reduction from net cash flow from operating activities to arrive at free cash flow. This is because, based on our capital allocation strategy, acquisitions and development of our own clubs and restaurants are our primary uses of free cash flow.\nDebt Financing\nSee Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for more details regarding our debt activity.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe have long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of debt obligations and operating leases. The following table (in thousands) summarizes our contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments. Future interest payments related to debt were estimated using the interest rate in effect as of September 30, 2022.\nPayments Due by Period\nTotal 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter\nDebt obligations - regular(a)\n$ 106,102 $ 10,216 $ 9,663 $ 9,527 $ 9,825 $ 10,424 $ 56,447\nDebt obligations - balloon(a)\n99,738 2,226 2,195 20,457 - - 74,860\nInterest payments on debt 78,616 12,792 11,987 9,468 8,418 7,820 28,131\nOperating leases(b)\n52,789 4,895 4,944 5,024 5,089 4,895 27,942\n(a)See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.\n(b)See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOther than the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the current geopolitical and macroeconomic events happening globally, and the notes payable financing described above, we are not aware of any event or trend that would adversely impact our liquidity. In our opinion, working capital is not a true indicator of our financial status. Typically, businesses in our industry carry current liabilities in excess of current assets because businesses in our industry receive substantially immediate payment for sales, with nominal receivables, while inventories and other current liabilities normally carry longer payment terms. Vendors and purveyors often remain flexible with payment terms, providing businesses in our industry with opportunities to adjust to short-term business downturns. We consider the primary indicators of financial status to be the long-term trend of revenue growth, the mix of sales revenues, overall cash flow, profitability from operations and the level of long-term debt.\nThe following table presents a summary of such indicators (dollars in thousands):\n2022 Inc (Dec) 2021 Inc (Dec) 2020\nSales of alcoholic beverages $ 113,316 30.7 % $ 86,685 46.7 % $ 59,080\nSales of food and merchandise 44,294 7.7 % 41,111 68.1 % 24,460\nService revenues 93,888 69.3 % 55,461 34.7 % 41,162\nOther revenues 16,122 34.3 % 12,001 57.4 % 7,625\nTotal revenues $ 267,620 37.1 % $ 195,258 47.6 % $ 132,327\nNet income (loss) attributable to RCIHH common stockholders $ 46,041 51.8 % $ 30,336 (598.5) % $ (6,085)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 64,509 53.6 % $ 41,991 168.6 % $ 15,632\nAdjusted EBITDA* $ 86,724 44.0 % $ 60,243 169.5 % $ 22,357\nFree cash flow* $ 58,911 63.3 % $ 36,084 167.7 % $ 13,481\nDebt (end of period) $ 202,463 61.8 % $ 125,168 (11.5) % $ 141,435\n*See definition and calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow under Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Liquidity and Capital Resources above.\nWe have not established financing other than the notes payable discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on reasonable terms in the future, if at all, should the need arise.\nShare Repurchase\nAs part of our capital allocation strategy, we buy back shares in the open market or through negotiated purchases, as authorized by our Board of Directors. During fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, we paid for treasury stock amounting to $15.1 million, $1.8 million, and $9.5 million representing 268,185 shares, 74,659 shares, and 516,102 shares, respectively. On May 24, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a $25.0 million increase in the Company's share repurchase program. We have approximately $18.9 million remaining to purchase additional shares as of September 30, 2022.\nFor additional details regarding our Board approved share repurchase plans, please refer to Item 5 - Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION\nTo the extent permitted by competition, we have managed to recover increased costs through price increases and may continue to do so. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.\nSEASONALITY\nOur nightclub operations are affected by seasonal factors. Historically, we have experienced reduced revenues from April through September (our fiscal third and fourth quarters) with the strongest operating results occurring during October through March (our fiscal first and second quarters), but in fiscal 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, revenues during the second through the fourth quarter were significantly reduced. Our revenues in certain markets are also affected by sporting events that cause unusual changes in sales from year to year.\nGROWTH STRATEGY\nWe believe that we can continue to grow organically and through careful entry into markets with high growth potential. Our growth strategy includes acquiring existing units, opening new units after market analysis, developing new club concepts that are consistent with our management and marketing skills, franchising our Bombshells brand, and developing and opening our Bombshells concept as our capital and manpower allow.\nAll eleven of the existing Bombshells as of September 30, 2022 are located in Texas. Our growth strategy is to diversify our operations with these units which do not require SOB licenses, which are sometimes difficult to obtain. While we are searching for adult nightclubs to acquire, we are able to also search for restaurant/sports bar locations that are consistent with our income targets.\nWe opened two new Bombshells units in fiscal 2020.\nIn 2022, we acquired fifteen clubs with an aggregate acquisition price of $132.6 million, of which $55.3 million in cash, $49.0 million in debt, and 500,000 shares of our common stock in equity. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. We also opened a new Bombshells location in Arlington, Texas in December 2021 and our first franchised location in San Antonio, Texas opened in June 2022.\nOn October 26, 2022, subsequent to the current reporting date, the Company completed the acquisition of a club in Dickinson, Texas for a total acquisition price of $9.0 million. The acquisition includes (1) $2.5 million for the adult entertainment business covered in a stock purchase agreement paid fully in cash at closing and (2) $6.5 million for the real estate property covered in a real estate purchase agreement paid $1.5 million in cash at closing and $5.0 million under a 6% 15-year promissory note payable in 180 equal monthly payments of $42,193 in principal and interest.\nWe continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire new nightclubs and anticipate acquiring new locations that fit our business model as we have done in the past. The acquisition of additional clubs may require us to take on additional debt or issue our common stock, or both. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on reasonable terms in the future, if at all, should the need arise. An inability to obtain such additional financing could have an adverse effect on our growth strategy. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe items in our financial statements subject to market risk are potential debt instruments with variable interest rates. We do not carry any debt with a variable interest rate in effect as of September 30, 2022. Certain of our debt have variable interest rates but will only be effective in future years. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe information required by this Item begins on page 47.\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (Friedman LLP, Marlton, NJ, Auditor Firm ID: 711)\nConsolidated Financial Statements:\nConsolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Equity for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nRCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc.\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes and schedule (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated December 14, 2022 expressed an adverse opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nImpairment of Goodwill, Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets, and Long-lived Assets\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis for impairment, or when events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Additionally, the Company reviews long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, intangible assets subject to amortization, and right-of-use assets on operating leases for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Companys evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, and impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets is recognized in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceed their fair value. Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If these assets are determined to be\nimpaired, the amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Fair value is generally determined using forecasted cash flows discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had goodwill of approximately $67.8 million, and indefinite-lived intangible assets of approximately $117.1 million. Long-lived assets consisted of property and equipment, right of use assets, and intangible assets subject to amortization totaling approximately $288.6 million. During the year ended September 30, 2022 the Company recorded an impairment of these assets of approximately $1.9 million.\nWe identified the evaluation of the impairment analysis of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and long-lived assets as a critical audit matter. There was a high degree of subjective auditor judgment in evaluating the estimated undiscounted future cash flows used to test operating locations for recoverability and the determination of fair value of the relevant assets when required. Specifically, a high degree of subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate future revenues, operating cash flows and the discount rate.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Companys goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible asset, and long-lived asset impairment process, including controls over the identification of relevant assets at risk of impairment, the determination of estimated undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of individual reporting unit or asset, as necessary, and controls over the key assumptions as noted above. These procedures also included, among others, (1) testing managements process for developing the fair value estimates of the reporting units or assets; (2) evaluating the appropriateness of the underlying discounted and undiscounted cash flow models; (3) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the models; and (4) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management, including the future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. Evaluating managements significant assumptions related to future cash flows, growth rates and the discount rates involved, with the assistance of valuation specialists employed by us, evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (1) the historical performance of the reporting units or operating location; (2) the consistency with external market data; and (3) sensitivities over significant inputs and assumptions, including the development of a point estimate.\nFair Value Measurement of consideration and, tangible and intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions\nAs described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed five business acquisitions with an aggregate acquisition price totaling approximately $132.6 million during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method, which requires recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The fair value of the tangible assets acquired were measured using adjusted market prices or costs to construct. The fair values of intangible assets acquired are typically estimated using an income approach, which is based on the present value of future discounted cash flows. Management applied significant judgment in estimating the fair value of the consideration and, tangible and intangible assets acquired, which involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the rate of future revenue growth, profitability of the acquired business and the discount rate, among other factors. In addition, the discount for lack of marketability applied to the consideration is estimated using a market approach, which is based on a Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value measurement of the consideration and assets acquired related to the acquisitions is a critical audit matter are (1) the significant judgment by management, including the use of specialists, when estimating the fair values of assets acquired; (2) a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures relating to the fair value measurement of assets acquired; (3) the significant audit effort in evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions relating to the rate of future revenue growth and profitability of the acquired business and the discount rate; and (4) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included identifying and evaluating the design of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over managements valuation of the assets acquired and consideration, and controls over the development of the valuation models, as well as the significant assumptions related to the rate of future revenue growth, profitability of the acquired business, the discount rate, and the costs to construct an asset. These procedures also included, among others, (1) reading the purchase agreement; and (2) testing managements process for estimating the fair values of the assets acquired. Testing managements process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation method, testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by\nmanagement, and evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to the rate of future revenue growth, profitability of the acquired business, the discount rate, and costs to construct an asset. Evaluating the reasonableness of the rate of future revenue growth and the profitability of the acquired business involved considering the historical performance of the acquired businesses and market comparable information, as well as economic and industry forecasts. The reasonableness of the discount rate was evaluated by considering the cost of capital of comparable businesses and other industry factors. (3) Developing an independent point estimate for the consideration. (4) Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models, the reasonableness of the discount rate, and evaluating the market and cost assumptions for the fair value of the assets; and in developing a model and independent assumptions for the consideration.\n/s/ Friedman LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2019.\nMarlton, New Jersey\nDecember 14, 2022\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except par value and number of shares)\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 35,980 $ 35,686\nAccounts receivable, net 8,510 7,570\nCurrent portion of notes receivable 230 220\nInventories 3,893 2,659\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 1,499 1,928\nAssets held for sale 1,049 4,887\nTotal current assets 51,161 52,950\nProperty and equipment, net 224,615 175,952\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net 37,048 24,308\nNotes receivable, net of current portion 4,691 2,839\nGoodwill 67,767 39,379\nIntangibles, net 144,049 67,824\nOther assets 1,407 1,367\nTotal assets $ 530,738 $ 364,619\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable $ 5,482 $ 4,408\nAccrued liabilities 11,328 10,403\nCurrent portion of long-term debt 11,896 6,434\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities 2,795 1,780\nTotal current liabilities 31,501 23,025\nDeferred tax liability, net 30,562 19,137\nDebt, net of current portion and debt discount and issuance costs 190,567 118,734\nOperating lease liabilities, net of current portion 36,001 24,150\nOther long-term liabilities 349 350\nTotal liabilities 288,980 185,396\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 11)\nEquity\nPreferred stock, $0.10 par value per share; 1,000,000 shares authorized; none issued and outstanding\n- -\nCommon stock, $0.01 par value per share; 20,000,000 shares authorized; 9,231,725 shares and 8,999,910 shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n92 90\nAdditional paid-in capital 67,227 50,040\nRetained earnings 173,950 129,693\nTotal RCIHH stockholders equity 241,269 179,823\nNoncontrolling interests 489 (600)\nTotal equity 241,758 179,223\nTotal liabilities and equity $ 530,738 $ 364,619\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in thousands, except per share and number of shares data)\nYears Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nRevenues\nSales of alcoholic beverages $ 113,316 $ 86,685 $ 59,080\nSales of food and merchandise 44,294 41,111 24,460\nService revenues 93,888 55,461 41,162\nOther 16,122 12,001 7,625\nTotal revenues 267,620 195,258 132,327\nOperating expenses\nCost of goods sold\nAlcoholic beverages sold 20,155 15,883 11,097\nFood and merchandise sold 15,537 13,794 8,071\nService and other 317 374 267\nTotal cost of goods sold (exclusive of items shown separately below) 36,009 30,051 19,435\nSalaries and wages 68,447 50,627 39,070\nSelling, general and administrative 78,847 54,608 51,692\nDepreciation and amortization 12,391 8,238 8,836\nOther charges, net 467 13,186 10,548\nTotal operating expenses 196,161 156,710 129,581\nIncome from operations 71,459 38,548 2,746\nOther income (expenses)\nInterest expense (11,950) (9,992) (9,811)\nInterest income 411 253 324\nNon-operating gain (loss), net 211 5,330 (64)\nIncome (loss) before income taxes 60,131 34,139 (6,805)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 14,071 3,989 (493)\nNet income (loss) 46,060 30,150 (6,312)\nNet loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests (19) 186 227\nNet income (loss) attributable to RCIHH common stockholders $ 46,041 $ 30,336 $ (6,085)\nEarnings (loss) per share\nBasic and diluted $ 4.91 $ 3.37 $ (0.66)\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding\nBasic and diluted 9,383,445 9,004,744 9,199,225\nDividends per share $ 0.19 $ 0.16 $ 0.14\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nYears Ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020\n(in thousands, except number of shares)\nCommon Stock Additional\nPaid-In\nCapital Retained\nEarnings Treasury Stock Noncontrolling\nInterests Total\nEquity\nNumber\nof Shares Amount Number\nof Shares Amount\nBalance at September 30, 2019 9,590,671 $ 96 $ 61,312 $ 108,168 -

Nature of Business\nRCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. (the Company, we, us, or our) is a holding company incorporated in Texas in 1994. Through its subsidiaries, the Company currently owns and operates establishments that offer live adult entertainment, restaurant, and/or bar operations. These establishments are located in Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth, Tomball, Katy, Pearland, Odessa, Lubbock, Longview, Tye, Aledo, Round Rock, Edinburg, El Paso, Harlingen, Arlington, and Beaumont, Texas, as well as Denver, Colorado; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina; New York and Newburgh, New York; Miami, Pembroke Park and Miami Gardens, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; Sulphur, Louisiana; Portland, Maine; Louisville, Kentucky; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Chicago, Washington Park, Sauget, and Kappa, Illinois. The Company also owns and operates media businesses for the adult industry. The Companys corporate offices are located in Houston, Texas.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Accounting\nThe accounts are maintained and the consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP or GAAP).\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is owned. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on September 30. References to years 2022, 2021, and 2020 are for fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Our fiscal quarters chronologically end on December 31, March 31, June 30 and September 30.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, forecasted future events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions may vary under different circumstances and conditions. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers as cash equivalents all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. The Company maintains deposits in several financial institutions, which may at times exceed amounts covered by insurance provided by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The Company has not experienced any losses related to amounts in excess of FDIC limits.\nAccounts and Notes Receivable\nAccounts receivable for club and restaurant operations are primarily comprised of credit card charges, which are generally converted to cash in two to five days after a purchase is made. The media divisions accounts receivable are primarily comprised of receivables for advertising sales and Expo registration. Accounts receivable also include employee advances, construction advances, and other miscellaneous receivables. Long-term notes receivable, which have original maturity of more than one year, include consideration from the sale of certain investment interest entities and real estate. The Company\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued\nrecognizes interest income on notes receivable based on the terms of the agreement and based upon managements evaluation that the notes receivable and interest income will be collected. The Company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts or notes when, based on management judgment, circumstances indicate that accounts or notes receivable will not be collected. Allowance for doubtful accounts balance related to accounts receivable was $30,000 and $382,000 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (see Note 5). Allowance for doubtful accounts balance related to notes receivable was $0 and $102,000 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nInventories\nInventories include alcoholic beverages, energy drinks, food, and Company merchandise. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis), or net realizable value.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Provisions for depreciation and amortization are made using straight-line rates over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, and the shorter of useful lives or terms of the applicable leases for leasehold improvements. Buildings have estimated useful lives ranging from 29 to 40 years. Furniture and equipment have estimated useful lives of 5 to 7 years, while leasehold improvements are depreciated at the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives are capitalized. Expenditures for normal maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The cost of assets sold, retired or abandoned and the related accumulated depreciation are written off from the accounts, and any gains or losses are charged or credited in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations of the respective period. Interest expense from related debt incurred during site construction is capitalized, which amounted to $0 in fiscal 2022, $0 in fiscal 2021, and $156,000 in fiscal 2020.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but reviewed on an annual basis for impairment. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives.\nThe costs of transferable licenses purchased through open markets are capitalized as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The costs of obtaining non-transferable licenses that are directly issued by local government agencies are expensed as incurred. Annual license renewal fees are expensed over their renewal term.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment during our fourth fiscal quarter and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets fair value.\nFor our goodwill impairment review, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. This assessment is based on several factors, including industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, including an assessment of cash flows in comparison to actual and projected results of prior periods. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value based on our qualitative analysis, or if we elect to skip this step, we perform a Step 1 quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value is determined using market-related valuation models, including discounted cash flows and comparable asset market values. We recognize goodwill impairment in the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit, based on the results of our Step 1 analysis. For the year ended September 30, 2022, we identified one reporting unit that was impaired and recognized a goodwill impairment loss of $566,000. For the year ended September 30, 2021, we identified seven reporting units that were impaired and recognized a goodwill impairment loss totaling $6.3 million. For the year ended September 30, 2020, we identified seven reporting units that were impaired and recognized a goodwill impairment loss totaling $7.9 million.\nFor indefinite-lived intangibles, specifically sexually-oriented business (\"SOB\") licenses, we determine fair value by estimating the multiperiod excess earnings of the asset. For indefinite-lived tradename, we determine fair value by using\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued\nthe relief from royalty method. The fair value is then compared to the carrying value and an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. We recorded impairment charges for SOB licenses amounting to $293,000 in 2022 related to one club, $5.3 million in 2021 related to three clubs, $2.3 million in 2020 related to two clubs, which are included in other charges, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, intangible assets subject to amortization, and right-of-use assets on operating leases for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining useful life of the primary asset included in the asset group. If the asset group is not recoverable, the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. We define our asset group as an operating club or restaurant location, which is also our reporting unit or the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. For assets held for sale, we measure fair value using an estimation based on quoted prices for similar items in active or inactive markets (level 2) developed using observable data. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. During fiscal 2022, the Company impaired one club and one Bombshells for a total of $1.0 million; during fiscal 2021, the Company impaired five clubs (including one later reclassified as held for sale) for a total of $2.0 million; and during fiscal 2020, the Company impaired one club and one Bombshells unit for a total of $302,000. The Company also impaired one club in fiscal of 2020 for operating lease right-of-use assets amounting to $104,000. See Notes 6 and 20.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company calculates the fair value of its assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of these financial instruments. The estimated fair value of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of notes receivable and short and long-term debt also approximates fair value since these instruments bear market rates of interest. None of these instruments are held for trading purposes.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from the sale of alcoholic beverages, food and merchandise, service and other revenues at the point-of-sale upon receipt of cash, check, or credit card charge, net of discounts and promotional allowances based on consideration specified in implied contracts with customers. Sales and liquor taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation (point in time of sale) by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.\nCommission revenues, such as ATM commission, are recognized when the basis for such commission has transpired. Revenues from the sale of magazines and advertising content are recognized when the issue is published and shipped. Revenues and external expenses related to the Companys annual Expo convention are recognized upon the completion of the convention, which normally occurs during our fiscal fourth quarter. Lease revenue (included in other revenues) is recognized when earned (recognized over time) and is more appropriately covered by guidance under ASC 842, Leases.\nRevenue from initial franchise and area development fees are recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied over the term of the franchise agreement. Franchise royalties and advertising contributions, which are a percentage of net sales of franchised restaurants, are recognized in the period the related sales occur.\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued\nRefer to Notes 4 and 20 for additional disclosures on revenues and leases, respectively.\nAdvertising and Marketing\nAdvertising and marketing expenses are primarily comprised of costs related to public advertisements and giveaways, which are used for promotional purposes. Advertising and marketing expenses are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. See Note 5.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax and income taxes imposed in the state and local jurisdictions where we operate our businesses. Deferred income taxes are determined using the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In addition, a valuation allowance is established to reduce any deferred tax asset for which it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nU.S. GAAP creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. We recognize penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses, and recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense.\nInvestments\nInvestments in companies in which the company has a 20% to 50% interest are accounted for using the equity method, which are carried at cost and adjusted for the Companys proportionate share of their undistributed earnings or losses. Investments in companies in which the Company owns less than a 20% interest, or where the Company does not exercise significant influence, are accounted for at cost and reviewed for any impairment. Cost and equity method investments are included in other assets in the Companys consolidated balance sheets.\nPaycheck Protection Program\nThe Companys policy is to account for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans as debt (see Note 9). The Company will continue to record the loans as debt until either (1) the loans are partially or entirely forgiven and the Company has been legally released from the obligation, at which point the amount forgiven will be recorded as income, or (2) the Company pays off the loans.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings or losses of the Company. Potential common stock shares consist of shares that may arise from outstanding dilutive common restricted stock, stock options and warrants (the number of which is computed using the treasury stock method) and from outstanding convertible debentures (the number of which is computed using the if-converted method). Diluted earnings (loss) per share considers the potential dilution that could occur if the Companys outstanding common restricted stock, stock options, warrants and convertible debentures were converted into common stock that then shared in the Companys earnings or losses (as adjusted for interest expense, that would no longer be incurred if the debentures were converted).\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company did not have any adjustment items to reconcile the numerator and the denominator in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share. For fiscal 2022, we\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued\nexcluded 300,000 stock options from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the effect was anti-dilutive. There were no other potentially dilutive securities outstanding during fiscal 2021 and 2020.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the recognition of acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the acquisition price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Results of operations related to acquired entities are included prospectively beginning with the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\nShare Repurchases\nThe Company accounts for treasury stock transactions using the cost method. When treasury shares are retired, we charge the excess of the repurchase price over the par value of the repurchased shares to additional paid-in capital.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes all employee stock-based compensation in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Equity-classified awards are measured at the grant date fair value of the award and recognized as expense over their requisite service period. The Company estimates grant date fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nThe following table provides the significant assumptions used in determining the estimated grant date fair value of the stock options granted in fiscal 2022. No grants were awarded in fiscal 2021 and 2020.\nExpected term (in years) 4.45\nExpected volatility 64.42 %\nExpected dividend yield 0.20 %\nRisk-free rate 3.23 %\nThe expected term was estimated using the historical exercise and post-vesting expiration behavior of grantees on stock options awarded prior to the 2022 Plan. The expected volatility was based on historical volatility of the Company's stock price for a period equal to the award's expected term. The expected dividend yield is based on the current dividend payout activity and the exercise price (that is, the expected dividends that would likely be reflected in an amount at which the stock option would be exchanged). The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. We recognize forfeitures when they occur.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility that we may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. The Company recognizes legal fees and expenses, including those related to legal contingencies, as incurred.\nGenerally, the Company recognizes gain contingencies when they are realized or when all related contingencies have been resolved.\nThe Company maintains insurance that covers claims arising from risks associated with the Companys business including claims for workers compensation, general liability, property, auto, and business interruption coverage. The Company carries substantial insurance to cover such risks with large deductibles and/or self-insured retention. These policies have\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued\nbeen structured to limit our per-occurrence exposure. The Company believes, and the Companys experience has been, that such insurance policies have been sufficient to cover such risks.\nFair Value Measurement\nThe Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. The Company determines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels.\nU.S. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nThe Company classifies its marketable securities as available-for-sale, which are reported at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related income tax effect, if any, on available-for-sale securities were excluded from income and were reported as accumulated other comprehensive income in equity until our adoption of ASU 2016-01 as of October 1, 2018. Realized gains and losses (and unrealized gains and losses upon the adoption of ASU 2016-01) from securities classified as available-for-sale are included in comprehensive income (loss). The Company measures the fair value of its marketable securities based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets, or Level 1 inputs.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company reviews its marketable securities to determine whether a decline in fair value of a security below the cost basis is other than temporary. Should the decline be considered other than temporary, the Company writes down the cost basis of the security and include the loss in current earnings as opposed to an unrealized holding loss. No losses or other-than-temporary impairments in our marketable securities portfolio were recognized during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nAssets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis relate primarily to tangible property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, which are remeasured when the derived fair value is below carrying value in the consolidated balance sheets. For these assets, the Company does not periodically adjust carrying value to fair value except in the event of impairment. If it is determined that impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to fair value and the difference is included in other charges, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2.

This ASU simplifies accounting for income taxes by removing the following exceptions: (1) exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation, (2) exceptions to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments, and (3) exception in interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. The ASU also improves financial statement preparers application of income tax related guidance for franchise taxes that are partially based on income; transactions with a government that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill; separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax; and enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. The ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for public business entities for periods for which financial statements have not been issued. An entity that elects early adoption in an interim period should reflect any adjustments as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period. Additionally, an entity that elects early adoption should adopt all the amendments in the same period. We adopted ASU 2019-12 on October 1, 2021. Our adoption of this update did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. This ASU amends Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805 to require acquiring entities to apply ASC 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in business combinations. The ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are still evaluating the impact of this ASU but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions. The amendments in this ASU clarify that an entity should measure the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual sale restriction the same way it measures an identical equity security that is not subject to such a restriction. The FASB said the contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, should not affect its fair value. The ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We have not yet evaluated the impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\n3. Ongoing Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur fiscal 2020 was the period hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic caused by significant reduction in customer traffic in our clubs and restaurants due to changes in consumer behavior as social distancing practices, dining room closures and other restrictions were mandated or encouraged by federal, state and local governments. In fiscal 2021, our businesses started to recover from the initial effects of the pandemic when government restrictions eased. Stimulus money also flowed to the economy at that time which prompted discretionary spending. In fiscal 2022, several coronavirus variants threatened to bring back tight restrictions. Along with the pandemic, geopolitical and macroeconomic events started to affect the U.S. economy in general, with global inflation and supply chain disruption impacting our businesses the most.\nGeopolitical and macroeconomic events are still developing. In the event global inflation leads to a major economic downturn, our business operations and cash flow could be significantly affected.\nValuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets\nWe considered the COVID-19 pandemic as a triggering event in the assessment of recoverability of the goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles, and long-lived assets in our clubs and restaurants that are affected. We evaluated forecasted cash flows considering future assumed impact of COVID-19 pandemic on sales. Going forward, because of the illness' anticipated permanence, we will no longer consider it as a triggering event for impairment purposes. Based on the evaluation we conducted during the interim and annual periods since the pandemic emerged, we determined that during the year ended September 30, 2020 our assets were impaired in a total amount of approximately $10.6 million comprised of $7.9 million in goodwill, $2.3 million in SOB licenses, $302,000 in property and equipment, and $104,000 in operating lease right-of-use assets. We recognized an additional $13.6 million of impairment during the year ended September 30, 2021 comprised of $6.3 million in goodwill, $5.3 million in SOB licenses, and $2.0 million in property and equipment, which included one property later reclassified as held for sale. During the year ended September 30, 2022, we recorded total impairment charges of $1.9 million comprised of $566,000 in goodwill, $293,000 in SOB license, and $1.0 million in property and equipment.\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n4.

To resolve the issue of taxes owed, the Company agreed to pay $10.0 million in equal monthly installments of $119,000, without interest, over 84 months, beginning in June 2015, for all but two nonsettled locations. For accounting purposes, the Company has discounted the $10.0 million at an imputed interest rate of 9.6%, establishing a net present value for the settlement of $7.2 million.

As a result of this, additional avenues of relief were available to workers and families through enhanced unemployment insurance provisions and to small businesses through programs administered by the Small Business Administration. The CARES Act included, among other items, provisions relating to payroll tax credits and deferrals, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credits and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. The CARES Act also established a Paycheck Protection Program, whereby certain small businesses are eligible for a loan to fund payroll expenses, rent, and related costs. The loan may be forgiven if the funds are used for payroll and other qualified expenses. The Company submitted its application for a PPP loan and on May 8, 2020 received approval and funding for its restaurants, shared service entity and lounge. Ten of our restaurant subsidiaries received amounts ranging from $271,000 to $579,000 for an aggregate amount of $4.2 million; our shared-services subsidiary received $1.1 million; and one of our lounges received $124,000. None of our adult nightclub and other non-core business subsidiaries received funding under the PPP. The Company believes it used the entire loan amount for qualifying expenses. Under the terms of the PPP, certain amounts of the loan may be forgiven if they are used for qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act. The Company utilized all of the PPP funds and submitted its forgiveness applications. During fiscal 2021, we received 11 Notices of PPP Forgiveness Payment from the Small Business Administration out of the 12 of our PPP loans granted. All of the notices received forgave 100% of each of the 11 PPP loans totaling the amount of $5.3 million in principal and interest and were included in non-operating gains (losses), net in our consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. In November 2021, we received a partial forgiveness of the remaining $124,000 PPP loan for $85,000 in principal and interest. The remaining unforgiven portion of approximately $41,000 in principal was fully paid as debt plus accrued interest in fiscal 2022.\n11. Commitments and Contingencies\nLeases\nSee Note 20.\nLegal Matters\nTexas Patron Tax\nIn 2015, the Company reached a settlement with the State of Texas over the payment of the states Patron Tax on adult club customers. To resolve the issue of taxes owed, the Company agreed to pay $10.0 million in equal monthly installments of $119,000, without interest, over 84 months, beginning in June 2015, for all but two non-settled locations. The Company agreed to remit the Patron Tax on a monthly basis, based on the current rate of $5 per customer. For accounting purposes, the Company has discounted the $10.0 million at an imputed interest rate of 9.6%, establishing a net present value for the settlement of $7.2 million. As a consequence, the Company recorded an $8.2 million pre-tax gain for the third quarter ended June 30, 2015, representing the difference between the $7.2 million and the amount previously accrued for the tax.\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n11. Commitments and Contingencies - continued\nIn March 2017, the Company settled with the State of Texas for one of the two remaining unsettled Patron Tax locations. To resolve the issue of taxes owed, the Company agreed to pay a total of $687,815 with $195,815 paid at the time the settlement agreement was executed followed by 60 equal monthly installments of $8,200 without interest. On April 20, 2022, the Company finally settled all of its remaining Patron Tax debt.\nA declaratory judgment action was brought by five operating subsidiaries of the Company to challenge a Texas Comptroller administrative rule related to the $5 per customer Patron Tax Fee assessed against Sexually Oriented Businesses. An administrative rule attempted to expand the fee to cover venues featuring dancers using latex cover as well as traditional nude entertainment. The administrative rule was challenged on both constitutional and statutory grounds. On November 19, 2018, the Court issued an order that a key aspect of the administrative rule is invalid based on it exceeding the scope of the Comptrollers authority. On March 6, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, Austin Division, ruled that the Texas Patron Tax is unconstitutional as it has been applied and enforced by the Comptroller. The State of Texas appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, who affirmed that the Texas Patron Fee is unconstitutional as applied. The State of Texas next sought review from the Supreme Court, but the high court declined to take the case. That lawsuit is now back before the trial court for post-trial proceedings but is final for purposes of determining the Texas Patron Fee is unconstitutional as applied to clubs featuring dancers using latex cover.\nIndemnity Insurance Corporation\nAs previously reported, the Company and its subsidiaries were insured under a liability policy issued by Indemnity Insurance Corporation, RRG (IIC) through October 25, 2013. The Company and its subsidiaries changed insurance companies on that date.\nOn November 7, 2013, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware entered a Rehabilitation and Injunction Order (Rehabilitation Order), which declared IIC impaired, insolvent and in an unsafe condition and placed IIC under the supervision of the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Delaware (Commissioner) in her capacity as receiver (Receiver). The Rehabilitation Order empowered the Commissioner to rehabilitate IIC through a variety of means, including gathering assets and marshaling those assets as necessary. Further, the order stayed or abated pending lawsuits involving IIC as the insurer until May 6, 2014.\nOn April 10, 2014, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware entered a Liquidation and Injunction Order With Bar Date (Liquidation Order), which ordered the liquidation of IIC and terminated all insurance policies or contracts of insurance issued by IIC. The Liquidation Order further ordered that all claims against IIC must have been filed with the Receiver before the close of business on January 16, 2015 and that all pending lawsuits involving IIC as the insurer were further stayed or abated until October 7, 2014. As a result, the Company and its subsidiaries no longer have insurance coverage under the liability policy with IIC. The Company has retained counsel to defend against and evaluate these claims and lawsuits. We are funding 100% of the costs of litigation and will seek reimbursement from the bankruptcy receiver. The Company filed the appropriate claims against IIC with the Receiver before the January 16, 2015 deadline and has provided updates as requested; however, there are no assurances of any recovery from these claims. It is unknown at this time what effect this uncertainty will have on the Company. As previously stated, since October 25, 2013, the Company has obtained general liability coverage from other insurers, which have covered and/or will cover any claims arising from actions after that date. As of September 30, 2022, we had 1 remaining unresolved claim out of the original 71 claims.\nShareholder Class and Derivative Actions\nIn May and June 2019, three putative securities class action complaints were filed against RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. and certain of its officers and directors in the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. The complaints alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 10b-5 promulgated thereunder based on alleged materially false and misleading statements made in the Companys SEC filings and disclosures as they relate to various alleged transactions by the Company and management. The cases were consolidated as In re RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc., No. 4:19-cv-01841. In January 2022, the parties engaged in settlement discussions beginning with a formal mediation on January 13, 2022, which resulted in an agreement-in-principle to resolve the matter. On January 24, 2022, a Joint Notice of Settlement was filed. On April 28, 2022, the Court preliminarily approved the settlement and form of class\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n11. Commitments and Contingencies - continued\nnotice. On August 12, 2022, the Court issued an order finally approving the settlement, which was funded by insurance carrier. No appeal was filed and hence the litigation has concluded.\nOn January 21, 2022, Shiva Stein and Kevin McCarty filed a shareholder derivative action in the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division against former director Nourdean Anakar, Yura Barabash, former director Steven L. Jenkins, Eric Langan, Luke Lirot, former CFO Phillip K. Marshall, Elaine J. Martin, Allan Priaulx, and Travis Reese as defendants, as well as against RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. as nominal defendant. The action, styled Stein v. Anakar, et al., No. 4:22-mc-00149 (S.D. Tex.), alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty based on alleged dissemination of inaccurate information, alleged failure to maintain internal controls, and alleged failure to properly manage company property. This action is in its preliminary phase, and a potential loss cannot yet be estimated. These allegations are substantively similar to claims asserted in the class action and a prior derivative action that was dismissed in June of 2021. RCI intends to vigorously defend against the action. On April 2, 2022, the Company and its current and former officers and directors named in the shareholder derivative complaint filed their Motions to Dismiss and the derivative plaintiffs have responded. The Motions now have been fully briefed for the Court's consideration.\nOther\nOn March 26, 2016, an image infringement lawsuit was filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York against the Company and several of its subsidiaries. Plaintiffs allege that their images were misappropriated, intentionally altered and published without their consent by clubs affiliated with the Company. The causes of action asserted in Plaintiffs Complaint included alleged violations of the Federal Lanham Act, the New York Civil Rights Act, and other statutory and common law theories. The Company contended that there was insurance coverage under an applicable insurance policy. The insurer raised several issues regarding coverage under the policy. This matter was settled at mediation in August 2022.\nOn June 23, 2014, Mark H. Dupray and Ashlee Dupray filed a lawsuit against Pedro Antonio Panameno and our subsidiary JAI Dining Services (Phoenix) Inc. (JAI Phoenix) in the Superior Court of Arizona for Maricopa County. The suit alleged that Mr. Panameno injured Mr. Dupray in a traffic accident after being served alcohol at an establishment operated by JAI Phoenix. The suit alleged that JAI Phoenix was liable under theories of common law dram shop negligence and dram shop negligence per se. After a jury trial proceeded to a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs against both defendants, in April 2017 the Court entered a judgment under which JAI Phoenixs share of compensatory damages is approximately $1.4 million and its share of punitive damages is $4 million. In May 2017, JAI Phoenix filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, motion for new trial. The Court denied this motion in August 2017. In September 2017, JAI Phoenix filed a notice of appeal. In June 2018, the matter was heard by the Arizona Court of Appeals. On November 15, 2018 the Court of Appeals vacated the jurys verdict and remanded the case to the trial court. It is anticipated that a new trial will occur at some point in the future. JAI Phoenix will continue to vigorously defend itself.\nAs set forth in the risk factors as disclosed in this report, the adult entertainment industry standard is to classify adult entertainers as independent contractors, not employees. While we take steps to ensure that our adult entertainers are deemed independent contractors, from time to time, we are named in lawsuits related to the alleged misclassification of entertainers. Claims are brought under both federal and where applicable, state law. Based on the industry standard, the manner in which the independent contractor entertainers are treated at the clubs, and the entertainer license agreements governing the entertainers work at the clubs, the Company believes that these lawsuits are without merit. Lawsuits are handled by attorneys with an expertise in the relevant law and are defended vigorously.\nGeneral\nIn the regular course of business affairs and operations, we are subject to possible loss contingencies arising from third-party litigation and federal, state, and local environmental, labor, health and safety laws and regulations. We assess the probability that we could incur liability in connection with certain of these lawsuits. Our assessments are made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as codified in ASC 450-20, and is not an admission of any liability on the part of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. In certain cases that are in the early stages and in light of the uncertainties surrounding them, we do not currently possess sufficient information to determine a range of reasonably possible liability. In matters where there is insurance coverage, in the event we incur any liability, we believe it is unlikely we would incur losses in connection with these claims in excess of our insurance coverage.\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n11. Commitments and Contingencies - continued\nSettlement of lawsuits for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 total $1.4 million, $1.3 million, and $174,000, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company has accrued $246,000 and $378,000 in accrued liabilities, respectively, related to settlement of lawsuits\n12. Common Stock\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2020, the following common stock transactions occurred:\nThe Company acquired 516,102 shares of its own common stock at a cost of $9.5 million. These shares were subsequently retired.\nThe Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.03 per share, except for the second and fourth quarters when $0.04 per share was paid, for an aggregate amount of $1.3 million.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2021, the following common stock transactions occurred:\nThe Company acquired 74,659 shares of its own common stock at a cost of $1.8 million.

These shares were subsequently retired.\nThe Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.05 per share, except for the first quarter when $0.04 per share was paid, for an aggregate amount of $1.8 million.\nOn October 18, 2021, we partially paid for an acquisition using 500,000 shares of our common stock. See Note 16.\n13. Stock-based Compensation\nOn February 7, 2022, our board of directors approved the 2022 Stock Option Plan (the 2022 Plan). The boards adoption of the 2022 Plan was approved by the shareholders during the annual stockholders' meeting on August 23, 2022. The 2022 Plan provides that the maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock underlying options that may be granted under the 2022 Plan is 300,000. The options granted under the 2022 Plan may be either incentive stock options or non-qualified options. The 2022 Plan is administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors. The compensation committee has the exclusive power to select individuals to receive grants, to establish the terms of the options granted to each participant, provided that all options granted shall be granted at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the common stock covered by the option on the grant date, and to make all determinations necessary or advisable under the 2022 Plan. On February 9, 2022, the board of directors approved a grant of 50,000 stock options each to six members of management subject to the approval of the 2022 Plan.\nStock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2022, which is included in corporate segment selling, general and administrative expenses, amounted to $2.4 million with related tax benefit amounting to $569,000. No stock-based compensation was recognized during fiscal 2021 and 2020. As of September 30, 2022, we had unrecognized compensation cost amounting to $7.1 million related to stock-based compensation awards granted, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 4.4 years.\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n13. Stock-based Compensation - continued\nThe February 9, 2022 stock options vest over four years with the first 20% having vested on the approval of the 2022 Plan at the 2022 annual stockholders' meeting on August 23, 2022, and 20% vesting on February 9 of each year thereafter, provided however that the options will be subject to earlier vesting under certain events set forth in the Plan, including without limitation a change in control. All of the options will expire, if not vested, at the end of five years. The weighted average grant-date fair value of the stock options was $31.37. No stock options were exercised in fiscal 2022.\nThe following table summarizes information about stock option activity under the 2022 Plan:\nNumber of Shares Weighted-Average Exercise Price Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands)\nOutstanding at September 30, 2021 -\nGranted 300,000 $ 100.00\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022 300,000 $ 100.00 4.4 $ -\nExercisable at September 30, 2022 60,000 $ 100.00 4.4 $ -\n14. Employee Retirement Plan\nThe Company sponsors a Simple IRA plan (the Plan), which covers all of the Companys corporate employees. The Plan allows corporate employees to contribute up to the maximum amount allowed by law, with the Company making a matching contribution of up to 3% of the employees salary. Expenses related to matching contributions to the Plan approximated $258,000, $209,000, and $171,000 for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n15. Insurance Recoveries\nOne of our clubs in Washington Park, Illinois was temporarily closed due to a fire during the third quarter of 2019, and another club in Fort Worth, Texas sustained weather-related damage toward the end of fiscal 2019. Both of these casualties received insurance recoveries in subsequent fiscal years. During the fourth quarter of 2021, one club in Sulphur, Louisiana incurred damage from a hurricane. We wrote off the net carrying value of the assets destroyed in the said events and recorded corresponding recovery of losses or gains in as much as the insurers have paid us or where contingencies relating to the insurance claims have been resolved.\nIn relation to these casualty events, we recorded the following in our consolidated financial statements (in thousands):\nIncluded in 2022 2021 2020\nConsolidated balance sheets (period end)\nInsurance receivable Account receivable, net $ - $ 186 $ 191\nConsolidated statements of operations - loss (gain)\nBusiness interruption Other charges, net $ - $ - $ (176)\nProperty Other charges, net $ (463) $ (1,337) $ 596\nConsolidated statements of cash flows\nProceeds from business interruption insurance claims Operating activity $ - $ 106 $ 384\nProceeds from property insurance claims Investing activity $ 648 $ 1,152 $ 945\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n15.

Net gain on the transaction was $583,000 after closing costs. The net proceeds of $1.4 million were used to pay down related debt.\nOn August 6, 2020, the Company sold another corporate housing property for $176,000 in cash with an approximate gain of $26,000. The net proceeds of $160,500 were used to pay down related debt.\n2021 Acquisitions\nOn December 28, 2020, the Company acquired the real estate and other business assets of a club in Centreville, Illinois for $500,000 in cash. The Company is leasing out this property to a club operator for $48,000 annually.\nOn January 26, 2021, the Company acquired land for a future Bombshells location in Arlington, Texas for $2.9 million. The Company paid approximately $754,000 in cash including closing costs and financed $2.175 million with a bank lender for a 20-year promissory note with an initial interest rate of 3.99% per annum. See Note 9.\nOn March 10, 2021, the Company acquired approximately 57,000-square foot of land across the street from our corporate office for $475,000 in cash. The Company plans to build a warehouse on that land.\nOn March 22, 2021, the Company acquired land adjacent to a Bombshells location in Houston, Texas for $1.04 million in cash.\nOn April 7, 2021, the Company acquired land near our Bombshells location in Pearland, Texas for $1.275 million in cash.\n2021 Dispositions\nOn May 7, 2021, the Company sold one of the properties held for sale for $3.1 million. The property had a carrying value of $2.3 million. We recorded a net gain of approximately $657,000 after closing costs and we paid related debt amounting to $2.0 million from the proceeds of the sale. See Note 7.\nOn September 21, 2021, the Company sold land where a club used to be operated for $2.25 million with a net gain of approximately $54,000 after closing costs. We paid $1.2 million of related debt with the proceeds of the sale.\n2022 Acquisitions\nOn October 18, 2021, we and certain of our subsidiaries completed our acquisition of eleven gentlemens clubs, six related real estate properties, and associated intellectual property for a total agreed acquisition price of $88.0 million (with a total consideration preliminary fair value of $87.9 million based on the Companys stock price at acquisition date and discounted due to the lock-up period, with interest rates on promissory notes reflective of market yields). We used the Finnerty Model to estimate the discount on stock marketability. The acquisition was structured by entering into nine asset purchase agreements, which allowed the Company to acquire from each club all of the tangible and intangible assets and personal property in that business except certain excluded assets, and two stock purchase agreements, where a newly formed subsidiary purchased 100% of the capital stock of two club-owning entities. Along with the asset and stock purchase agreements, the Company also entered into a real estate purchase and sale agreement for six real estate properties,\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n16. Acquisitions and Dispositions - continued\nand an intellectual property purchase agreement for substantially all of the intellectual property used in the adult entertainment establishment business owned and operated by the sellers. The acquisition gives the Company presence in four additional states. We paid for the acquisition with $36.8 million in cash, $21.2 million in four seller-financed notes (see Note 9), and 500,000 shares of our common stock.\nThe preliminary fair value of the consideration transferred is as follows (in thousands):\nCash $ 36,800\nNotes payable 21,200\nCommon stock 29,933\nTotal consideration fair value $ 87,933\nWe recognized the assets and liabilities for this acquisition based on our estimates of their acquisition date fair values, all in our Nightclubs reportable segment. We have not finalized our valuation of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in this transaction. As of the release of this report, the fair value of the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets are provisional pending receipt of the final valuations for those assets. Based on the allocation of the preliminary fair value of the acquisition price, measurement period adjustments, and subject to any working capital adjustments, the amount of goodwill is estimated at $15.4 million. Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price fair value over the fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which is essentially the forward earnings potential of the acquired entities. Goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested at least annually for impairment. Approximately $7.1 million of the recognized goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes.\nThe following is our preliminary allocation of the fair value of the acquisition price (in thousands) as of October 18, 2021:\nCurrent assets $ 386\nProperty and equipment 19,273\nLicenses 47,390\nTradenames 6,934\nLeases acquired in-place 261\nDeferred tax liability (1,741)\nTotal net assets acquired 72,503\nGoodwill 15,430\nAcquisition price fair value $ 87,933\nLicenses and tradenames, except for those associated with certain leased locations, will not be amortized but will be tested at least annually for impairment.\nThe Company entered into leases with third parties for certain acquired clubs where the real estate was not part of the acquisition. See Note 20.\nIn connection with this acquisition, we incurred acquisition-related expenses of approximately $414,000, of which $173,000 was recognized in fiscal 2021 and $241,000 was recognized in fiscal 2022, and in both periods included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. We recorded $1.8 million in measurement period adjustments related to amortization of definite-lived intangibles and debt discount during fiscal 2022.\nFrom the date of acquisition until September 30, 2022, the eleven acquired clubs contributed revenues of $35.4 million and income from operations of $12.5 million, which are included in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2022. The following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of operations of the Company\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n16. Acquisitions and Dispositions - continued\nand the eleven acquired clubs and related assets as though the acquisition occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2021 (in thousands, except per share amount and number of shares):\n2022 2021\nPro forma revenues $ 269,347 $ 217,996\nPro forma net income attributable to RCIHH common stockholders $ 45,623 $ 25,290\nPro forma earnings per share - basic and diluted $ 4.86 $ 2.66\nPro forma weighted average number of common shares outstanding - basic and diluted 9,383,445 9,504,744\nThe above unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2021. The unaudited pro forma financial information reflects material, nonrecurring adjustments directly attributable to the acquisition including acquisition-related expenses, interest expense, and any related tax effects. Since we do not have a final valuation of the assets that we acquired yet, the unaudited pro forma financial information only includes preliminary adjustments related to changes in recognized expenses caused by the fair value of assets acquired, such as depreciation and amortization and related tax effects. Pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share include the impact of acquisition-related expenses and interest expense related to the 28 private lender group notes and 4 seller-financed notes in the acquisition as if they were incurred as of the first day of fiscal 2021. Pro forma weighted average number of common shares outstanding includes the impact of 500,000 shares of our common stock issued as partial consideration for the acquisition.\nOn November 8, 2021, the Company acquired a club and related real estate in Newburgh, New York for a total preliminary purchase price of $3.5 million, of which $2.5 million was paid in cash at closing and $1.0 million through a seller-financed 7-year promissory note with an interest rate of 4.0% per annum. The $3.5 million acquisition price is preliminarily allocated $2.1 million to real estate, $200,000 to tangible assets, and $1.2 million to goodwill, which is deductible for tax purposes. The note is payable $13,669 per month, including principal and interest. See Note 9. The Company incurred approximately $21,000 of acquisition-related costs for this acquisition, of which $11,000 was incurred in fiscal 2021 and $10,000 was incurred in fiscal 2022, both of which were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. From the date of acquisition until September 30, 2022, the acquired club contributed revenues of $1.6 million and income from operations of $276,000, which are included in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2022. The Company is not providing supplemental pro forma disclosures to this acquisition as it does not materially contribute to the consolidated operations of the Company.\nOn December 30, 2021, the Company acquired the real estate of one of its clubs in South Florida, which the Company previously leased, for $7.0 million in an all-cash purchase. At closing, the Company wrote off the balance of its operating lease right-of-use assets and corresponding operating lease liability related to the discontinued lease, both of which amounted to $5.9 million.\nOn March 1, 2022, the Company acquired real estate in Stafford, Texas for $3.5 million for a future Bombshells location. The Company secured a $2.6 million loan in relation to the purchase. See Note 9.\nOn March 1, 2022, the Company acquired real estate in Lubbock, Texas for $400,000 to move one of our existing clubs due to eminent domain on the current location. See 2023 Disposition below.\nOn May 2, 2022, the Company completed an acquisition of a club in Miami, Florida for a total acquisition price of $16.0 million. The acquisition price includes $3.0 million for the real estate property covered in a stock purchase agreement payable in cash at closing, and $13.0 million for the adult entertainment business covered in a separate stock purchase agreement payable as follows: (1) $2.0 million in cash at closing; (2) $6.0 million under a 10% three-year promissory note payable in 35 equal monthly payments of $79,290 in principal and interest based on a ten-year amortization schedule, with a balloon payment for the remaining principal plus accrued interest due at maturity; and (3) $5.0 million under a 10% ten-year interest-only promissory note payable in 119 equal monthly payments of $41,667 in interest, with a balloon payment of the total $5.0 million in principal plus accrued interest due at maturity. The Company\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n16. Acquisitions and Dispositions - continued\nacquired 100% of the capital stock of the acquired companies in each of the stock purchase agreements mentioned above. The $5.0 million promissory note may be earlier canceled if there are any regulatory changes that would prohibit the business from operating as an adult entertainment establishment within ten years of the closing date of the stock purchase agreement. Based on recent renewals of licenses of similar businesses in the region where the club operates, the Company believes that the probability of any changes to the regulatory environment is low as of the reporting date and would not materially impact the fair value of the debt.\nWe recognized the assets and liabilities for this acquisition based on our estimates of their acquisition date fair values, all in our Nightclubs reportable segment. We have not finalized our valuation of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in this transaction. As of the release of this report, the fair value of the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and the fair value of the contingent debt consideration are provisional pending receipt of the final valuations for those items. Based on the allocation of the preliminary fair value of the acquisition price, measurement period adjustments, and subject to any working capital adjustments, the amount of goodwill is estimated to be $6.8 million. Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price fair value over the fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which is essentially the forward earnings potential of the acquired entities. Goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested at least annually for impairment. The recognized goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes.\nThe following is our preliminary allocation of the fair value of the acquisition price (in thousands) as of May 2, 2022:\nCurrent assets $ 172\nProperty and equipment 5,336\nLicenses 4,900\nTradenames 1,460\nDeferred tax liability (2,627)\nTotal net assets acquired 9,241\nGoodwill 6,759\nAcquisition price fair value $ 16,000\nLicenses and tradenames will not be amortized but will be tested at least annually for impairment.\nIn connection with the acquisition, we incurred acquisition-related expenses of approximately $28,000, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nFrom the date of acquisition until September 30, 2022, the acquired club contributed revenues of $2.8 million and income from operations of $1.4 million, which are included in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2022. The seller has not maintained historical U.S. GAAP financial data and it is impracticable to prepare them, therefore, we could not provide supplemental pro forma information of the combined entities.\nOn May 23, 2022, the Company acquired real estate in Rowlett, Texas for $3.3 million for a future Bombshells location. The Company secured a $2.2 million loan in relation to the purchase. See Note 9.\nOn July 21, 2022, the Company acquired a club in Odessa, Texas for a total acquisition price of $1.8 million, of which $1.0 million was for the real estate and $800,000 for the adult entertainment business. The Company paid $1.0 million in cash at closing for the real estate and executed an $800,000 6% seller-financed promissory note for the business. The promissory note matures in seven years and is payable in 84 equal monthly installments of $11,687 of principal and interest. See Note 9. The $1.8 million acquisition price is preliminarily allocated $11,000 to current assets, $1.1 million to property and equipment, and $684,000 to licenses. From the date of acquisition until September 30, 2022, the acquired club contributed very minimal revenues and income from operations. The Company is not providing supplemental pro forma disclosures to this acquisition as it does not materially contribute to the consolidated operations of the Company.\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n16. Acquisitions and Dispositions - continued\nOn July 27, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of a club in Hallandale Beach, Florida for a total acquisition price of $25.0 million.

We have not finalized our valuation of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in this transaction. As of the release of this report, the fair value of the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and the fair value of the contingent debt consideration are provisional pending receipt of the final valuations for those items. Based on the allocation of the preliminary fair value of the acquisition price, measurement period adjustments, and subject to any working capital adjustments, the amount of goodwill is estimated to be $5.6 million. Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price fair value over the fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which is essentially the forward earnings potential of the acquired entities.

Net income attributable to RCIHH stockholders and earnings per share were impacted by $1.9 million in asset impairments ($1.7 million in the third quarter and $166,000 in the fourth quarter) and $2.4 million gain on sale or disposition of businesses and assets ($342,000 in the first quarter, $58,000 in the second quarter, $266,000 in the third quarter, and $1.7 million in the fourth quarter). Quarterly effective income tax expense rate was 21.7%, 23.4%, 21.3%, and 27.1% from first to fourth quarter, respectively, including the impact of the $343,000 deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the fourth quarter.\n(2) Fiscal year 2021 revenues were significantly higher compared to prior year, except for the first quarter, which was still affected by the lockdowns and social restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Net income attributable to RCIHH stockholders and earnings per share were heavily impacted by the gain on debt extinguishment ($4.9 million in the first quarter and $380,000 in the second quarter), asset impairments totaling $13.6 million ($1.4 million in the second quarter, $271,000 in the third quarter, and $11.9 million in the fourth quarter), and gain on insurance totaling $1.3 million ($197,000 in the first quarter, $12,000 in the second quarter, and $1.0 million in the fourth quarter). Quarterly effective income tax expense (benefit) rate was (4.2)%, 24.3%, 24.4%, and (210.4)% from first to fourth quarter, respectively, including the impact of the release of a $462,000 deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the fourth quarter.\n(3) Fiscal year 2020 revenues during the second through the fourth quarter were significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) attributable to RCIHH stockholders, and earnings (loss) per share included the impact of a $10.6 million in asset impairments ($8.2 million in the second quarter, $982,000 in the third quarter, and $1.4 million in the fourth quarter). Net loss attributable to RCIHH stockholders and loss per share during the fourth quarter was also affected by the $1.3 million valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. Quarterly effective income tax expense (benefit) rate was 22.0%, (28.9)%, (20.5)%, and 36.3% from first to fourth quarter, respectively.\nOur nightclub operations are normally affected by seasonal factors. Historically, we have experienced reduced revenues from April through September (our fiscal third and fourth quarters) with the strongest operating results occurring during October through March (our fiscal first and second quarters), but in fiscal 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, revenues during the second through the fourth quarter were significantly reduced. Our revenues in certain markets are also affected by sporting events that cause unusual changes in sales from year to year.\n18. Segment Information\nThe Company owns and operates adult nightclubs and Bombshells Restaurants and Bars. The Company has identified such segments based on management responsibility and the nature of the Companys products, services and costs.

Accordingly, those asset costs have been transferred out of the Bombshells segment.\n19. Related Party Transactions\nPresently, our Chairman and President, Eric Langan, personally guarantees all of the commercial bank indebtedness of the Company. Mr. Langan receives no compensation or other direct financial benefit for any of the guarantees. The balance of our commercial bank indebtedness, net of debt discount and issuance costs, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $115.1 million and $99.7 million, respectively.\nIncluded in the $17.0 million borrowing on October 12, 2021 (see Note 9) are notes borrowed from related parties-one note for $500,000 (Ed Anakar, see above) and another note for $150,000 (from a brother of Company CFO, Bradley Chhay, see above) in which the terms of the notes are the same as the rest of the lender group.\nWe used the services of Nottingham Creations, and previously Sherwood Forest Creations, LLC, both furniture fabrication companies that manufacture tables, chairs and other furnishings for our Bombshells locations, as well as providing ongoing maintenance. Nottingham Creations is owned by a brother of Eric Langan (as was Sherwood Forest). Amounts billed to us for goods and services provided by Nottingham Creations and Sherwood Forest were approximately $207,000 in fiscal 2022, $118,000 in fiscal 2021, and $59,000 in fiscal 2020.

Leases\nThe Company leases certain facilities and equipment under operating leases per ASC 842, which the Company adopted on October 1, 2019. The Companys adoption of ASC 842 included renewal or termination options for varying periods which we deemed reasonably certain to exercise. This determination is based on our consideration of certain economic, strategic and other factors that we evaluate at lease commencement date and reevaluate throughout the lease term.\nSome leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage or may vary for other reasons, such as payments for insurance and tax payments and additional lease payments contingent on sales. The variable portion of lease payments is not included in our right-of-use assets or lease liabilities. Rather, variable payments, other than those dependent upon an index or rate, are expensed when the obligation for those payments is incurred and are included in lease expenses recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations.\nWe have elected to apply the short-term lease exception for all underlying asset classes, which mainly includes equipment leases. That is, leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet, but rather expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We do not include significant restrictions or covenants in our lease agreements, and residual value guarantees are generally not included within our operating leases.\nIncluded in lease expense in our consolidated statements of operations (see Note 5) were lease payments for a house that the Companys CEO rented to the Company for corporate housing for its out-of-town Bombshells management and trainers, of which lease expense totaled $19,500 for the year ended September 30, 2020. This lease terminated on December 31, 2019 and was scoped out upon adoption of ASC 842 on October 1, 2019.\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n20.

Any reduction in total lease expense during the period caused by either an extension of the lease term or a forgiveness of certain lease payments is accounted for as variable lease payment adjustments.\nWe recorded impairment charges of operating lease right-of-use assets amounting to $0, $0, and $104,000 during fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\nSchedule of Valuation and Qualifying Accounts\n(Amounts in Thousands)\nBalance at beginning of year Charged to costs and expenses(1)\nDeductions(2)\nBalance at end of year\nAllowance for doubtful accounts receivable\nFiscal 2020 $ 101 $ 347 $ (187) $ 261\nFiscal 2021 $ 261 $ 215 $ (94) $ 382\nFiscal 2022 $ 382 $ 191 $ (543) $ 30\nAllowance for doubtful notes receivable\nFiscal 2020 $ - $ 602 $ (420) $ 182\nFiscal 2021 $ 182 $ (80) $ - $ 102\nFiscal 2022 $ 102 $ 753 $ (855) $ -\nDeferred tax asset valuation allowance(3)\nFiscal 2020 $ - $ 1,273 $ - $ 1,273\nFiscal 2021 $ 1,273 $ - $ (632) $ 641\nFiscal 2022 $ 641 $ 343 $ - $ 984\n(1) Charged to bad debts expense (under other selling, general and administrative expenses) in the consolidated statements of operations.\n(2) Written off against gross receivable and allowance.\n(3) Included in deferred tax liability, net in the consolidated balance sheets. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nThere have been no disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nIn connection with the preparation of this report, an evaluation was carried out by certain members of Company management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC) Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2022. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and the CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nDue to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below, management concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2022. Notwithstanding the existence of this material weakness, management believes that the consolidated financial statements in this annual report filed on Form 10-K present, in all material respects, the Companys financial condition as reported, in conformity with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP).\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe have identified a material weakness in internal control related to the proper design and implementation of controls over managements review of the Companys accounting for business combinations, specifically related to the identification of and accounting for, intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Based on our evaluation, our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2022.\nThe Companys independent registered public accounting firm, Friedman, LLP, has expressed an adverse opinion on our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, in the audit report that appears at the end of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRemediation Plan for Existing Material Weakness\nManagement is committed to the remediation of the material weakness described above. As such, controls will be added to both increase precision of managements review of each component of business combinations, and if necessary, retain the services of a third-party consultant to assist in the valuation and accounting for intangible assets acquired in a business combination.\nIt is our belief that these added controls will effectively remediate the existing material weakness.\nPreviously Reported Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nAs disclosed in Item 9A Controls and Procedures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we identified a material weakness in internal control related to the proper design and implementation of controls over our estimates relating to the impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets, specifically over the precision of management's review of certain assumptions.\nRemediation Efforts to Address Previous Material Weakness\nIn response to the previously reported material weakness for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, management has developed and implemented enhanced review procedures that are performed by senior management over the precision of managements review of certain assumptions and estimates related to the impairment process as noted above.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed our testing of the operating effectiveness of the implemented controls. The Company has completed the documentation and testing of the corrective actions described above and has concluded that the remediation activities implemented are sufficient to conclude that the previously disclosed material weakness on the proper design and implementation of controls over our estimates relating to the impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets, specifically over the precision of managements review of certain assumptions within the impairment valuation model has been remediated as of September 30, 2022.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company completed several business combinations as described in Note 16. Acquisitions and Dispositions to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn October 18, 2021, we completed our acquisition of eleven gentlemens clubs, six related real estate properties, and associated intellectual property.\nOn November 8, 2021, we acquired a club and related real estate.\nOn May 2, 2022, we completed an acquisition of a club.\nOn July 21, 2022, we acquired a club including real estate and the adult entertainment business.\nOn July 27, 2022, we completed the acquisition of a club for the adult entertainment business and for the real estate property\nThe scope of managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures for fiscal year end 2022 did not include the internal control over the financial reporting of these acquisitions, in accordance with the SECs staff guidance that permits exclusion of acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Due to the size, breadth and complexity of the acquisition of these businesses, managements evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, did exclude those internal control activities. The businesses are wholly owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues are excluded from managements assessment and represent approximately 22% and 15%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nExcept for the remediation efforts as discussed above, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September\n30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information.\nNone\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nRCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc.\nAdverse Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc.s (the Companys) internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described in the following paragraph on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nA material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in managements assessment:\nIneffective controls related to managements review of the Companys accounting for business combinations, specifically related to the identification of and accounting for, intangible assets acquired in a business combination.\nThis material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2022 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated December 14, 2022, on those consolidated financial statements.\nWe do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on managements statements referring to any corrective actions taken by the Company after the date of managements assessment.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows of the Company, and our report dated December 14, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A - Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nAs described in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded the Companys acquisition of five businesses that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2022, from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, as they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during the year ended September 30, 2022. We have also excluded the businesses from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. The businesses are wholly owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues excluded from managements assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent\napproximately 22% and 15%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Friedman LLP\nMarlton, New Jersey\nDecember 14, 2022\nPART III Item 10.

The Audit Committee meets privately with our Chief Financial Officer and with our independent registered public accounting firm and evaluates the responses by the Chief Financial Officer both to the facts presented and to the judgments made by our outside independent registered public accounting firm. Yura Barabash serves as the Audit Committees financial expert.\nIn August 2015, our Board adopted a new Charter for the Audit Committee. A copy of the Audit Committee Charter can be found on our website at www.rcihospitality.com/investor. The Charter establishes the independence of our Audit Committee and sets forth the scope of the Audit Committees duties.

The Audit Committee also reviews our systems, methods and procedures of internal controls in the areas of: financial reporting, audits, treasury operations, corporate finance, managerial, financial and SEC accounting, compliance with law, and ethical conduct. NASDAQ Stock Market Rules require all members of the Audit Committee to be independent. The Audit Committee is objective, and reviews and assesses the work of our independent registered public accounting firm and our internal accounting department.\nNOMINATING COMMITTEE\nWe have a Nominating Committee whose current members are Elaine Martin, Luke Lirot, Yura Barabash and Arthur Allan Priaulx.

Based solely upon a review of Forms 3, 4 and 5 furnished to us during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we believe that the directors, executive officers, and greater than ten percent beneficial owners have complied with all applicable filing requirements during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, except for (i) a Form 4 for a single transaction that was not filed on a timely basis by Yura Barabash, a director, and (ii) two Form 4s for a total of three transactions that were not filed on a timely basis by Elaine Martin, a director.\nCODE OF ETHICS\nWe have adopted a code of ethics for our principal executive and senior financial officers, a copy of which can be found on our website at www.rcihospitality.com. Item 11. Executive Compensation.\nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nThis compensation discussion and analysis describes the material elements of the Companys compensation programs as they relate to our executive officers who are listed in the compensation tables appearing below. This compensation discussion and analysis focuses on the information contained in the following tables and related footnotes. The individuals who served as the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer during fiscal 2022, as well as any other individuals included in the Summary Compensation Table, are referred to as named executive officers.\nOverview of Compensation Committee Role and Responsibilities\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors oversees our compensation plans and policies, reviews and approves all decisions concerning the named executive officers compensation, which may further be approved by the Board, and administers our stock option and equity plans, including reviewing and approving stock option grants and equity awards under the plans. The Compensation Committees membership is determined by the Board and is composed entirely of independent directors.\nManagement plays a role in the compensation-setting process. The most significant aspects of managements role are to evaluate employee performance and recommend salary levels and equity compensation awards. Our Chief Executive Officer often makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee and the Board concerning compensation for other executive officers. Our Chief Executive Officer is a member of the Board but does not participate in Board decisions regarding any aspect of his own compensation. The Compensation Committee can retain independent advisors or consultants.\nCompensation Committee Process\nThe Compensation Committee reviews executive compensation in connection with the evaluation and approval of an employment agreement, an increase in responsibilities or other factors. With respect to equity compensation awarded to other employees, the Compensation Committee or the Board may grant stock options, often after receiving a recommendation from our Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee also evaluates proposals for incentive and performance equity awards, and other compensation.\nCompensation Philosophy\nThe Compensation Committee emphasizes the important link between the Companys performance, which ultimately affects stockholder value, and the compensation of its executives. Therefore, the primary goal of the Companys executive compensation policy is to try to align the interests of the executive officers with the interests of the stockholders. In order to achieve this goal, the Company attempts to (i) offer compensation opportunities that attract and retain executives whose abilities and skills are critical to the long-term success of the Company and reward them for their efforts in ensuring the success of the Company, (ii) align the Companys compensation programs with the Companys long-term business strategies and objectives, and (iii) provide variable compensation opportunities that are directly linked to the Companys performance and stockholder value, including an equity stake in the Company. Our named executive officers compensation utilizes two primary components - base salary and long-term equity compensation - to achieve these goals. Additionally, the Compensation Committee may award discretionary bonuses to certain executives based on the individuals contribution to the achievement of the Companys strategic objectives.\nSetting Executive Compensation\nWe fix executive base compensation at a level we believe enables us to hire and retain individuals in a competitive environment and to reward satisfactory individual performance and a satisfactory level of contribution to our overall business goals. We also take into account the compensation that is paid by companies that we believe to be our competitors and by other companies with which we believe we generally compete for executives.\nIn establishing compensation packages for executive officers, numerous factors are considered, including the particular executives experience, expertise and performance, our companys overall performance and\ncompensation packages available in the marketplace for similar positions. In arriving at amounts for each component of compensation, our Compensation Committee strives to strike an appropriate balance between base compensation and incentive compensation. The Compensation Committee also endeavors to properly allocate between cash and non-cash compensation and between annual and long-term compensation.\nThe Role of Shareholder Say-on-Pay Votes\nAt our annual meeting of shareholders held on August 23, 2022, approximately 94% of the shareholders who voted (including abstentions) on the say-on-pay proposal approved the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in the proxy statement. Although this advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation is non-binding, the Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for named executive officers.\nBase Salary\nThe Company provides executive officers and other employees with base salary to compensate them for services rendered during the fiscal year. Subject to the provisions contained in employment agreements with executive officers concerning base salary amounts, base salaries of the executive officers are established based upon compensation data of comparable companies in our market, the executives job responsibilities, level of experience, individual performance and contribution to the business. We believe it is important for the Company to provide adequate fixed compensation to highly qualified executives in our competitive industry. In making base salary decisions, the Compensation Committee uses its discretion and judgment based upon personal knowledge of industry practice but does not apply any specific formula to determine the base salaries for the executive officers.\nRetirement Savings Plan\nThe Company maintains a retirement savings plan for the benefit of our executives and employees. Our Simple IRA Plan is intended to qualify as a defined contribution arrangement under the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). Participants may elect to defer a percentage of their eligible pretax earnings each year or contribute a fixed amount per pay period up to the maximum contribution permitted by the Code. All participants plan accounts are 100% vested at all times. All assets of our Simple IRA Plan are invested based on participant-directed elections. We make certain matching contributions to the Simple IRA Plan, which are also 100% vested.\nPerquisites and Other Personal Benefits\nThe Companys executive officers participate in the Companys other benefit plans on the same terms as other employees on a non-discriminatory basis. These plans include medical, dental, life and disability insurance. Relocation benefits also are reimbursed and are individually negotiated when they occur. The Company reimburses each executive officer for all reasonable business and other expenses incurred by them in connection with the performance of their duties and obligations. The Company does not provide named executive officers with any significant perquisites or other personal benefits except for personal travel using Company-owned automobiles and/or aircrafts, and housing and living expenses for our former CFO. In September 2019, the board of directors approved an aircraft policy allowing personal use of Company aircrafts as follows: (1) 25 hours per fiscal quarter for our CEO, and (2) 12 hours each per fiscal quarter for other executive officers.\nSUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE\nThe following table reflects all forms of compensation for services to us for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 of our named executive officers.\nName and\nPrincipal Position Year Salary\n($) Bonus\n($) Option\nAwards(1)\n($)\nAll Other\nCompensation(2)\n($)\nTotal\n($)\nEric S.

Information about the assumptions used to value these stock option awards can be found in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(2)All Other Compensation consists of SIMPLE IRA matching contributions, automobile expenses, personal use of aircraft, and housing and living expenses. We account for personal use of aircraft to be the aggregate incremental cost of personal use of the company aircraft as calculated based on a cost-per-flight-hour charge developed by a nationally recognized and independent service. The charge reflects the direct cost of operating the aircraft, including fuel, additives, lubricants, maintenance labor, airframe parts, engine restoration, and major periodic maintenance. We added actual airport/hangar fees charged to the company on a per-flight basis. The charge does not include fixed costs that do not change based on usage, such as aircraft depreciation, home hangar expenses, and general taxes and insurance. We value automobile expenses based on the annual depreciation rate of automobiles assigned for use by the particular officer, plus cost of insurance, registration, repairs, maintenance, tolls, and fuel.

As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported below, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.\nThe compensation for our CEO in fiscal 2022 of $3,419,853 was approximately 135 times the compensation of our fiscal 2022 median employee of $25,294.\nGRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS\nThe following table sets forth information regarding grants of plan-based awards made to our named executive officers during fiscal 2022.\nEstimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards\nName Grant\nDate Threshold\n(#) Target\n(#) Maximum\n(#) All Other\nOption\nAwards(1)\n(#)\nExercise Price\nof Option\nAwards\n($/Sh) Grant Date\nFair Value\nof Option\nAwards\n($)\nEric S.

Langan -\nTravis Reese -\nEMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS\nOn August 25, 2022, we entered into new two-year employment agreements with each of our executive officers, including Eric Langan, our Chief Executive Officer and President; Bradley Chhay, our Chief Financial Officer; and Travis Reese, our Executive Vice President and Secretary. Under their respective new agreements, Mr. Chhays annual salary increased to $465,000; Mr. Reeses annual salary increased to $460,000; and Mr. Langans annual salary remained the same at $1,700,000. The term of each of the agreements commenced on September 1, 2022 and will end on August 31, 2024. Each of the new employment agreements also provides for bonus eligibility, expense reimbursement, health benefits, participation in our benefit plans, use of a company-owned automobile, access to company-owned aircraft (subject to the terms and conditions of our corporate aircraft policy), and two weeks paid vacation annually. Under the terms of the new agreements, each executive is bound to a confidentiality provision and cannot compete with us for a period upon termination of the agreement.\nCurrently, our executive officers do not have long-term incentive plans or defined benefit or actuarial plans outstanding.\nEMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLANS\nOn February 7, 2022, our board of directors approved the 2022 Stock Option Plan (the 2022 Plan). The boards adoption of the 2022 Plan was approved by the shareholders during the annual stockholders' meeting on August 23, 2022. The 2022 Plan provides that the maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock underlying options that may be granted under the 2022 Plan is 300,000. The options granted under the 2022 Plan may be either incentive stock options or non-qualified options. The 2022 Plan is administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors. The compensation committee has the exclusive power to select individuals to receive grants, to establish the terms of the options granted to each participant, provided that all options granted shall be granted at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the common stock covered by the option on the grant date, and to make all determinations necessary or advisable under the 2022 Plan. On February 9, 2022, the board of directors approved a grant of 50,000 stock options each to six members of management subject to the approval of the 2022 Plan.\nCOMPENSATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES AS THEY RELATE TO RISK MANAGEMENT\nWe attempt to make our compensation programs discretionary, balanced and focused on the long term. We believe goals and objectives of our compensation programs reflect a balanced mix of quantitative and qualitative performance measures to avoid excessive weight on a single performance measure. Our approach to compensation practices and policies applicable to employees and consultants is consistent with that followed for our executives. Based on these factors, we believe that our compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.\nCompensation Committee Report\nThe Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis to be included in this Form 10-K. Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Compensation Committee recommends to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis referred to above be included in this report. This report is furnished by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, whose members are:\nElaine Martin\nLuke Lirot\nYura Barabash\nArthur Allan Priaulx\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nThe Compensation Committee is comprised of Ms. Martin and Messrs. Lirot, Barabash, and Priaulx. No interlocking relationship exists between any member of the Compensation Committee and any member of any other companys Board of Directors or compensation committee. Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.\nThe following table sets forth certain information at December 9, 2022, with respect to the beneficial ownership of shares of common stock by (i) each person known to us who owns beneficially more than 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock, (ii) each of our directors, (iii) each of our executive officers and (iv) all of our executive officers and directors as a group. Unless otherwise noted below, the address of each beneficial owner listed in the table is c/o RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc., 10737 Cutten Road, Houston, Texas 77066. We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Except as indicated by the footnotes below, we believe, based on the information furnished to us, that the persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock that they beneficially own, subject to applicable community property laws. Applicable percentage ownership is based on 9,230,225 shares of common stock outstanding at December 9, 2022. Generally, in computing the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deem outstanding shares of common stock subject to stock options or warrants held by that person that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of December 9, 2022 and shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of other securities held by that person that are currently convertible or convertible within 60 days of December 9, 2022; we do not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Beneficial ownership representing less than 1% is denoted with an asterisk (*).\nName/Address Common Stock Percent of Class (1)\nExecutive Officers and Directors\nEric S.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\nPresently, our Chairman and President, Eric Langan, personally guarantees all of the commercial bank indebtedness of the company. Mr. Langan receives no compensation or other direct financial benefit for any of the guarantees. Two adult children of Mr. Langan are also employed by the Company in corporate shared services.

Their promissory notes bear interest at the rate of 12% per annum and mature in October 2024. The notes are payable in monthly installments of interest only with a balloon payment of all unpaid principal and interest due at maturity. The terms of the notes are the same as the rest of the lender group.\nWe paid Ed Anakar, our director of operations - club division, employment compensation of $720,492, $655,289, and $502,404 during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nWe used the services of Nottingham Creations, and previously Sherwood Forest Creations, LLC, both furniture fabrication companies that manufacture tables, chairs and other furnishings for our Bombshells locations, as well as providing ongoing maintenance. Nottingham Creations is owned by a brother of Eric Langan (as was Sherwood Forest). Amounts billed to us for goods and services provided by Nottingham Creations and Sherwood Forest were approximately $207,000 in fiscal 2022, $118,000 in fiscal 2021, and $59,000 in fiscal 2020. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, we owed Nottingham Creations and Sherwood Forest $92,808 and $12,205, respectively, in unpaid billings.\nTW Mechanical LLC (TW Mechanical) provided plumbing and HVAC services to both a third-party general contractor providing construction services to the Company, as well as directly to the Company during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020. A son-in-law of Eric Langan owns a 50% interest in TW Mechanical.

The policy provides that prior to the entry into any transaction between the Company and one of its officers, directors, 5% shareholders or an immediate family member of any of the foregoing (a related party), such transaction will be reported to the Companys chief compliance officer. The Companys chief compliance officer will undertake an evaluation of the transaction. If that evaluation indicates that the transaction would require the Audit Committees approval, the Companys chief compliance officer will report this transaction to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will review the material facts of all related party transactions that require the Audit Committees approval and either approve or disapprove of the entry into the related party transaction. If advance Audit Committee approval of a related party transaction is not feasible, then the related party transaction will be considered and, if the Audit Committee determines it to be appropriate, ratified at the Audit Committees next regularly scheduled meeting. In determining whether to approve or ratify a related party transaction, the Audit Committee will take into account factors it deems appropriate. In the event that the Audit Committee determines not to ratify and approve the related party transaction, then the Audit Committee will instruct that the related party transaction be rescinded or unwound. The Audit Committee will not approve or ratify any related party transaction unless it deems that the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related partys interest in the transaction. No director will participate in any discussion or approval of a related party transaction for which he or she is a related party, except that the director shall provide all material information concerning the transaction to the Audit Committee.\nIn reviewing related party transactions under the policy, the Audit Committee will review and consider one or more of the following as it seems appropriate for the circumstances: (1) the related partys interest in the related party transaction; (2) the approximate dollar value of the amount involved in the related party transaction; (3) the approximate dollar value of the amount of the related partys interest in the transaction without regard to the amount of any profit or loss; (4) whether the transaction was undertaken in the ordinary course of business of the Company; (5) whether the transaction with the related party is proposed to be, or was, entered into on terms no less favorable to the Company than terms that could have been reached with an unrelated third party; (6) the purpose of, and the potential benefits to the Company of, the related party transaction; (7) whether the related party transaction would impair the independence of an outside director; (8) required public disclosure, if any; and (9) any other information regarding the related party transaction or the related party in the context of the proposed transaction that would be material to investors in light of the circumstances of the particular transaction. The Audit Committee will review all relevant information available to it about the related party transaction. The Audit Committee may approve or ratify the related party transaction only if the Audit Committee determines in good faith that, under all of the circumstances, the transaction is fair as to the Company. The Audit Committee, in its sole discretion, may impose such condition as it deems appropriate on the Company or the related party in connection with approval of the related party transaction.\nOur Audit Committee is composed of all independent directors, including Yura Barabash, Elaine Martin and Arthur Allan Priaulx. We additionally have one other independent director, Luke Lirot, who is not on the Audit Committee. The definition of independent used herein is based on the independence standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. Item 14.
