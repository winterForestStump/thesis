    "content": "ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nIncorporation and Early History\nWe were incorporated in the State of Idaho in August 1968 under the name Silver Crystal Mines, Inc., to engage in the business of exploring for precious metal deposits and advancing them toward production. We ceased exploration activities during the 1990s and became virtually inactive. In December 2003, a group of investors purchased 80-percent of the issued and outstanding common stock from the then-controlling management team. In January 2004, we affected a one-for-four reverse split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock and increased the number of our authorized shares of common stock to 100,000,000 with a par value of $0.001.\nIn February 2004, our name was changed to Timberline Resources Corporation. Since the reorganization, we have been in an exploration stage evaluating, acquiring, and exploring mineral prospects with potential for economic deposits of precious and base metals. We define a prospect as a mining property, the value of which has not been determined by exploration. In August 2008, we reincorporated into the State of Delaware pursuant to a merger agreement approved by our shareholders.\nIn July 2007, we closed our purchase of the Butte Highlands Gold Project. In October 2008, we announced that we had agreed to form a 50/50 joint venture at the Butte Highlands Project. In July 2009, we finalized the joint venture agreement with Highland Mining, LLC (Highland) to create Butte Highlands JV, LLC (BHJV). Under terms of the joint venture agreement, development began in the summer of 2009, with Highland funding all mine development costs through development. Both Timberlines and Highlands 50-percent share of costs were to be paid out of net proceeds from future mine production. On January 29, 2016, we executed a Member Interest Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with New Jersey Mining Company pursuant to which we sold all of our 50% interest in BHJV.\nIn June 2010, we closed our acquisition of Staccato Gold Resources Ltd. (Staccato Gold), a Canadian-based resource company that was in the business of acquiring, exploring, and developing mineral properties with a focus on gold exploration in the dominant gold producing trends in Nevada. As a result of this acquisition, we obtained Staccatos flagship gold exploration project (Lookout Mountain), and several other projects at various stages of exploration in the Battle Mountain/Eureka gold trend in north-central Nevada, along with Staccato Golds wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, BH Minerals USA, Inc. (BH Minerals).\nIn August 2014, we closed our acquisition of Wolfpack Gold (Nevada) Corp. (Wolfpack US), a U.S. company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wolfpack Gold Corp., a Canadian-based resource company (Wolfpack Gold), that was in the business of acquiring, exploring, and developing mineral properties with a focus on gold exploration in the dominant gold producing trends in Nevada. As a result of this acquisition, we obtained cash and several projects at various stages of exploration in the gold trends in Nevada.\nOn March 17, 2015 Timberline signed a definitive option agreement to purchase 100% ownership in the Talapoosa Project in Nevada from Gunpoint Exploration Ltd. (Gunpoint). The Talapoosa Project is located in western Nevada and contains a resource of over 1 million ounces of gold. Under terms of the agreement Timberline paid Gunpoint $300,000 in cash and 2,000,000 shares of common stock on signing the agreement and was required to pay $10,000,000 (Option Payment) within 30 months of the agreement date to acquire 100% ownership, subject to significant contingent payments if the price of gold traded above US $1,600 per ounce for extended periods in the five (5) ensuing years. On October 26, 2016, the agreement was amended to extend the option exercise period to March 31, 2019 with the following schedule: payment of $1,000,000 and 1,000,000 common shares of the Company by March 31, 2017, payment of $2,000,000 and 1,000,000 common shares by March 31, 2018, and a final payment of $8,000,000 and 1.5 million common shares by March 31, 2019. Timberline chose to not make the required payment due on March 31, 2018, and, therefore, the Agreement was terminated, resulting in a $3.2 million write off of a loss on abandonment of mineral rights.\nIn May 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ownership interests in two joint venture agreements in Nevada from Americas Gold Exploration, Inc (AGEI). The acquisition included a 73.7% interest in the Paiute property joint venture with Nevada Gold Mines LLC (Nevada Gold), and the opportunity to earn up to 65% ownership in the Elder Creek joint venture with McEwen Mining, Inc. The acquisition of the two joint venture ownership interests, at Elder Creek with McEwen Mining and at Paiute with Nevada Gold, from AGEI closed on August 14, 2018 for consideration of ten million shares of our common stock and five million warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. An additional five million warrants with the same terms were issued to AGEI contingent upon certain achievements. Upon closing, we became the operator at both of these joint venture projects. Timberline elected to return control and ownership of the Elder Creek property to McEwen Mining in July of 2020.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2019, the Company recognized an abandonment expense of $48,500 relating to two patented mining claims at in the New York Canyon area of the Eureka property on which the Company had ceased making advance royalty payments.\nOn June 28, 2019, we entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement (the LLC and the LLC Agreement) with PM & Gold Mines, Inc. (PM&G) for the advanced exploration, and if determined feasible, the development of the Lookout Mountain Gold Project, a significant portion of the Companys broader Eureka property located on the southern end of the Battle Mountain-Eureka Trend near Eureka, Nevada. PM&G was a private firm incorporated in Nevada with an interest to explore and advance gold projects to production. The LLC Agreement called for PM&G to fund exploration and development activities in two stages for earned equity in the project. Timberline was to contribute certain claims that constituted the Lookout Mountain Project and adjacent historical Oswego Mine area to the LLC in exchange for its ownership position.\nConcurrent with completion of the LLC Agreement, PM&G also participated in a private placement and acquired 3,367,441 shares, or 4.99%, of our common shares. The placement included the right of PM&G to maintain its position in Timberline by pro-rata participation in future financings. The initial interests in the LLC were 51% PM&G and 49% Timberline, subject to PM&Gs contribution to the LLC in the form of an earn-in. Timberline would manage the project through at least the initial stage of investment, at which time PM&G would have been vested at 51% ownership. PM&G retained the right to manage all subsequent activities with or without Timberlines participation.\nUnder terms of the LLC Agreement, PM&G committed to $3,000,000 of work expenditure during each of the first two years following the agreement effective date of June 28, 2019. PM&G committed $755,605 towards the first-year obligation due on June 28, 2020, but failed to deliver sufficient capital to meet the required first year investment. Under the terms of the agreement, after written notice and a 30-day cure period, PM&G did not cure the matter and thereby resigned from the LLC Agreement giving up all claims and rights to the property.\nOverview of Our Mineral Exploration Business\nWe are a mineral exploration business and, if and when we establish mineral reserves, a development company. Mineral exploration is essentially a research activity that does not produce a product. Successful exploration often results in increased project value that can be realized through the optioning or selling of the claimed site to larger companies. We acquire properties which we believe have potential to host economic concentrations of minerals, particularly gold and silver. These acquisitions have and may take the form of unpatented mining claims on federal land, or leasing claims on private property owned by others. An unpatented mining claim is an interest that can be acquired in the mineral rights on open lands of the federally-owned public domain. Claims are staked in accordance with the Mining Law of 1872, recorded with the federal government pursuant to laws and regulations established by the Bureau of Land Management (the Federal agency that administers Americas public lands), that grant the holder of the claim a possessory interest in the mineral rights, subject to the paramount title of the United States.\nWe perform geological work to identify specific drill targets on the properties, and then collect subsurface samples by drilling to confirm the presence of mineralization (the presence of economic minerals in a specific area or geological formation). We may enter into option and joint venture agreements with other companies to fund further exploration and/or development work. It is our plan to focus on assembling a high-quality group of gold and silver exploration prospects using the experience and contacts of the management group. By such prospects, we mean properties that may have been previously identified by third parties, including prior owners such as exploration companies, as mineral prospects with potential for economic mineralization. Often these properties have been sampled, mapped and sometimes drilled, usually with indefinite results. Accordingly, such acquired projects will either have some prior exploration history or will have strong similarity to a recognized geologic ore deposit model. We place geographic emphasis on the western United States, and Nevada in particular.\nThe focus of our activity has been to acquire properties that we believe to be undervalued, including those that we believe to hold previously unrecognized mineral potential. Properties have been acquired through the location of unpatented mining claims (which allow the claimholder the right to mine the minerals without holding title to the property), or by negotiating lease/option agreements. Our President and CEO, Patrick Highsmith, our Vice President Exploration, Dr. Steven Osterberg, and our CFO, Ted Sharp, as well as our Directors, have experience in evaluating, staking and filing unpatented mining claims, and in negotiating and preparing transactional agreements in connection with those mining claims, including option and JV or mineral lease agreements.\nThe geologic potential and ore deposit models have been defined and specific drill targets identified on the majority of our properties. Our property evaluation process involves using geologic fieldwork to perform an initial evaluation of a property. If the evaluation is positive, we seek to acquire it, either by staking unpatented mining claims on open public domain, or by leasing or optioning the property from the owner of private property or the owner of unpatented claims. Once acquired, we then typically make a more detailed evaluation of the property. This detailed evaluation involves expenditures for exploration work which may include rock and soil sampling, geologic mapping, geophysics, trenching, drilling, or other means to determine if economic mineralization is present on the property.\nPortions of our mineral properties at September 30, 2022 are owned by third parties and leased to us, or carry a financial commitment from us, as outlined in the following table:\nProperty Name\nThird Party\nNumber of\nClaims\nArea\nAgreements/\nRoyalties\nLookout Mountain (Eureka)\nRocky Canyon Mining Company\n6,368 acres\n3.5% NSR + 1.5% NSR capped at $1.5 million (excludes Trevor and Dave claims); 20-year lease term commencing June 1, 2008; annual advanced royalty payment of $72,000.\nSilverado\nSilver International\n1% NSR + $10,000 Annual lease payment\nSeven Troughs\nSlash, Inc.\n4,030\n2% NSR; 50-year lease term commencing December 31, 1975; no annual lease payments;\nPaiute (ICBM JV with LAC Minerals)\nNevada Gold Mines by assignment from LAC Minerals (USA) LLC\n1,343 acres\nICBM Joint Venture Earn-in; 60% ownership for $300,000 work commitment with standard dilution thereafter; historical expenditures by ICBM and Timberline combined bring current Timberline ownership to 76.1%.\nIn the case of properties deemed to be of higher risk due to higher cost exploration or those that host commodities of lesser interest to Timberline (such as base metals), we may choose to present them to larger companies for strategic partnerships. Our strategy is intended to maximize the abilities and skills of the management group, conserve capital, and provide superior leverage for investors.\nFor our gold and silver prospects where drilling costs are reasonable and the likelihood of success seems favorable, we will undertake our own drilling. The target depths, the tenor of mineralization on the surface, and the general geology of the area are all factors that determine the risk as calculated by us in conducting a drilling operation. Mineral exploration is a research and development activity and is, by definition, a high-risk business that relies on numerous untested assumptions and variables. Accordingly, we make our decisions on a project-by-project basis. We do not have any steadfast formula that we apply in determining the reasonableness of drilling costs in comparison to the likelihood of success, i.e., in determining whether the probability of success seems favorable.\nOur Competition\nThe mineral exploration industry is intensely competitive in all phases. In our mineral exploration activities, we compete with many companies possessing greater financial resources and technical facilities than we do for the acquisition of mineral concessions, claims, leases, and other mineral interests as well as for the recruitment and retention of qualified employees, including mining engineers, geologists, and other skilled mining professionals. We use consultants and compete with other mining companies for the man hours of consulting time required to complete our studies. We also compete with other mining companies for exploration and development equipment and services. We must overcome significant barriers to enter into the business of mineral exploration as a result of our limited operating history.\nWe cannot assure the reader that we will be able to compete in any of our business areas effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures faced by us will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur Offices and Other Facilities\nWe currently maintain our administrative office at 101 East Lakeside Ave., Coeur dAlene, ID 83814. The telephone number is (866) 513-4859 (toll free) or (208) 664-4859. We also maintain warehouse space in Eureka, NV 89316.\nOur Employees\nWe are an exploration company and currently have three employees. Management engages independent consultants under contract arrangements as necessary to execute on company strategies at the current early exploration stage of our work and expects to hire staff and additional management as necessary for implementation of our business plan.\nRegulation\nThe exploration and mining industries operate in a legal environment that requires permits to conduct virtually all operations. These permits are required by local, state, and federal government agencies. Federal agencies that may be involved include: the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), and the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Individual states also have various environmental regulatory bodies, such as Departments of Ecology. Local authorities, usually counties, also have control over mining activity. The various permits address such issues as prospecting, development, production, labor standards, taxes, occupational health and safety, toxic substances, air quality, water use, water discharge, water quality, noise, dust, wildlife impacts, as well as other environmental and socioeconomic issues.\nPrior to receiving the necessary permits to explore or mine, a mine operator must comply with all regulatory requirements imposed by all governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the project area. Very often, in order to obtain the requisite permits, the operator must have its land reclamation, restoration, or replacement plans pre-approved. Specifically, the operator must present its plan as to how it intends to restore or replace the affected area. Often all or any of these requirements can cause delays or involve costly studies or alterations of the proposed activity or time frame of operations, in order to mitigate impacts. All of these factors make it more difficult and costlier to operate and have a negative and sometimes fatal impact on the viability of the exploration or mining operation. Finally, it is possible that future changes in these laws or regulations could have a significant impact on our business, causing those activities to be economically re-evaluated at that time. For a more detailed discussion of governmental and environmental regulatory requirements applicable to our mineral exploration business see the section titled Description of Properties - Overview of Regulatory, Economic and Environmental Issues below.\nReclamation\nWe generally are required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts of prospecting and drilling activities, which are normally minor but may require contouring, re-sloping and re-vegetating roads and drill sites. Similarly, the greater impacts of mining and mineral processing operations must also be mitigated by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and re-vegetating various portions of a site after operations are completed. These reclamation efforts are conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies, and may require us to remit cash to pay for reclamation bonds. Should we cease operations without performing the required reclamation, these bonds would cover the cost of reclamation activities to be performed by the regulatory agency.\nThe Commodities Market\nThe prices of gold and silver have fluctuated during the last several years, with the prices of gold and silver falling to their lowest levels in the past several years in 2015 and early 2016, before rebounding. In 2017, gold traded between approximately $1,151 and $1,346 per ounce. In 2018, gold traded between approximately $1,175 and $1,355 per ounce. In 2019, gold traded between approximately $1,270 and $1,547 per ounce. In 2020, gold traded between approximately $1,474 and $2,067 per ounce. In 2021, gold traded between $1,683 and $1,943 per ounce. The price of gold was $2,039 per ounce in March 2022, but traded considerably lower during the year, reaching as low as $1,634 per ounce in September 2022, before rising back up to approximately $1,816 at the time of this writing. All of these gold prices are based on the London PM Fix Price per troy ounce of gold in U.S. dollars.\nIn 2017, silver traded between approximately $15.22 and $18.56 per ounce. In 2018, silver traded between approximately $13.97 and $17.52 per ounce. In 2019, silver traded between approximately $14.38 and $19.42 per ounce. In 2020, silver traded between approximately $12.01 and $28.89 per ounce. In 2021, silver traded between $21.52 and $29.58. The price of silver was $26.17 in March 2022 and continued to drop to a low of $17.77 per ounce in September 2022, before settling at approximately $24 at the time of this writing. All of these silver prices are based on the London Fix Price per troy ounce of silver in U.S. dollars.\nSeasonality\nSeasonality in Nevada is not a material factor to our operations. Certain surface exploration work may need to be conducted when there is no snow on the ground, but it is not a material issue. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in an exploration stage mining company such as ours involves an unusually high degree of risk, known and unknown, present and potential, including, but not limited to the risks enumerated below.\nFailure to successfully address the risks and uncertainties described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock may decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment. We cannot assure you that we will successfully address these risks or other unknown risks that may affect our business.\nEstimates of mineralized material are forward-looking statements inherently subject to error. Although mineralization and reserve estimates require a high degree of assurance in the underlying data when the estimates are made, unforeseen events and uncontrollable factors can have significant adverse or positive impacts on the estimates. Actual results will inherently differ from estimates. The unforeseen events and uncontrollable factors include: geologic uncertainties including inherent sample variability, metal price fluctuations, variations in mining and processing parameters, and adverse changes in environmental or mining laws and regulations. We cannot accurately predict the timing and effects of variances from estimated values.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nOur ability to operate as a going concern is in doubt.\nThe audit opinion and notes that accompany our consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022, disclose a \u2018going concern qualification to our ability to continue in business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. We have incurred losses since our inception. We have sufficient cash to fund normal operations and meet all of our obligations for the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2022, we have working capital of approximately $1.4 million. However, we are an exploration company with exploration programs that require significant cash expenditures. A significant drilling program, such are those we have planned, can result in depletion of cash and return us to a position of insufficient cash to support normal operations for 12 months.\nFull disclosure of the going concern qualification appears in Part II, Item 7 - Financial Condition and Liquidity, and also in the notes to the financial statements (See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.)\nWe have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects.\nAlthough we have been in the business of exploring mineral properties since our incorporation in 1968, we were inactive for many years prior to our new management in 2004. Since 2004, we have not yet established any mineral reserves. As a result, we have not had any revenues from our exploration activities. While we have had a wholly-owned drilling services subsidiary which has generated revenues in past fiscal years, we no longer own that business. In addition, our operating history has been restricted to the acquisition and exploration of our mineral properties, and this does not provide a meaningful basis for an evaluation of our prospects if we ever determine that we have a mineral reserve and commence the construction and operation of a mine. Other than through conventional and typical exploration methods and procedures, we have no additional way to evaluate the likelihood of whether our mineral properties contain any mineral reserves or, if they do that they will be operated successfully. As a result, we are subject to all of the risks associated with developing and establishing new mining operations and business enterprises including:\n\u00b7\ncompletion of feasibility studies to verify reserves and commercial viability, including the ability to find sufficient gold reserves to support a commercial mining operation;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and cost, which can be considerable, of further exploration, preparing feasibility studies, permitting and construction of infrastructure, mining, and processing facilities;\n\u00b7\nthe availability and costs of drill equipment, exploration personnel, skilled labor, and mining and processing equipment, if required;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental approval and permit requirements;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of funds to finance exploration, development, and construction activities, as warranted;\n\u00b7\npotential opposition from non-governmental organizations, environmental groups, local groups, or local inhabitants which may delay or prevent development activities;\n\u00b7\npotential increases in exploration, construction, and operating costs due to changes in the cost of fuel, labor, power, materials, and supplies; and\n\u00b7\npotential shortages of mineral processing, construction, and other facilities-related supplies.\nThe costs, timing, and complexities of exploration, development, and construction activities may be increased by the location of our properties and demand by other mineral exploration and mining companies. It is common in exploration programs to experience unexpected problems and delays during drill programs and, if warranted, development, construction, and mine start-up. Accordingly, our activities may not result in profitable mining operations and we may not succeed in establishing mining operations or profitably producing metals at any of our properties. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and we can provide investors with no assurance that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations.\nWe have a history of losses and expect to continue to incur losses in the future.\nWe have incurred losses since inception and expect to continue to incur losses in the future. We incurred the following net losses during each of the following periods:\n\u00b7\n$5,961,907 for the year ended September 30, 2022\n\u00b7\n$4,707,815 for the year ended September 30, 2021; and\n\u00b7\n$3,377,091 for the year ended September 30, 2020\nWe had an accumulated deficit of approximately $74.3 million as of September 30, 2022. We expect to continue to incur losses unless and until such time as one of our properties enters into commercial production and generates sufficient revenues to fund continuing operations. We recognize that if we are unable to generate significant revenues from mining operations and dispositions of our properties, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. At this early stage of our operation, we also expect to face the risks, uncertainties, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies at the start-up stage of their business development. We cannot be sure that we will be successful in addressing these risks and uncertainties and our failure to do so could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition.\nRisks Associated with Mining and Exploration\nAll of our properties are in the exploration stage. There is no assurance that we can establish the existence of any mineral reserve on any of our properties in commercially exploitable quantities. Until we can do so, we cannot earn any revenues from these properties, and if we do not do so, and are unable to joint venture or sell the properties, we will lose all of the funds that we expend on exploration. If we do not discover any mineral reserve in a commercially exploitable quantity, our business could fail.\nWe have not established that any of our mineral properties contain any mineral reserves according to recognized reserve guidelines, nor can there be any assurance that we will be able to do so. A mineral reserve is defined by the SEC in its Regulation S-K subpart 1300 as that part of a mineral deposit, which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The probability of an individual prospect ever having a \"reserve\" that meets the requirements of the SEC's Regulation S-K subpart 1300 is remote. Even if we do eventually discover a mineral reserve on one or more of our properties, there can be no assurance that they can be developed into producing mines to extract those minerals. Both mineral exploration and development involve a high degree of risk, and few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines.\nThe commercial viability of an established mineral deposit will depend on a number of factors including, by way of example, the size, grade, and other attributes of the mineral deposit, the proximity of the mineral deposit to infrastructure such as a smelter, roads, a point for shipping, government regulation, and market prices. Most of these factors will be beyond our control, and any of them could increase costs and make extraction of any identified mineral deposit unprofitable.\nMineral operations are subject to applicable law and government regulation. Even if we discover a mineral reserve in a commercially exploitable quantity, these laws and regulations could restrict or prohibit the exploitation of that mineral reserve. If we cannot exploit any mineral reserve that we might discover on our properties, our business may fail.\nBoth mineral exploration and extraction require permits from various foreign, federal, state, provincial, and local governmental authorities and are governed by laws and regulations, including those with respect to prospecting, mine development, mineral production, transport, export, taxation, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine safety, and other matters. Regarding our future ground disturbing activity on federal land, we will be required to obtain a permit from the US Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management prior to commencing exploration. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain any of the permits required for the continued exploration of our mineral properties or for the construction and operation of a mine on our properties at economically viable costs. If we cannot accomplish these objectives, our business could face difficulty and/or fail.\nWe believe that we are in compliance with all material laws and regulations that currently apply to our activities, but there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so. Current laws and regulations could be amended, and we might not be able to comply with them, as amended. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain all permits necessary for our future operations, or that we will be able to obtain them on reasonable terms. To the extent such approvals are required and are not obtained, we may be delayed or prohibited from proceeding with planned exploration or development of our mineral properties.\nEnvironmental hazards unknown to us, which have been caused by previous or existing owners or operators of the properties, may exist on the properties in which we hold an interest. In past years, we have been engaged in exploration in northern Idaho, which is currently the site of a Federal Superfund cleanup project. Although we are no longer involved in this or other areas at present, it is possible that environmental cleanup or other environmental restoration procedures could remain to be completed or mandated by law, causing unpredictable and unexpected liabilities to arise. At the date of this Annual Report, we are not aware of any environmental issues or litigation relating to any of our current or former properties.\nFuture legislation and administrative changes to the mining laws could prevent us from exploring our properties.\nNew state and U.S. federal laws and regulations, amendments to existing laws and regulations, administrative interpretation of existing laws and regulations, or more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct exploration and mining activities. Any change in the regulatory structure making it more expensive to engage in mining activities could cause us to cease operations.\nRegulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to various climate change interest groups and the potential impact of climate change. Legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us, our venture partners, and our suppliers, including costs related to increased energy requirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting, and other costs to comply with such regulations. Any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be dealt with, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition, operating performance and ability to compete. Furthermore, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation. The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels, and changing temperatures. These impacts may adversely impact the cost, production, and financial performance of our operations.\nIf we establish the existence of a mineral reserve on any of our properties in a commercially exploitable quantity, we will require additional capital in order to develop the property into a producing mine. If we cannot raise this additional capital, we will not be able to exploit the reserve, and our business could fail.\nIf we do discover mineral reserves in commercially exploitable quantities on any of our properties, we will be required to expend substantial sums of money to establish the extent of the reserve, develop processes to extract it, and develop extraction and processing facilities and infrastructure. There can be no assurance that a mineral reserve will be large enough to justify commercial operations, nor can there be any assurance that we will be able to raise the funds required for development on a timely basis. If we cannot raise the necessary capital or complete the necessary facilities and infrastructure, our business may fail.\nLand reclamation requirements for our properties may be burdensome and expensive.\nAlthough variable depending on location and the governing authority, land reclamation requirements are generally imposed on mineral exploration companies (as well as companies with mining operations) in order to minimize long-term effects of land disturbance. Reclamation may include requirements to control dispersion of potentially deleterious effluents and re-establish pre-disturbance land forms and vegetation.\nIn order to carry out reclamation obligations imposed on us in connection with our potential development activities, we must allocate financial resources that might otherwise be spent on further exploration and development programs. We plan to set up a provision for our reclamation obligations on our properties, as appropriate, but this provision may not be adequate. If we are required to carry out unanticipated reclamation work, our financial position could be adversely affected.\nMining exploration and development are inherently hazardous and subject to conditions or events beyond our control, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and plans.\nMining and mineral exploration involves various types of risks and hazards, including:\n\u00b7\nenvironmental hazards;\n\u00b7\npower outages;\n\u00b7\nmetallurgical and other processing problems;\n\u00b7\nunusual or unexpected geological formations;\n\u00b7\npersonal injury, flooding, fire, explosions, cave-ins, landslides, and rock-bursts;\n\u00b7\ninability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment, or labor;\n\u00b7\nmetals losses;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in exploration, development, and production costs;\n\u00b7\nlabor disputes;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated variations in grade;\n\u00b7\nmechanical equipment failure; and\n\u00b7\nperiodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions.\nThese risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties, production facilities, or other properties, personal injury, environmental damage, delays in mining, increased production costs, monetary losses, and possible legal liability.\nMineral exploration and development is subject to extraordinary operating risks. We do not currently insure against these risks. In the event of a cave-in or similar occurrence, our liability may exceed our resources, which would have an adverse impact on our Company.\nMineral exploration, development, and production involve many risks, which even a combination of experience, knowledge, and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. Our operations will be subject to all the hazards and risks inherent in the exploration, development and production of minerals, including liability for pollution, cave-ins or similar hazards against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure. Any such event could result in work stoppages and damage to property, including damage to the environment. We do not currently maintain any insurance coverage against these operating hazards. The payment of any liabilities that arise from any such occurrence could have a material adverse impact on our Company.\nIncreased costs could affect our financial condition.\nWe anticipate that costs at our projects that we may explore or develop will frequently be subject to variation from one year to the next due to a number of factors, such as changing ore grade, metallurgy, and revisions to mine plans, if any, in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body. In addition, costs are affected by the price of commodities such as fuel, rubber, and electricity. Such commodities are at times subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability.\nA shortage of equipment and supplies could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nWe are dependent on various supplies and equipment to carry out our mining exploration and, if warranted, development operations. Any shortage of such supplies, equipment, and parts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to carry out our operations and, therefore, limit or increase the cost of production.\nEstimates of mineralized material are subject to evaluation uncertainties that could result in project failure.\nOur exploration and future mining operations, if any, are and would be faced with risks associated with being able to accurately predict the quantity and quality of mineralized material within the earth using statistical sampling techniques. Estimates of any mineralized material on any of our properties would be made using samples obtained from appropriately placed trenches, test pits, and underground workings and intelligently designed drilling. There is an inherent variability of assays between check and duplicate samples taken adjacent to each other and between sampling points that cannot be reasonably eliminated. Additionally, there also may be unknown geologic details that have not been identified or correctly appreciated at the current level of accumulated knowledge about our properties. This could result in uncertainties that cannot be reasonably eliminated from the process of estimating mineralized material. If these estimates were to prove to be unreliable, we could implement an exploitation plan that may not lead to commercially viable operations in the future.\nMineral prices are subject to dramatic and unpredictable fluctuations.\nWe expect to derive revenues, if any, from the eventual extraction and sale of precious metals such as gold and silver. The price of those commodities has fluctuated widely in recent years, and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including international, economic and political trends, expectations of inflation, currency exchange fluctuations, interest rates, global or regional consumptive patterns, speculative activities and increased production due to new extraction developments, and improved extraction and production methods. The effect of these factors on the price of precious metals, and, therefore, the economic viability of any of our exploration projects, cannot accurately be predicted.\nThe mining industry is highly competitive and there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in acquiring mineral claims. If we cannot continue to acquire properties to explore for mineralized material, we may be required to reduce or cease exploration activity and/or operations.\nThe mineral exploration, development, and production industry is largely fragmented. We compete with other exploration companies looking for mineral properties and the minerals that can be produced from them. While we compete with other exploration companies in the effort to locate and license mineral properties, we do not compete with them for the removal or sales of mineral products from our properties if we should eventually discover the presence of them in quantities sufficient to make production economically feasible. Readily available markets exist worldwide for the sale of gold and other mineral products. Therefore, we will likely be able to sell any gold or mineral products that we identify and produce.\nThere are hundreds of public and private companies that are actively engaged in mineral exploration. A representative sample of exploration companies that are similar to us in size, financial resources, and primary objective include such publicly traded mineral exploration companies as Allegiant Gold Ltd. (AUAU.V), NuLegacy Gold Corp (NUG.V), First Vanadium Corp (FVAN.V), Adamara Minerals Corp. (ADZ.V), Comstock Mining Inc. (LODE).\nMany of our competitors have greater financial resources and technical facilities. Accordingly, we will attempt to compete primarily through the knowledge and experience of our management. This competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire suitable prospects for exploration in the future. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will acquire any interest in additional mineral properties that might yield reserves or result in commercial mining operations.\nThird parties may challenge our rights to our mineral properties, or the agreements that permit us to explore our properties may expire, if we fail to timely renew them and pay the required fees.\nIn connection with the acquisition of our mineral properties, we sometimes conduct only limited reviews of title and related matters, and obtain certain representations regarding ownership. These limited reviews do not necessarily preclude third parties from challenging our title and, furthermore, our title may be challenged as defective. Consequently, there can be no assurance that we hold good and marketable title to all of our mining concessions and mining claims. If any of our concessions or claims were challenged, we could incur significant costs and lose valuable time in defending such a challenge. These costs or an adverse ruling with regards to any challenge of our titles could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. There can be no assurance that any such disputes or challenges will be resolved in our favor.\nWe are not aware of challenges to the location or area of any of our mining claims. There is, however, no guarantee that title to the claims will not be challenged or impugned in the future.\nAcquisitions and integration issues may expose us to risks.\nOur business strategy includes making targeted acquisitions. Any acquisition that we make may be of a significant size, may change the scale of our business and operations, and may expose us to new geographic, political, operating, financial, and geological risks. Our success in our acquisition activities depends on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, negotiate acceptable terms for any such acquisition and integrate the acquired operations successfully with our own. Any acquisitions would be accompanied by risks. For example, there may be significant decreases in commodity prices after we have committed to complete the transaction and have established the purchase price or exchange ratio; a potential mineralized property may prove to be below expectations; we may have difficulty integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise and maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization; the integration of the acquired business or assets may disrupt our ongoing business and our relationships with employees, customers, suppliers, and contractors; and the acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant. If we choose to use equity securities as consideration for such an acquisition, existing shareholders may suffer dilution. Alternatively, we may choose to finance any such acquisition with our existing resources. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with such acquisitions.\nJoint ventures and other partnerships in relation to our properties may expose us to risks.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, entered into joint ventures or other partnership arrangements with other parties in relation to the exploration, development, and production of certain of the properties in which we have an interest. Joint ventures can often require unanimous approval of the parties to the joint venture or their representatives for certain fundamental decisions such as an increase or reduction of registered capital, merger, division, dissolution, amendments of constating documents, and the pledge of joint venture assets, which means that each joint venture party may have a veto right with respect to such decisions which could lead to a deadlock in the operations of the joint venture or partnership. Further, we may be unable to exert control over strategic decisions made in respect of such properties. Any failure of such other companies to meet their obligations to us or to third parties, or any disputes with respect to the parties' respective rights and obligations, could have a material adverse effect on the joint ventures or their properties and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial performance, cash flows, and the price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nMinimal staffing may be reasonably likely to materially affect the Companys internal control over financial reporting\nWith a very limited staff, it is difficult to maintain appropriate segregation of duties in the initiating and recording of transactions, thereby creating a segregation of duties weakness. Due to the significance of segregation of duties to the preparation of reliable financial statements, this weakness may result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement or lack of disclosure within the annual or interim financial statements not be prevented or detected.\nConflicts of Interest\nCertain of our officers and directors may be or become associated with other businesses, including natural resource companies that acquire interests in mineral properties. Such associations may give rise to conflicts of interest from time to time. Our directors are required by Delawares General Corporation Law to act honestly and in good faith with a view to our best interests and to disclose any interest, which they may have in any of our projects or opportunities. In general, if a conflict of interest arises at a meeting of the board of directors, any director in a conflict will disclose his interest and abstain from voting on such matter or, if he does vote, his vote will not be counted.\nWe have not adopted any separate formal corporate policy regarding conflicts of interest; however, other corporate governance measures have been adopted, such as creating a directors audit committee requiring independent directors. Additionally, our Code of Ethics does address areas of possible conflicts of interest. As of the date of filing of this report, we had two independent directors on our board of directors (Leigh Freeman and Pamela Saxton). We have formed three committees to ensure our legal compliance. We established an independent audit committee consisting of two independent directors, both of whom were determined to be financially literate and one of whom was designated as the financial expert. We also formed a compensation committee comprised entirely of independent directors and a corporate governance and nominating committee, a majority of which is comprised of independent directors. At this time, we feel that these committees and our Code of Ethics provide sufficient corporate governance for our purposes.\nDependence on Key Management Employees and Contractors\nOur ability to continue our exploration and development activities and to develop a competitive edge in the marketplace depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and maintain qualified key management personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel. Our development now and in the future will depend on the efforts of key management figures such as Patrick Highsmith, Steven Osterberg, Donald McDowell and Ted Sharp. The loss of any of these key people could have a material adverse effect on our business. In this regard, we have attempted to reduce the risk associated with the loss of key personnel and have obtained directors and officers insurance coverage. In addition, our shareholders have approved our 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan and 2018 Incentive Plan so that we can provide incentives for our key personnel.\nWe may not realize the benefits of Eureka, Paiute, Seven Troughs and other acquired growth projects.\nAs part of our strategy, we will continue existing efforts and initiate new efforts to develop gold and other mineral properties. We have three such project areas, including Eureka, Paiute and Seven Troughs. A number of risks and uncertainties are associated with the development of these types of projects, including political, regulatory, design, construction, labor, operating, technical and technological risks, and uncertainties relating to capital and other costs and financing risks. The failure to successfully develop any of these initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nAs part of our business model, we pursue a strategy that may cause us to expend significant resources exploring properties that may not become revenue-producing sites.\nPart of our business model is to pursue a strategy which includes significant exploration activities, such as proposed exploration and, if warranted, development at the Eureka, Paiute, and the Seven Troughs Projects. Because of the nature of exploration for precious metals, a propertys exploration potential is not known until a significant amount of geologic information has been generated. We may spend significant resources exploring and developing the projects and gathering certain geologic information only to determine that the project is not capable of being a revenue-producing property for us.\nOur business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity, and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by Congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. For example, on July 21, 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) with increased disclosure obligations for public companies and mining companies in the United States. Our efforts to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and other new regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of our managements time and attention from operating activities to compliance activities.\nWe are required to comply with Canadian securities regulations and are subject to additional regulatory scrutiny in Canada.\nWe are a reporting issuer in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta. As a result, our disclosure outside the United States differs from the disclosure contained in our SEC filings. Our reserve and resource estimates disseminated outside the United States are not directly comparable to those made in filings subject to SEC reporting and disclosure requirements, as we generally report reserves and resources in accordance with Canadian practices. These practices are different from the practices used to report reserve and resource estimates in reports and other materials filed with the SEC. It is Canadian practice to report measured, indicated, and inferred resources, which are generally not permitted in disclosures filed with the SEC. In the United States, mineralization may not be classified as a reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. United States investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated resources will ever be converted into reserves. Further, inferred resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. Disclosure of contained ounces is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC only permits issuers to report resources as in-place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. Accordingly, information concerning descriptions of mineralization, reserves, and resources contained in disclosures released outside the United States may not be comparable to information made public by other United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC.\nWe are also subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and costs associated with complying with securities legislation in Canada. For example, we are subject to civil liability for misrepresentations in written disclosure and oral statements. Legislation has been enacted in these provinces which creates a right of action for damages against a reporting issuer, its directors and certain of its officers in the event that the reporting issuer or a person with actual, implied, or apparent authority to act or speak on behalf of the reporting issuer releases a document or makes a public oral statement that contains a misrepresentation or the reporting issuer fails to make timely disclosure of a material change. We do not anticipate any particular regulation that would be difficult to comply with. However, failure to comply with regulations may result in civil awards, fines, penalties, and orders that could have an adverse effect on us.\nRisks Associated with Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been volatile and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQB Market (OTCQB) and traded on the TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V). The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include price fluctuations of precious metals, government regulations, disputes regarding mining claims, broad stock market fluctuations, and general economic conditions in the United States and Canada.\nWe do not intend to pay any dividends on shares of our common stock in the near future.\nWe do not currently anticipate declaring and paying dividends to our shareholders in the near future, and any future decision as to the payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our earnings, financial position, capital requirements, plans for expansion, and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. It is our current intention to apply net earnings, if any, in the foreseeable future to finance the growth and development of our business.\nInvestors interests in our Company will be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per share, if we issue additional employee/director/consultant options or if we sell additional shares and/or warrants to finance our operations.\nWe have not generated material revenue from exploration since the commencement of our exploration stage in January 2004. In order to further expand our company and meet our objectives, any additional growth and/or expanded exploration activity may need to be financed through sale and issuance of additional shares, including, but not limited to, raising finances to explore our properties. Furthermore, to finance any acquisition activity, should that activity be properly approved, and depending on the outcome of our exploration programs, we may also need to issue additional shares to finance future acquisitions, growth and/or additional exploration programs at any or all of our projects or to acquire additional properties. We may also in the future grant to some or all of our directors, officers, insiders, and key employees options to purchase our common shares and stock unit awards as non-cash incentives. The issuance of any equity securities could, and the issuance of any additional shares will, cause our existing shareholders to experience dilution of their ownership interests.\nIf we issue additional shares or decide to enter into joint ventures with other parties in order to raise financing through the sale of equity securities, investors' interests in our Company will be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per share depending on the price at which such securities are sold. As of September 30, 2022, there are also outstanding options and warrants granted that are exercisable into 65,749,898 common shares. If all of these options and warrants were exercised, the underlying shares would represent approximately 29.2% of our issued and outstanding shares. If all of these options and warrants are exercised and the underlying shares are issued, such issuance will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other shareholders. The dilution may result in a decline in the market price of our shares.\nWe are subject to the continued listing criteria of the TSX-V and our failure to satisfy these criteria may result in delisting of our shares of common stock.\nOur shares of common stock are currently listed on the TSX-V. In order to maintain the listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial, and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders equity and a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to objective standards, the TSX-V may delist our securities if, in their discretionary opinion: (i) our financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; (ii) it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on TSX-V inadvisable; (iii) we sell or dispose of principal operating assets or cease to be an operating company; (iv) we fail to comply with the listing requirements of the TSX-V; (v) our shares of common stock sell at what the TSX-V considers a low selling price and if we fail to correct this via a reverse split of shares after notification by the TSX-V; or (vi) any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the TSX-V, in their opinion, inadvisable.\nIf the TSX-V delists our shares of common stock, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of trading market for our securities, reduced liquidity, decreased analyst coverage of our securities, and an inability for us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot Applicable. ITEM 2. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES\nWe have acquired mineral prospects for exploration in Nevada mainly for target commodities of gold and silver, and formerly copper. The prospects are held by both patented and unpatented mining claims owned directly by us or through legal agreements conveying exploration and development rights to us. Most of our prospects have had a prior exploration history, which is typical in the mineral exploration industry. Most mineral prospects go through several rounds of exploration before an economic ore body is discovered, and prior work often eliminates targets or points to new ones. Also, prior operators may have explored under a completely different commodity price structure or technological regime. Mineralization which was uneconomic in the past may be ore grade at current market prices when extracted and processed with modern technology.\nNevada Gold Properties\nThe Company currently controls three mineral properties in Nevada including Eureka, Paiute, and Seven Troughs (Figure 1).\nEureka Project (Battle Mountain/Eureka Trend)\nWe acquired the Eureka Project as part of our acquisition of Staccato Gold Resources Ltd. (Staccato Gold) and its wholly owned subsidiary, BH Minerals USA, Inc. (BH Minerals), in June 2010. Eureka comprises an area of 18,464 acres (~29 square miles) within the Battle Mountain - Eureka Mineral Trend. The propertys northern boundary is located approximately 1 mile south of the town of Eureka, Nevada, in Eureka County.\nThe Eureka Project is situated in the southern part of the Eureka mining district, within T19N, R53E and unsurveyed T17N and T18N, and R53E. The property is also within the bounds of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) 1:24,000-scale 7.5-minute topographic series maps of the Pinto Summit and Spring Valley Summit quadrangles.\nProperty Description\nThe Eureka Project (Figure 2) includes the Lookout Mountain, Windfall and Oswego trends. Gold mineralization generally occurs along three north-to-south trending zones, each approximately 3 to 4 miles (4.8-6.5 km) in strike length. Each of these mineralized zones is open and will require additional in-fill and step-out drilling. There are also other early-stage prospects on the property.\nHistorical production of gold in the district included approximately 112,000 oz at the Windfall Mine, which began operation in 1975 (Russell, 2005). An additional 17,700 oz of gold was produced from the Lookout Mountain Pit which operated in 1987 (Cargill, 1988, Jonson, 1991).\nTimberline pays federal and county claim maintenance fees on the Eureka Project. The federal claim fees are due to the BLM before September 1 of each year, and the county fees are due to Eureka County on November 1 of each year. All unpatented mining claims on the Eureka property have been located under the General Mining Laws of the United States on US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) managed lands.\nFigure 1. Timberline Project Locations\nFigure 2. Timberlines Eureka Project Area and Gold Occurrences\nThe following table summarizes the claims and royalties for the Eureka Project:\nTable 1 - Eureka Project Claim and Royalty Summary\nProperty Name\n& Agreements/Royalties\nType of\nClaim\nNumber of\nClaims\nArea\nLookout Mountain\nMining lease and agreement dated August 22, 2003, and amended on June 1, 2008, between Timberline and Rocky Canyon Mining Company; 3.5% Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty + 1.5% NSR royalty capped at $1.5 million (excludes Trevor and Dave claims); 20-year lease term commencing June 1, 2008; annual advanced royalty payment of $72,000.\nUnpatented\n6,368 acres\nTrail\nTimberline holds title\nUnpatented\n620 acres\nSouth Ratto\nTimberline holds title; 4% NSR\nUnpatented\n1,850 acres\nHoosac\nNorth Amselco\n4% NSR\nUnpatented\n3,100 acres\nLittle Rosa\n(Hoosac royalty applies)\nPatented\n7 acres\nRambler\n(North Amselco royalty applies)\nPatented\n7 acres\nTLRat\nTimberline holds title\nUnpatented\n72 acres\nSilverado/TL 12\n1%-3% NSR\nUnpatented\n947 acres\nSecret Canyon/Oswego\nTimberline holds title.\n(Includes 2 mill sites on Syracuse 1 & 2)\n0 - 3% NSR\nUnpatented\n1,488 acres\nSecret Canyon\n1% NSR\nPatented\n36 acres\nWindfall\nTimberline holds title; 4% NSR\nPatented\n165 acres\nNew York Canyon\nTimberline holds title; 4% NSR\nUnpatented\n862 acres\nQ Claims\nTimberline holds title\nUnpatented\n2,149 acres\nLS Claims\nUnpatented\nTotal Unpatented Lode Claims\n1,043\n18,034 acres\nTotal Patented Lode Claims\n215 acres\nGrand Total of Claim Holdings\n1,036\n18,249 acres\nWe have the right to explore and develop the Lookout Mountain target subject to a mining lease agreement dated August 22, 2003 with Rocky Canyon Mining. The lease was amended on June 1, 2008 to extend the term to 20 years from June 1, 2008, and thereafter for as long as minerals are mined on the project. Advance royalty payments are $6,000 per month, or $72,000 per year. Timberline fulfilled a $1.5 million work commitment on the Lookout Mountain target stemming from the amended lease agreement. A 3.5% NSR royalty, plus a 1.5% NSR royalty capped at $1.5 million (excludes Trevor and Dave claims) exists on the Lookout Mountain claims.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2012, Timberline acquired the Windfall patented claims in a transaction of cash and shares valued at $500,000. There is a 4% NSR royalty on these claims.\nThe Secret Canyon/Oswego, South Ratto, and New York Canyon claim groups are owned by Timberline, subject to royalty agreements. NSR royalties of 2% exist on the projects for claims located within one mile of the Windfall Patented claims. A small portion of the Heiro-Syracuse claim group is subject to an additional 1% NSR royalty.\nThe Hoosac and North Amselco claims are owned by Timberline and were under lease to Royal Crescent Valley, LLC, a subsidiary of Royal Gold, Inc. until July 2021, at which time they terminated the lease. Until the termination of the lease in July 2021, Royal Gold maintained BLM lease payments and Eureka County fees on the Hoosac and North Amselco claim groups.\nAccessibility, Physiography, Climate and Infrastructure\nU.S. Highway 50 passes to the east of the Eureka Project and access is gained by heading south out of Eureka on the highway and connecting with unpaved local roads, some of which are periodically maintained by Eureka County. The turnoff for the New York Canyon claim group is about a half mile south of Eureka on U.S. Highway 50 and is an unpaved road running up New York Canyon on the east side of the claim group.\nThe Windfall group and the northern parts of the Hoosac and Lookout Mountain groups are accessed by the Windfall Canyon Road and its westward extension (the former haul road for the Lookout Mountain Mine), which turns southwest from the highway approximately 2 miles south of Eureka. This road is of uncommon quality and scale for rural Nevada due to its construction as a mine haul road at considerable cost in 1980s dollars.\nThe southern parts of the Eureka Project are accessed by traveling approximately 8 miles south of Eureka on U.S. Highway 50 to South Gate, then 1 mile south-southwest on the Fish Creek Valley Road to the unimproved Secret Canyon Road, then northwest to the southern part of the Hoosac claims. Many dirt tracks within the Eureka property allow additional access.\nThe terrain on the Eureka Project is rugged, with high ridges, steep canyons, and narrow valleys. Elevations range from 7,000 to 9,000 feet (2,100-2,400 m). Ridges show abundant bedrock exposures, slopes and valleys are typically covered by soil and alluvium. Sagebrush abounds in lower-elevation areas while juniper and pi\u00f1on pine cover the higher elevations. Grasses and shrubs grow on the highest ridge tops. The climate of the project area is semi-arid with the area receiving moderate winter snows and occasional summer thunderstorms, with heavy rain from time to time during otherwise hot and dry summers. In winter, access is not maintained off the paved roads and November snow commonly lingers until April.\nSummer temperatures usually consist of many consecutive days over 90\u00ba F (32.2\u00ba C), and temperatures can reach as high as 100\u00ba F (37.8\u00b0 C) or more. Winter temperatures generally range from as cold as below 0\u00ba F (-17.8\u00baC) to, more commonly, in the 20\u00ba to 35\u00baF (-6.67\u00ba to 1.7 \u00ba C) range. Precipitation amounts vary from year to year, averaging about 10.0 inches (25.4 cm) for the area. Several feet of snow may accumulate on the property during the winter months.\nThe Eureka Project is situated in north-central Nevada in an area with established mining infrastructure. Transmission power lines serve Eureka from the north. All essential services such as food and lodging are available in Eureka, including dockage for shipments of heavy equipment. A small airport at Eureka is available for private air transport. Railroad access is also available in the area. The gold mines of north-central Nevada continue to produce a significant portion of the worlds gold, and skilled miners and mining professionals are available in Eureka, and 100 miles to the north in Carlin, Elko, and Spring Creek. Permitting a mining operation in Nevada has been a process with which local, state, and federal regulators are very familiar and generally cooperative.\nThe reader should note that discussions in this document pertaining to assay results and concentrations of gold mineralization span many years and reporting standards have changed considerably over that time. References to historical reports of assay results or the grade (concentration) of gold mineralization may cite results in troy ounces of gold per short ton of rock, which will be abbreviated opt. More recent gold assay or concentration data will be reported in this document as grams of gold per tonne (metric) of rock, which will be abbreviated g/t. In most cases when discussing modern data, we make an effort to cite the unit conversion, which is on the basis of 1.00 opt = 34.286 g/t. We may also cite other historic work in the original US customary system of units, but modern work will be reported in metric units with conversions to US customary in most instances.\nSummary of Modern Exploration by Timberline Resources: 2010-2021 (See below for 2022 and pre-2010 historic summaries)\nThe Eureka Project has excellent potential for continued exploration success. Based on the work of previous companies and by Timberline, gold mineralization at the Lookout Mountain target is currently defined over a structural-stratigraphic corridor that extends up to 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) in strike length. This corridor hosts several areas of drill-indicated gold, and the potential for discovery of additional mineralization is strong. The Lookout Mountain mineralization itself is open for expansion at depth and along strike.\nFrom 2010 through 2013, the exploration work programs totaled approximately $9,000,000 on the Eureka Project. The work during that period delivered sufficient data to support a mineral resource estimate at Lookout Mountain (including a technical report compliant with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101)), conduct initial gold recovery studies, initiate environmental baseline investigations, better understand the controls of mineralization, and to outline additional exploration drill targets. In summary, these objectives were met in the 2010-2013 exploration by completion of the following:\n\u00b7\n16,675 feet (5,083 m) of core drilling focused primarily for metallurgical and geotechnical scoping studies;\n\u00b7\n46,965 feet (14,315 m) of RC drilling directed primarily at resource in-fill and definition drilling, and;\n\u00b7\nAdditional testing activities, including metallurgical test work on core samples, channel and mini-bulk sampling within the historical Lookout Mountain pit, identification of additional exploration targets beyond the Lookout Mountain Deposit area, and drilling and construction of additional groundwater monitoring wells.\nAn initial technical report entitled, Technical Report on the Lookout Mountain Project, Eureka County, Nevada, USA, compliant with NI 43-101 (2011 Technical Report), was completed on May 2, 2011. The Technical Report was prepared by Mine Development Associates (MDA) of Reno, Nevada under the supervision of Michael M. Gustin, Senior Geologist, who is a qualified person under NI 43-101. The Technical Report details mineralization at the Lookout Mountain Deposit. In addition, significant exploration potential was noted.\nThe mineral resource was modeled and estimated by MDA by statistical evaluation of available drill data utilizing geologic interpretations provided by Timberline. The geologic interpretations were used to constrain gold mineral domains on vertical cross sections spaced at 50- to 100-foot intervals across the extent of the Lookout Mountain mineralization. The cross sections were rectified to the mineral-domain interpretations on level plans spaced at 10-foot intervals, allowing the geostatistical analysis of the modeled mineralization to aid in the establishment of estimation parameters, and interpolating grades into a three-dimensional block model.\nThe final drill results of the 2011 exploration program were successfully incorporated into the updated mineral resource and NI 43-101 compliant Updated Technical Report on the Lookout Mountain Project, Eureka County, Nevada, USA issued by MDA on May 31, 2012 (2012 Technical Report). As a result of the 2011 exploration program, the mineralized zone at Lookout Mountain was successfully extended 600 feet (183m) to the south of the existing mineral deposit, and mineralization was also expanded along the west margin of the deposit. Results from Lookout Mountain, and from the South Adit area, significantly increased the reported mineralization at the Lookout Mountain Deposit.\nAssay results from drilling during the 2012 and 2013 exploration program were incorporated into another update to the resource and NI 43-101 compliant Updated Technical Report on the Lookout Mountain Project, Eureka County, Nevada, USA issued by MDA on April 11, 2013 (2013 Technical Report).\nThe Lookout Mountain Deposit is a large Carlin-type gold system with a defined gold resource (see 2013 Technical Report) and drill-indicated mineralization that extends over a north-to-south trend of approximately 3 miles (~ 5 km). The MDA gold resource estimate includes 508,000 oz (Measured & Indicated) and 141,000 oz (Inferred) as summarized below (Table 2) at the noted cut-off grades.\nTable 2.

The mineralization is associated with extensive zones of fault breccias, collapse breccias, and with orpiment and realgar (arsenic sulfides) which are commonly found in major Carlin-type gold deposits.\nExploration activities at the Eureka Project, including Lookout Mountain, were curtailed during 2014 due to the limited availability of capital. In fiscal 2015, Timberline drilled three holes to the east of the Lookout Mountain resource and confirmed a 2012 partial drill intercept of higher-grade gold mineralization at depth in hole BHSE-152 (Figure 3). The geology in the hole stratigraphically correlates well with gold intercepts occurring up-dip in the resource area. The host rocks tend to be carbonaceous collapse breccias and jasperoid with pyrite (and sometimes arsenic sulfides) at the contact between the Cambrian-aged Dunderberg and Hamburg formations. The four intercepts are thought by Timberline geologists to be mineralogically consistent with higher-grade occurrences as recognized in deeper levels of many Carlin-type gold systems. One of the strongest intercepts from the 2015 drilling included 65 feet (19.8 m) @ 0.09 opt gold (3.09 g/t), including 25.2 feet (7.7 m) @ 0.146 opt gold (5.02 g/t) in BHSE-171 (Table 3). This new zone of higher-grade gold, downdip from the Lookout Mountain Resource, would become known as the Water Well Zone (WWZ).\nFigure 3.

The drilling successfully tested the on-strike, offset, and down-dip extensions of gold mineralization that was previously mined at Windfall. The drill holes were completed over a strike length of approximately 3,000 feet (914 m) and intersected gold mineralization consistent with that reported from historic drilling in the area, highlighted by drill hole BHWF-40, which intersected 80 feet (24.9 m) at 0.09 opt (3.09 g/t) of gold including a subsection of 20 feet (6.1 m) @ 0.26 opt (8.91 g/t) of gold.\nDuring the continued difficult commodities environment of fiscal years 2016 and 2017, the Company did no drilling or significant field work at the Eureka Project. During fiscal year 2018, we conducted internal geologic reviews of the project, with a focus on higher grade (>3 g/t) gold mineralization that is associated with extensive zones of fault breccia, as well as carbonaceous collapse-breccia. The team also compiled and reviewed historical geophysical data. This included property-wide magnetics and three lines of shallow induced polarization/resistivity (IP) data from 1992. These data defined three north-to-south trending anomalies at Lookout Mountain that are partially coincident with the high-grade gold drill intercepts and faults. In addition, a single line of historical controlled source audio magneto-telluric (CSAMT) data which crosses the Lookout Mountain open-pit area was also evaluated.\nThe review of historical data led to design and completion of a detailed gravity survey around Lookout Mountain. The gravity data correlates well with structures identified in the CSAMT and with magnetic signatures and geologic mapping. Together the data outline a graben-like feature, the west boundary of which is extensively drilled and approximately coincident with the existing north-to-south trending gold resource at Lookout Mountain. The central portion of the graben had been tested only locally on the west side by four closely-spaced holes (BHSE-152, -171, -172, -173) at the Water Well Zone, all of which contain relatively high-grade gold. The eastern margin of the graben is marked by the major Dugout Tunnel Fault, which separates down-faulted Ordovician rocks from older Cambrian rocks to the east.\nAdditional field work in 2018 was also completed at the Windfall target. Work there focused on collection of 40 rock chip samples in and between the historical Rustler, Windfall, and Paroni Pits. Highlights included 10 samples with greater than 0.029 opt (1.0 g/t) and 6 greater than 0.088 opt (3.0 g/t) gold, up to a maximum of 0.382 opt (13.1 g/t) gold. In total, 17 samples assayed greater than 0.007 opt (0.250 g/t), documenting the extensive zone of gold mineralization.\nDuring fiscal year 2019, field activities were re-initiated upon entering into the Lookout Mountain LLC Agreement with PM & G Mines, Inc. (PM&G) to fund advancement of exploration with an initial focus on the high-grade mineralization in the vicinity of the Lookout Mountain open pit. Initial work entailed a continuation of re-logging of historical drill core in the resource area, where drilling had delineated a northwest-southeast trend of high-grade gold (defined as drill hole intercepts of \u2265 0.10 opt or ~3 g/t) (Figure 3). This high-grade gold area has a strike length of approximately 500 feet (~150m) within the pit area and is up to 250 feet (~60m) wide. It includes relatively flat lying to moderate dipping gold-bearing zones at multiple elevations, including some exposure in the historical pit. The gold mineralization is constrained, at least in part, by stratigraphy and zones of decalcified collapse breccias in the Dunderberg formation. The breccias locally contain the minerals orpiment and realgar (arsenic sulfides).\nIn addition to relogging historical drill core, a professional land survey was completed in the Lookout Mountain pit area by a Nevada licensed land surveyor. The work was designed as part of a QAQC assessment of historical drill collar data with results to facilitate advancing the project spatial controls to standards required for mine planning, resource modelling and engineering.\nIn early FY2020, the Company filed with the BLM an amended work plan to the 2009 BLM Plan of Operations for Lookout Mountain. The amended work plan proposed bonding with an additional 9 acres of proposed disturbance beyond the existing 28 acres of disturbance. The increased bond will permit construction of up to 249 drill sites and 28,657 feet of road access in the immediate area of the Lookout Mountain open pit. The work plan was subsequently approved in mid-2020.\nDuring the third quarter of FY 2020, PM&G resigned from the joint venture because they failed to meet the minimum earn-in investment requirements. As a result, the planned drill program did not take place. However, upon completion of a financing in August 2020, the Company submitted additional bond capital of $246,013 to the BLM in preparation for renewed drilling at the Lookout Mountain target.\nTwelve RC drill holes totaling 8,000 ft (2,438 m) were completed in FY 2020 within or near the resource area to confirm historical intercepts and as in-fill in mineralized areas (Figure 4). Five of the RC holes were drilled as offsets to the 2015 WWZ discovery drilling. The program continued into early FY2021 with completion of an additional three core holes totaling 4,477 ft (1,365 m). The core holes were completed east of the resource area to test an IP anomaly and down-dip extensions of WWZ mineralization. The core holes did not reach their target depths and were terminated due to drilling difficulties.\nIn late 2020 and early 2021 Timberline announced additional drill results of high-grade gold inside the existing resource and to the east in the WWZ (Figure 3) (see Company news releases dated December 1, 2020 and January 7, 2021). Highlights included:\n\u00b7\nHole BHSE-176 intercepted near surface high-grade gold mineralization, 15.24m averaging 10.09 g/t, beginning at 21.34m downhole depth, including 9.14m of 16.31 g/t, which included 3.05m of 31.40 g/t.\n\u00b7\nHoles BHSE-177 and 178 encountered shallow oxide gold within the existing resource, including 18.29m of 0.87 g/t (from surface), 48.77m of 1.00 g/t, and 59.44m of 0.63 g/t.\n\u00b7\nHoles BHSE-180, 181, and 182 confirmed northward and down dip extensions of mineralization beyond the Lookout Mountain pit, including gold intercepts of up to 18.29m of 1.58 g/t in the latter of these holes.\n\u00b7\nHole BHSE-184 drilled 18.29m @ 0.93 g/t gold in the shallow sub-surface below the historical pit.\n\u00b7\nHole BHSE-186 intercepted 6.10 m of near surface high-grade gold (5.21 g/t) and a separate, broader zone (25.91 m) at 0.77 g/t mineralization at further depth within the pit area.\n\u00b7\nHole BHSE-187 encountered 7.62 m of 4.49 g/t gold outside the existing resource area within a broader zone of 32.00 m at 1.82 g/t.\nFigure 4. Lookout Mountain Resource Area 2020-2022 Drilling\nA schematic cross section view from just south of the historical Lookout Mountain pit shows the geology of the resource and WWZ areas (Figure 5). Much of the Lookout Mountain gold resource is associated with the east-dipping Highwall Fault and the east-dipping contact between the Dunderberg formation and the underlying Hamburg formation. Timberline geologists have noted significant multi-staged collapse brecciation at the contact that likely accounts for the development of porosity and permeability. The mineralizing fluids exploited fault zones and favorable horizons as evidenced by associated intense silicification, sulfidation, and carbonaceous replacement. The resulting jasperoid contains abundant fine sooty pyrite and oftentimes, the arsenic sulfide minerals orpiment and realgar. Jasperoid is present as irregular pods and masses of silicification at various levels within the Dunderberg formation, replacing beds and forming locally cross-cutting veins and veinlets. East of the Lookout Mountain resource, the gold mineralization tends to be localized in the basal 10 to 40m of the Dunderberg, which may or may not be silicified.\nThe shale and limestone above the gold mineralization often demonstrate calcite veining that passes into zones of argillic alteration. The Hamburg formation dolomite below the contact is usually pervasively oxidized, weakly mineralized and variably decalcified and, in many areas, completely sanded by removal of all interstitial calcite.\nFigure 5. Schematic Cross Section through Lookout Mountain and Graben Zone\nAs the rock units dip to the east, the mineralization in the WWZ is east, downdip and open from the 2013 gold resource area. The basal Dunderberg formation host is well understood and the 2021 drilling successfully intercepted mineralization approximately where expected.\nThe Timberline team applied geophysics in conjunction with geologic mapping and 3D modeling of drill data to develop targets beyond the resource area for drill testing. A district-scale gravity survey was extended from the Lookout Mountain area over the Eureka property block in the quarter ending December 31, 2021 (Figure 6). In his interpretation and reporting of the gravity data, Jim Wright of Wright Geophysics (Elko, NV) recognized the presence of multiple structures and alteration zones that are consistent with the architecture of a Carlin-type gold district.\nIn late 2021, the Company also retained Simcoe Geoscience Limited to complete a 28 line-km IP survey on the Lookout Mountain Trend. IP geophysics is useful for identifying rocks that are rich in sulfide minerals (such as pyrite) and carbonaceous material, both of which can be enriched in Carlin-type gold systems. The 2021 survey followed-up on sulfides and carbonaceous material encountered in some of the deeper drill holes in 2020. Strong north-south trending IP anomalies were identified within the central part of the graben zone at Lookout Mountain. A second IP survey of 25 line-km was completed by Zonge Geosciences, Inc. (Zonge), which identified similar IP anomalies in the Windfall area farther northeast. Zonge also completed a CSAMT survey along four lines totaling 19 line-kilometers with lines transecting major target areas at the WWZ, West Lookout, Oswego, Rocky Canyon, South Lookout - South Adit, and at Windfall. The additional resistivity data generated from the CSAMT provided enhanced insights into the alteration, faults, and host rock stratigraphy. The combined new geophysical data generated significant improvements in the Companys three-dimensional model of the gold targets at Eureka.\nThe gold systems at the Eureka Project often come to the surface where faults and altered rocks yield soil geochemical anomalies in gold and pathfinder elements. Each of the three major trends at Eureka is reflected in gold anomalies in Timberlines historical soil geochemical dataset. During the summer of 2021, Timberline collected approximately 900 soil samples across the northeastern portion of the Eureka property, which had never been covered by previous workers. The 2021 survey employed new ultra-trace level multi-element analyses of the samples, offering a wider range of elements and much higher sensitivity. We also engaged Mary Doherty of International Geochemical Consultants, LLC (IGC) to integrate the new data with the approximately 5,750 historical samples and statistically level the dataset for new interpretation work. The resulting maps provide near-complete soil geochemical coverage over the northern two thirds of the Eureka Project. The new maps and interpretation provided by IGC recognized numerous distinct soil anomalies consistent with Carlin-type gold geochemistry, particularly emphasizing the Lookout, Windfall, and Oswego trends. The soil data also mapped silver-lead-zinc anomalies consistent with carbonate-replacement type deposits (CRD), best developed in the far northeast of the property at New York Canyon. Modern interpretation tools have helped the team map the major NNW trends and crosscutting NW-SE and NE-SW structures (Figure 7). It is clear from the data that silver and gold mineralization is likely to extend well beyond existing drilling in several areas.\nFigure 6. Eureka Project 2020 - 2021 Geophysical Surveys\nFigure 7. Soil Geochemistry Factor Map Area showing Normalized Au+As+Sb data\nDrilling resumed at Eureka in July 2021, though the program was broken into two parts based on availability of drills and drill crews. Drilling began in July with several RC drillholes and then a diamond core rig commenced work in October 2021. In total, the program included 3,495 meters (11,465 feet) of core and 6,536 meters (21,444 feet) of RC drilling. In some cases, the Company employed RC drilling for the upper portions of the holes (pre-collars) and drilled core through the deeper target zones (core tails). The primary targets for this program were step-outs around earlier gold intercepts and selected fault zones in the WWZ as well as the IP anomaly in the Graben Zone east of the WWZ (Figure 8). We added a few drill holes at Oswego late in the program when surface sampling results became available.\nThe program was successful at expanding the footprint of the new mineralized zone and its average grade and thickness. One of the holes also encountered the first significant silver-lead-zinc (CRD type) intercepts reported from the central portion of the project. Most of the 2021 drilling program was reported during the first quarter of 2022, and the highlights include:\n\u00b7\nBHSE-212C: 41.1m at 5.03 g/t Au, including 19.8m at 9.49 g/t Au;\n\u00b7\nBHSE-220C: 44.2m at 4.10 g/t Au, including 12.2m at 9.18 g/t Au;\n\u00b7\nBHSE-192C: 24.4m at 3.85 g/t Au, including 4.6m at 8.35 g/t Au; and\n\u00b7\nBHSE-206C: 202.7m at 5.28 g/t silver (Ag), including 56.4m at 9.69 g/t Ag, 0.17% Zn, and 0.11% Pb\nThe most important finding from the 2021 drilling campaign was confirmation of the consistency of Carlin-type gold mineralization at the basal contact of the Cambrian aged Dunderberg formation with the Cambrian Hamburg formation. The Dunderberg and its basal contact is the primary host of the gold in the Lookout Mountain deposit, and its downdip continuation is highly mineralized in the WWZ as well. The Hamburg is a thick limestone that is variably altered to dolomite and often subject to solution collapse; the resulting volume loss has also caused the collapse of the overlying Dunderberg. The contact zone is converted into an almost ubiquitous breccia body over a large area at Lookout and the WWZ. This breccia varies from approximately five to more than 40 meters thick, and it was an excellent host for the hydrothermal fluids that deposited the gold.\nThe 2021 drilling encountered thick and high-grade (>3 g/t) gold over a north-south corridor spanning more than 400 meters, as defined by the intercepts in BHSE-220C in the north and BHSE-212C in the south. Using a long section view that extends that trend southwest into the Lookout Mountain resource area, one can see that the Dunderberg-Hamburg contact is mineralized with gold for more than 1 kilometer (Figure 9). The thickness and grade vary, but gold and associated Carlin-type pathfinder elements are enriched in every drillhole that penetrates the contact. As recorded in Table 4, some of the new WWZ intercepts from the 2021 drill program are among the richest on the project when expressed as grade-thickness in gram - meters of gold (thickness of interval multiplied by the average gold grade of the interval).\nThere were also important advances in the understanding of structural geology, stratigraphy, alteration, and geologic controls on the gold mineralization in the WWZ resulting from the 2021 drill program. This was due in large part to the increased use of core drilling instead of RC drilling. This came about because Timberline geologists tested RC vs core drilling at the north end of the WWZ. Drilling in this area with an RC rig encountered an area of higher than usual groundwater inflow (BHSE-205). The resulting samples from the RC rig appeared to be visually favorable, including extreme alteration and abundant sulfide minerals. The assays from that interval were highly enriched in gold, but the grades were lower than expected based on the observed geology. We brought in the diamond core rig to twin the RC hole with core (BHSE-220C) - the two vertical holes were collared just over 2 meters apart. The same mineralized zone was encountered with the core rig, but the results were quite different.\nNot only was the mineralized zone somewhat thicker as reported from core, but the grade was much higher. The literature and anecdotal reports from Nevada commonly cite differences between RC and core samples of 10 - 20%. After canvasing other experienced Nevada geologists, we also heard reports of more extreme discrepancies of 75 - 100%. Such differences are generally ascribed to the possibility that high rates of groundwater inflow to a drillhole could wash away very fine-grained gold-bearing phases such as sooty pyrite and/or clay minerals. These fine mineral phases can be very gold-rich. Some RC rigs are forced to change bits in wet drilling conditions, and it's accepted by many industry experts that tri-cone bits suffer greater sample loss and contamination than hammer bits. In this case, the results from drill core were markedly different from the RC results:\n\u00b7\nBHSE-205 (RC): 36.6m at 1.06 g/t gold\n\u00b7\nBHSE-220C (core): 44.2m at 4.1 g/t gold\nIt is important to note that the discrepancy between sampling results by RC and core drilling is not always so extreme. Additional work during 2022 suggests that core drilling generally yields higher grade-thickness of gold, but this is sometimes because the core drilling appears to more accurately reflect true thickness of the mineralized zones. The comparisons of gold grade between the two methods may be very similar. See below in the review of the 2022 exploration program for more discussion and additional graphics.\nFigure 8.

Timberline geologists collected 67 rock samples from a systematic chip, channel, and trenching campaign at the Oswego gold occurrence. The sampling extended along a 65-metre exposed fault scarp, where historical grab sample results had indicated the presence of high-grade gold. The mapping and sampling in the area identified the Trench Fault as a splay of the Dugout Tunnel Fault. The fault zone hosts an outcrop of oxidized and pervasively silicified rocks that is up to 10 meters high and stretches for more than 60 meters in a northwesterly direction. The results of the channel and trench samples were very positive and are summarized in Table 5.\nTable 5.

Geologic Map of the Oswego Gold Occurrence with Channel Sample Locations and Results\nThe strong results from surface sampling at Oswego came just in time to allow adjustments to the 2021 drill program such that eight RC holes totaling 767 meters could be drilled there. Several of the drill holes at Oswego encountered significant near-surface gold mineralization, much of which appears to be oxidized (See Figure 10). The most significant new gold intercepts from these holes included:\n\u00b7\n35.1m at 2.32 g/t gold (oxide) from 6.1m depth in BHSE-213, including 19.8m at 3.93 g/t gold from 7.6m depth;\n\u00b7\n13.7m at 1.31 g/t gold from 3.0m depth in BHSE-215, including 6.1m at 2.49 g/t gold from 9.1m depth; and\n\u00b7\n9.1m at 1.72 g/t gold from surface and 12.2m at 1.22 g/t gold from 15.2m depth in BHSE-214.\nThe strong gold endowment at Oswego is considered important as Timberlines geologists recognize that the mineralized fault is associated with the eastern margin of the Graben Zone (Figure 8). The fact that some of the mineralization is near-surface and oxidized is also potentially important for future development plans on the project. However, the Oswego mineralization has also been shown to be tightly structurally controlled and (so far) difficult to follow to depth or along strike.\nExploration by Timberline Resources in 2022\nThe success of the 2021 exploration campaign significantly upgraded the Water Well Zone due to repeated drill intercepts of thicker (> 15 meters) and higher grade (>3.0 g/t) gold mineralization. The 2022 drill campaign continued with a focus on the WWZ, but also included exploration holes farther north and south along the Lookout Trend and at Oswego. The program included 20 holes totaling 6,367 meters, approximately 65% of the meterage was with diamond core as opposed to RC (Figure 4). At the time of this writing, results from several drill holes are still pending. The most significant results from 2022 came from the WWZ. Highlights included (using a 0.3 g/t gold cutoff grade):\n\u00b7\nBHSE-221C: 6.1m at 1.83 g/t gold from 332.8m depth, including\no\n1.5m at 3.59 g/t gold from 335.9m depth;\n\u00b7\nBHSE-223C: 39.0m at 1.71 g/t gold from 259.7m depth, including\no\n28.3m at 1.97 g/t gold from 259.7m depth, and including\n\u25a0\n5.9m at 3.71 g/t gold from 259.7m depth;\n\u00b7\nBHSE-224C: 30.5m at 2.56 g/t gold from 317.6m depth, including\no\n18.4m at 3.80 g/t gold from 317.6m depth, and including\n\u25a0\n3.35m at 13.36 g/t gold from 331.3m depth;\n\u00b7\nBHSE-226C: 22.8m at 4.29 grams per tonne (g/t) gold from 339.9m depth, including\no\n7.6m at 11.56 g/t gold from 342.9m depth;\n\u00b7\nBHSE-230C: 3.1m at 10.88 g/t gold from 288.6m depth;\n\u00b7\nBHSE-238C: 16.8m at 2.64 grams per tonne (g/t) gold from 178.9m depth, including\no\n4.6m at 4.45 g/t gold from 182.0m depth;\n\u00b7\nBHSE-239C: 9.4m at 1.09 g/t gold from 194.5m depth; and\n\u00b7\nBHSE-239C: 3.1m at 3.77 g/t gold from 439.5m depth.\nTwo holes in the southern part of the WWZ encountered significant mineralization. This drilling expanded the high grade (>3 g/t) WWZ gold mineralization for another 75 meters farther south to a total of approximately 475m, and the system remains open to the south and southeast.\nDrilling at the north end of the WWZ tested the northward extension of mineralization beyond hole BHSE-220C (drilled in the 2021 program) and exploration targets farther north in a younger Silurian-Ordovician terrane (Figure 11). Three of the holes in the northern part of the WWZ encountered significant gold mineralization, while two holes intersected notable silver-lead-zinc mineralization (Figure 12). Although the WWZ mineralization at the Dunderberg-Hamburg contact appears to be cut-off or down dropped by a major fault on the north, there are lesser intercepts in BHSE-236 and BHSE-239C indicating that Carlin-type gold mineralization does extend into the younger rocks north of the major Relay Zone fault.\nThe silver intercepts from the 2022 drilling in the northern WWZ are summarized below (using a cut-off grade of 1.0 g/t for silver):\n\u00b7\nBHSE-221C: 35.1m at 10.1 g/t silver from 329.8m depth;\n\u00b7\nBHSE-237C: 79.2m at 8.2 g/t silver from 297.8m depth; and\n\u00b7\nBHSE-237C: 30.5m at 12.2 g/t silver from 393.8m depth.\nThese drill holes constitute Timberlines first test of the major fault zone that cuts through the northern part of the Lookout Mountain and Water Well deposits. The significant silver intercepts in this area confirm the presence of overlapping gold and silver systems in this area. The Rocky Canyon Target, to the north of the Lookout Mountain resource area, also includes a mix of significant gold and silver intercepts. These are not isolated occurrences in the Eureka District, as i80 Gold Corp has been reporting significant silver and Carlin-type gold intercepts from the Ruby Hill Mine during 2022. Other explorers have also reported gold and silver intercepts in the same general area of their projects. However, these new silver intercepts in the Relay Zone were completely blind before drilling, and they appear to be the southernmost indication of a possible CRD system in the Eureka District.\nDrill hole BHSE-237C cut more than 200m of strongly enriched silver, as did previously reported hole BHSE-206C (see press release dated March 24, 2022). The maximum silver assays in these intervals are 120 and 145 g/t over narrow widths. The silver is correlated with anomalous lead and zinc, up to 1% over narrow widths, and low levels of anomalous gold. These polymetallic zones are often associated with intrusive dikes of granitic composition. These characteristics are consistent with CRD type mineralization, and it is noteworthy that neither the known occurrences of intrusive rocks nor the huge IP anomaly in the underlying graben have been well drilled. These are only the first holes into a new type of target along the Lookout Trend.\nThe Company is currently attempting to collect age dates on intrusive rocks from the Relay fault zone that may be associated with the silver mineralization. Elsewhere in the district, similar units have been determined to be of Cretaceous age, the likely age of the silver deposits for which Eureka became famous.\nThis phenomenon of overlapping mineral systems is an important characteristic of the major Carlin type gold districts of Nevada. The Carlin Trend and Cortez District both include multiple ages of mineralization, including earlier silver and base metal events. Recent exploration success from i80 Gold Corp and these early indications from Timberline are providing supporting evidence that the Eureka District will follow suit.\nThe 2022 drilling also included three holes at the Oswego target where some drill success has been had in the wake of high-grade surface gold sampling reported in 2021. At the time of this Annual Report, assays are pending for these drill holes.\nFigure 11 - Plan View of 2022 Drilling with Water Well Zone, North Lookout, and Rocky Canyon\nThe 2022 drilling of the WWZ successfully expanded the zone to a footprint of 475m north-south and up to 125m east-west. The WWZ remains open to the south and downdip to the east. A total of 23 drillholes have now passed through the mineralized host horizon where it averages 17.8m thick with an average gold grade of 2.97 g/t. There were several intervals within the WWZ footprint ranging from 3 to 41.1m thick in which the gold grade was higher than 4.5 g/t. The expanded footprint of the zone, if demonstrated to have continuity, has the potential to significantly grow the Lookout Mountain Resource.\nA significant outcome of the 2022 drilling campaign was an improved understanding of the structural geology of the WWZ. Timberline geologists identified a number of faults that were not previously known. In some cases, the faults appear to control higher-grade, and in other cases, the faults have offset the host rocks and therefore appear to cut off the mineralization. The newly updated cross sections shown in Figures 12 and 13 reflect the improved understanding of the geology of the WWZ. The zone still appears to have good continuity, as alteration and anomalous gold are consistently present at the key contact, but the controls on higher-grade gold are sometimes difficult to determine.\nAs drilling approaches the major Relay fault zone to the north, the cross section through the WWZ shows a high density of faults (blue lines on the section). There is an upthrown block that is bounded and cut by several faults. The upthrown section hosts the high-grade intercept reported in BHSE-220C early in 2022, and the high-grades through that interval may be related to the presence of low-angle faults. These faults explain why follow-up drilling in BHSE-221, BHSE-237, and BHSE-238 failed to intersect the same thickness and quality of gold mineralization. The majority of the faults that cut the Dunderberg-Hamburg contact have not been drill tested, nor have the deeper sections of that contact to the east.\nFigure 12 Cross Section Looking North through Northern WWZ (Line 4363275N)\nThe southern end of the WWZ is host to the best hole yet drilled into the zone, BHSE-212C. Here, as in the northern part of the zone, the drilling indicates that mineralization is more than 40m thick, including a high-grade interval near the top of the zone spanning 19.8m that averaged 9.49 g/t gold (Figure 13). There are differences in the WWZ between north and south. For instance, the strong gold zone starts at only 140m below surface in the north, whereas the key horizon begins at greater depth in the south, 316m below surface. The Dunderberg-Hamburg contact is the primary host throughout the WWZ, but increased drilling has revealed that the high-grade interval in BHSE-212C is associated with a trough, or topographic low, in the top of the Hamburg. This is contrary to the relative topographic high in the top of the Hamburg exhibited in the north.\nDuring 2022, Timberline drilled offsetting holes around BHSE-212C with varying results. BHSE-226C extended the zone to the south by 75m with an intercept of 22.8m averaging 4.29 g/t gold, whereas BHSE-230C encountered thinner, but still strong, mineralization to the north (8.7m at 2.01 g/t gold and 3.1m at 10.88 g/t gold). At the time of this writing, the Company is still awaiting final results from other holes in the area, to the west and east primarily. It is again apparent that the gold zone in the WWZ is consistent but variable. Evidence from the drilling to date at WWZ suggests that the main gold zone pinches and swells, and the controls on the thicker and higher-grade sections are primarily related to faults.\nFigure 13 Cross Section Looking North through Southern WWZ (Line 4362875N)\nAnother important learning from Timberlines 2022 drill program was that RC drilling can yield satisfactory results in the WWZ, but core drilling does appear to return (at least somewhat) thicker and higher grade than RC over the same intervals. The Company has now conducted three such tests and the results were not entirely consistent. During 2021, Timberline reported that a comparison between RC hole BHSE-205 and core hole BHSE-220C resulted in much higher-grade gold assays over greater width by core when compared to the RC. However, this years test compared two more core holes with RC holes, but the holes werent exactly twins due to approximately 25m deviation by both RC holes. BHSE-223C (core) was drilled close to BHSE-187 (RC); and BHSE-224C (core) was drilled close to BHSE-209 (RC). As reported in a Company news release dated September 14, 2022, one of the pairs compared very well, while the other comparison was markedly different.\nFigure 14 shows the 2021 test of BHSE-205 vs 220 alongside the 2022 test of BHSE-187 vs 223. In the case of 205 vs. 220, the results show few similarities. The distribution of gold grade between the core and RC holes is quite different, particularly with respect to the central part of the interval that was consistently high grade in the core hole. In fact, the RC samples did not return any +10 g/t gold assays. Whereas both the grade distribution and absolute gold assay values compare much better between BHSE-187 and 223. The richest part of the interval is near the top in both cases, but the RC samples yielded higher gold maxima in the assays. The Timberline technical team has concluded that RC drilling can be effective at WWZ, so long as the drill has sufficient compressor capacity and is operated by an experienced team.\nFigure 14 Comparison of RC vs Core Drilling Tests at WWZ\nHistoric Exploration: 2005 to 2010 (Staccato Gold)\nStaccato Gold (Staccato) advanced exploration of the Eureka Project and completed drilling between 2005 and 2007, and in follow-up initiated a comprehensive work program in June 2008 which included geologic modeling of all drilling results. This modeling included structural and stratigraphic controls to mineralization, additional density determinations, and new drilling and metallurgical test data. Results of this work were incorporated into subsequent exploration work completed since 2008.\nFrom 2005 to 2007, core drilling programs at Lookout Mountain completed by Staccato Gold provided data to better define stratigraphy in the higher-grade breccia-hosted gold zones at the Lookout Mountain pit and discovered new areas of mineralization. The core drilling program demonstrated the stratabound nature of gold mineralization in thick zones of collapse breccia within the Ratto Ridge structural zone. Former Timberline director, David Mathewson, was a consulting geologist for Staccato during this period, leading much of the core logging and development of the geological model at Lookout Mountain. Metallurgical and other technical characteristics of known mineralization were also investigated at Lookout Mountain.\nAn exploration Plan of Operations was prepared by Staccato and was approved in 2009 by the BLM and the State of Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (NDEP) for the Lookout Mountain Trend. The Plan of Operations called for approximately 266 acres of disturbance that can be accessed for use in a phased approach and covers the entire structural corridor. The Plan of Operations allowed ground disturbance to complete additional infill, metallurgical, and exploration drilling necessary to advance the development of the Lookout Mountain Deposit and other targets along the trend.\nIn October 2009, Staccato also initiated work at the Windfall Target including detailed mapping and sampling programs and completed a ten-hole drill program totaling 8,030 feet (2,448 m). The drilling program focused on testing the extent of gold mineralization below the Windfall and Rustler open pits, located approximately 3 miles northeast of the main Lookout Mountain mineralized area.\nResults from the surface mapping program, review of historical production and geologic maps, and drilling indicated that high-grade gold is locally controlled within cross structures cutting the main Windfall fault zone, at the contact between the Hamburg Dolomite and Dunderberg Shale. The 2009 drill program tested approximately 3,600 feet (1,097 m) of strike length of the Windfall fault zone with wide spaced drilling. The Windfall fault zone is part of an extensive mineralized structural trend which extends for over 17,000 feet (5,182 m) based on historical data.\nAll holes in the 2009 exploration program encountered thick intercepts of low-grade gold (holes 5-12) or anomalous gold mineralization (holes 13 and 14) within the Windfall fault zone. The offset and exploration holes as drilled define the Windfall Fault as a 150 to 200-foot (46 - 61 m) wide zone striking roughly north-to-south and dipping approximately 60 degrees to the east, containing two or more significant zones of mineralization.\nFive of the ten holes were drilled as offsets to follow up on the high-grade gold intercept drilled in hole 4, which intersected 75 feet (23 m) at 0.153 opt gold, and five other holes were drilled to test the strike and dip extent of the Windfall fault zone. Several thick intercepts of gold mineralization were returned, including 135 feet (41 m) at 0.011 opt gold in hole 7, 135 feet (41 m) at 0.016 opt gold in hole 8, 115 feet (35 m) at 0.010 opt gold in hole 9, and 100 feet (30.5m) at 0.018 opt gold in hole 11.\nA secondary hanging wall structure identified by the mapping program was also encountered in drill holes 7, 8, 11, and 13 and is characterized by strong silicification and decalcification of Windfall Formation and Dunderberg Shale in the hanging wall side of the fault, with Dunderberg Shale and Hamburg Dolomite on the footwall side. Drilling indicates a down to the east offset of the Dunderberg - Hamburg contact. This secondary structure represents an attractive and untested target at depth.\nHistorical Exploration: 1970s to 1990s\nOn the Windfall, Hamburg Ridge, and New York Canyon claim groups, Bill Wilson of the Idaho Mining Corp, then Windfall Venture, later Norse-Windfall, initiated reconnaissance mapping, soil and rock chip sampling, trenching, and drilling in the early 1970s. He noted that the original underground Windfall Mine, which was discovered in 1908 and produced approximately 65,000 tons of invisible gold mineralized rock grading 0.368 opt, was a Carlin-type sediment-hosted disseminated gold occurrence. Wilsons work emphasized the east side of Hamburg Ridge and the Windfall Trend, where he drilled conventional air rotary holes. The drill holes were generally from 50 to 250 feet deep. Six of Wilsons original forty-three Z-holes intersected gold mineralization exceeding 0.02 opt gold. This success led to infill drilling and the development of the Windfall open pit mine in 1975, and soon thereafter, the Rustler and Paroni open pit mines. Gold was extracted in a heap-leach operation from sanded and silicified dolomite and silicified shale.\nNo geologic maps exist from this period other than a few maps compiled from USGS work. Although many drill hole location maps are archived in the files of Century Gold Corp., the coordinates for many drill hole collars are not available, very few collars are visible in the field, and assay data from infill drilling is poorly documented.\nTable 5.

The table below summarizes historic drilling by company, era, and focus of their exploration. These data are compiled from historic company reports and, in many cases, have been at least partially validated with the presence of drill cuttings or core in the Companys inventory. These drilling programs were conducted concurrent with and guided by geologic mapping, geochemical rock and soil sampling programs, and air and ground geophysics. Geological mapping and geochemical programs were very successful in discovering target areas characterized by permissive structures and traces of gold with arsenic, antimony, and mercury anomalies in soil and rock.\nThe methods of collection and analyses of some historical soil and rock samples were not always available in the data, but it is likely that the samples were collected, documented, prepared, and analyzed to the standards of professional diligence and analytical techniques applicable at the time. The importance of a geochemical-geological exploration approach is evidenced by the fact that the drilling of many such anomalies resulted in significant indications of disseminated gold mineralization. The Windfall, Rustler, and Paroni Deposits on the Windfall claims and the Lookout Mountain Deposit were discovered by drilling soil and rock anomalies in permissive structural and stratigraphic settings. Drill testing of several geochemical anomalies in permissive geological settings has also resulted in the discovery of several additional promising zones of gold mineralization on the Hamburg Ridge, Windfall, and Lookout Mountain claim groups. As yet, these zones have not been fully tested.\nAmselco Exploration began exploring the Lookout Mountain project in 1978, conducting extensive geologic mapping, soil and rock sampling and an initial 15-hole reverse circulation (RC) drilling program which tested gold mineralization along the Ratto Ridge Fault and associated geochemical anomalies and jasperoids developed along the north-to-south trending Ratto Ridge. This drilling discovered significant sediment-hosted disseminated gold mineralization at depth. Amselco drilled 296 holes between 1978 and 1985, also discovering five areas of gold mineralization along Ratto Ridge which contain partially developed gold resources. These areas are located at South Lookout Mountain, Pinnacle Peak, Triple Junction, South Ratto Ridge, and South Adit. In 1986, while Amselco was in process of becoming BP Minerals, Amselco management optioned the Lookout Mountain Deposit to a joint venture of three companies, which then owned Norse-Windfall Mines.\nIn 1990, EFL Gold Mines took bulk samples from the floor of the Lookout Mountain pit. These samples returned assay values ranging from 0.10 to 0.135 opt gold. EFL also drilled nine holes, two of which penetrated 500 feet (152 meters) into the floor of the pit, that showed both oxide and sulfide gold mineralization.\nDuring the period 1992-1993, Barrick Gold completed geologic mapping, took more than 500 soil samples to expand and fill in Amselcos soil grid, and drilled 42 widely spaced holes, primarily along Ratto Ridge. Drilling targeted favorable stratigraphy at depth near fault intersections. Nevada Gold discovered that geochemical anomalies were apparently controlled by E-NE and N-NW to NW trending cross structures which intersect the north-to-south trending Ratto Ridge Fault. Much of the Nevada Gold work focused on the potential in Cambrian Dunderberg Shale and Hamburg Dolomite east of the Ratto Ridge Fault, and potential in the Devonian Nevada Group, especially the Bartine Limestone west of the fault. Outcrops of Bartine Limestone in the area show weak gold mineralization, strong alteration, and anomalous pathfinder element geochemistry. Nevada Gold drilled 42 holes to a maximum depth of approximately 1,300 feet (400 meters) and encountered several gold intercepts.\nWork by Barrick Gold also included airborne and ground geophysics and a stratigraphic and geochemical study in conjunction with geologic mapping to develop and prioritize several target areas. Approximately 800 rock samples were collected and had high-quality multi-element analyses at MB Associates in California and Activation Laboratories in Canada. However, their work on the various geological and geochemical targets, or additional drilling in areas of known mineralization previously discovered by Amselco, apparently found insufficient mineralization to meet Barrick Golds objectives. It should be noted that the potential for mineralization west of the Ratto Ridge was not significantly explored during this period.\nEcho Bay (1993-95) not only worked Ratto Ridge but also acquired additional ground to the north, south, and southwest. They conducted mapping, sampling, and scattered drilling in the area, exploring deep high-grade potential in the Cambrian Dunderberg Shale and Hamburg Dolomite, and testing Devonian Nevada Group targets west of the Ratto Ridge Fault. Echo Bay drilled several promising holes, including drill hole EBR 27, which intersected 110 feet (34 m) grading 0.043 opt gold in the Dunderberg, and drill hole EBR-9 which intersected 115 feet (35 m) grading 0.043 opt gold in the Nevada Group. Offsets of EBR-9 found 90 feet grading 0.028 opt gold, and another hole, which was lost before reaching planned depth, found 45 feet (14 m) of 0.024 opt gold. Further offsets of EBR-9 and several widely spaced holes averaging 1,000 feet (305 m) deep (EBR 15, 16, 17, 18, and 20) found some anomalous gold along Ratto Ridge but no major intercepts. Eventually, the Echo Bay project totaled 104 RC holes. Faced with depletion of budgets with no significant exploration success, the decline in gold prices and large land payments, Echo Bay decided to drop the property.\nPaiute Project\nThe Paiute Project (formerly referred to as the ICBM Project) is located 6.5 miles due west of Battle Mountain, in the Battle Mountain Mining District, Lander and Humboldt Counties, Nevada. The property consists of 1,346 acres (2.1 square miles) on BLM-administered lands.\nTimberline originally acquired the project in 2010 through acquisition of Staccato Gold, who controlled the project as a non-core asset along with the flagship Eureka Project. Staccato controlled the project through an earn-in joint venture (JV) agreement with Lac Minerals (LAC), a subsidiary of Barrick Gold. Timberline acted as operator of the project through November 2013 earning a 73.7% interest in the project, with LAC holding the remaining interest.\nHistorical exploration demonstrated that gold mineralization is present on the property in styles of mineralization currently being mined elsewhere in the Battle Mountain district including at the Fortitude/Phoenix complex to the south and Lone Tree to the west. An analysis of historical data led to recognition that the property also has porphyry copper-gold characteristics similar to Newmonts nearby historical Copper Basin mine.\nAlthough Timberline controlled the project, as a non-core asset no exploration was completed between 2010 and December, 2013. In December of 2013, Timberline and LAC entered into an agreement with Americas Gold Exploration, Inc. (AGEI) to continue exploration at the project. Under the terms of the agreement, AGEI could earn up to a 51% ownership position in the property and the joint venture by making certain exploration expenditures over a four-year period. If AGEI earned an initial 51% interest, LAC agreed to withdraw from the Joint venture in exchange for a 5% Net Proceeds royalty and to amend the agreement allowing AGEI to increase its equity interest by 19% for a total of 76.6% by making additional exploration expenditures with Timberline retaining the balance of ownership. AGEI also assumed the role as operator of the joint venture.\nOn August 14, 2018 Timberline finalized the re-acquisition of the property from AGEI along with the contiguous Elder Creek property as part of a two-property acquisition from AGEI. Timberline re-assumed the operators position in the underlying property.\nThe underlying JV with LAC is an earn-in agreement and as a result of previous qualifying expenditures by Timberline, AGEI and previous owners, Timberline currently controls 76.1% ownership of the project after 2018-2020 expenditures. LACs parent company, Barrick, is now the operator of Nevada Gold Mines (NGM), a Nevada joint venture between Barrick and Newmont. NGM operates the nearby Fortitude/Phoenix Complex and Lone Tree Mines. Terms of the continued earn-in are as follows:\n\u00b7\nNo mandatory work commitments are included;\n\u00b7\nAs operator, Timberline proposes work budgets with a 30-day option for pro-rata participation by LAC;\n\u00b7\nIf LAC chooses to not participate, ownership dilutes on a pro-rata basis (based on $300,000 earn-in for 60% of the project); and\n\u00b7\nIf diluted project equity reaches 10% or less, LAC converts to a 2% NSR royalty.\nOn November 28, 2018 the Company announced completion of a NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Paiute copper-gold project. The report provides a comprehensive description of the project. The Paiute Project has no known reserves, as defined under Regulation S-K Subpart 1300, and the proposed program for the property is exploratory in nature.\nExploration and Mining History\nBattle Mountain Gold Company and its predecessors held the Paiute property through the early 1990s and drilled nine RC holes within the current claim block. A best intercept of 100 feet (30.5 m) with 925 ppb gold was noted in their drilling.\nLAC re-located the claims in late 1992 and conducted basic field work in 1993 that included geologic mapping, rock and soil sampling, and ground magnetics. In late 1994 they completed a nine-hole RC drilling program to test the main soil anomalies on the property. One drill hole reported 20 feet (6.1 m) of 0.038 opt (1.18 g/t) gold from 20 to 40 feet (6.1 - 12.2 m) that was associated with a narrow vein-like structure in the Harmony Formation.\nPathfinder Exploration joint ventured the property from LAC in early 1995 and completed infill mapping and sampling and target definition. First pass drilling intersected a 200 feet (61m) zone of 411 ppb gold in drill hole ICBM-95-1 within a quartz-actinolite-sulfide veined granodiorite stock or sill. Follow-up RC drilling by Pathfinder in 1996 was highlighted by hole 96-5 which intersected sericitized, chloritized, amphibole-rich monzonite/granodiorite porphyry with secondary biotite from 450-490 feet (137.1 - 179.8m). Mineralization within the last 15.1 feet (4.6 m) of the hole averaged 0.035 opt Au (1.24 g/t) and was accompanied by increased silicification and sulfides (chalcopyrite, pyrite, arsenopyrite).\nPetrographic work by Larson (1996) identified silicified, sulfidic (pyrite, chalcopyrite), quartz/calcite veined quartz monzonite porphyry, Cambrian sandstone/quartzite (Harmony Formation) and diabase lithologies, along with a skarn dominant monzonite or granodiorite porphyry with significant percentages of pyrite, chalcopyrite, and chalcocite.\nGeology of the Paiute Project Area\nIn the Paiute Project area, the Dewitt Thrust Fault places Ordovician Valmy Formation cherts and shales on top of Cambrian Harmony Formation quartz- and feldspathic-sandstones and shales, which are locally calcareous. The Harmony Formation is intruded by seven Cretaceous to Tertiary age granitic to granodioritic intrusives. An older Devonian or Ordovician diabase intrusive is exposed in the southwest part of the project and surrounding area.\nAt Paiute, the granitic to granodiorites intrusives occur as high-level plugs, stocks, dikes and sills. Thermal metamorphism associated with the intrusions produced hornfels, quartzite and skarn in the Harmony Formation sediments. Hydrothermal alteration associated with the intrusions consists of argillization, silicification, quartz veining/stockwork that is accompanied by zones of hydrous iron oxides as fracture fillings, disseminations, and occasional gossans. Chlorite and actinolite occur locally within quartz veins and may represent retrograde metamorphism. Quartz veining occurs throughout the project area and increases in intensity within the alteration zones.\nA series of echelon structures and sub-parallel faults define a strong N 10-20\u00b0 E - striking structural zone through the central part of the property that extends approximately 16,500 feet in length and up to 1,500 feet in width. This fault zone is well defined by field mapping and is the dominant northeast trending feature. Secondary northwest and north striking faults cut the northeast-striking structures. Locally, the structures are occupied by granodiorite porphyry dikes. The structures are typically altered and mineralized.\nPrevious explorers of the Paiute Project have collected 1,283 soil samples and 301 rock samples in the area and analyzed many of them for 14 elements. Copper, gold, arsenic and bismuth trace element anomalies in soils and rocks occur along the N10-20\u00b0E structural zone. A north-northwesterly (N20\u00b0W)-trending zone of elevated copper and gold occurs where increased fracturing and actinolitic alteration of the rocks is spatially associated with intrusives near Pathfinder drill-hole 96-5.\nGarwin (2014) described the major styles of mineralization in the Paiute area as calc-alkaline, porphyry copper-gold, and gold-bearing structurally controlled vein systems. The main gold mineralized zone on the property is coincident with the N10-20\u00b0E structural zone.\nWhere the rock is not oxidized, fresh disseminated and vein pyrite is pervasive throughout the project area. Pyrite is the most abundant sulfide and occurs within the bleached zones coincident with alteration and structural zones. Pyrrhotite is nearly as abundant as pyrite and occurs both within and adjacent to alteration and structural zones. Arsenopyrite appears to be closely related to alteration and occurs only within the alteration zones.\n2018-2019 Timberline Exploration\nExploration expenditures for FY 2018 were limited to geological field reviews, rock grab sampling and assays to characterize surface mineral showings. In addition, an application was submitted to the BLM, with receipt thereafter, of an approved Notice of Intent (NOI) to allow disturbance related to construction of drill roads and pads. The BLM approved the application and the property is fully permitted for road construction and drilling. Work during FY2019 included continued data compilation and review in preparation for drilling planned for FY2020.\nPaiute Project Activity during Fiscal Year 2020:\nDrilling at Paiute was initiated in the 1st quarter of FY2020, and with assay results announced on January 16, 2020 for our first two drill holes. Drilling intercepted long intervals of disseminated gold mineralization in granodiorite porphyry and metamorphosed sandstone (Figure 15, Table 6). Both RC holes were terminated in hard, silicified and mineralized rock.\nHole PCRC 19-01 intercepted 125 feet (38 m) grading 0.012 opt (0.36 g/t) gold with associated pyrrhotite-pyrite-arsenopyrite in silicified, metamorphosed arkosic sandstone. The hole bottomed in 160 ft (49 m) of silicified granodiorite porphyry. The previously identified 2 km-long gold Lone Tree-type structural zone remains largely untested below the 500 feet (152m) depth of historic drilling and is entirely untested over an interval of approximately 500 meters along the trend of the zone. The structural zone includes surface rock chip samples which previously returned multiple values greater than 1.0 g/t of gold including two samples over 0.322 opt (10 g/t) gold and one sample with 1.38 opt (42.9 g/t) gold and 16.9 opt (527 g/t) silver (see Company news release dated May 24, 2018 at http://timberlineresources.co/press-releases).\nTable 6. 2019 Drill Hole Assay Results\nDrill Hole\nFrom\n(feet)\nTo\n(feet)\nInterval\n(feet)\nFrom\n(meters)\nTo\n(meters)\nInterval\n(meters)\nAu\n(g/t)\nAg\n(g/t)\nAs\n(ppm)\nBa\n(ppm)\nS\n(%)\nPCRC19-01\n89.9\n128.0\n38.1\n0.356\n0.4\n1.5\nincluding:\n103.6\n128.0\n24.4\n0.442\n0.5\n1.9\nPCRC19-02\n710 (TD)\n0.0\n216.4\n216.4\n0.271\n0.5\n0.3\nincluding:\n0.0\n12.2\n12.2\n0.606\n0.9\n0.0\n33.5\n42.7\n9.1\n0.488\n0.5\n0.1\n45.7\n70.1\n24.4\n0.514\n0.4\n0.2\n57.9\n65.5\n7.6\n1.123\n0.6\n0.2\n85.3\n118.9\n33.5\n0.359\n0.3\n0.2\n149.4\n152.4\n3.0\n0.511\n0.1\n0.2\n160.0\n166.1\n6.1\n0.340\n0.2\n0.3\n185.9\n195.1\n9.1\n0.400\n1.0\n0.8\n208.8\n216.4\n7.6\n0.478\n0.8\n0.6\n*True thickness of drill intercepts is unknown. **TD: drill hole total depth\nPCRC 19-02 twinned and deepened historical hole ICBM-95-06, which intercepted gold mineralization within highly silica-altered, sulfide-poor (trace - 1% pyrite) granodiorite porphyry. The hole intercepted multiple zones of gold mineralization in granodiorite porphyry and metamorphosed arkosic sandstone, including 40 ft (12 m) of 0.020 opt (0.61 g/t) gold, 80 ft (24 m) of 0.016 opt (0.51 g/t) gold, 25 ft (8 m) of 0.036 opt (1.12 g/t) gold, and 25 ft (8 m) of 0.025 opt (0.48 g/t) gold over its 710 feet (216 m) length and bottomed in mineralization. The mineralization in PCRC 19-02 expands on multiple intercepts in nearby historic holes (see Table 7). Management believes that the Paiute Project has the potential for bulk-mineable, open-pit gold mineralization based on the near surface thicknesses and gold grades drilled to date.\nDuring FY 2020 year the Company also acquired historical IP and magnetic geophysical survey data to further guide future drill targeting of the under-tested structural zone and largely un-tested porphyry gold targets.\nTimberline has conducted no work on the Paiute Project during fiscal years 2021 or 2022, but all BLM and county claim fees have been paid in full.\nFigure 15.

Our acquired interest is as lessee under the terms of a 50-year lease, originally executed in 1975. Terms of the purchase agreement included a cash payment of $50,000 and a 2-percent NSR production royalty reserved to CIT. While the Company is certain of its rights and obligations under the lease, the lessors identification has become somewhat clouded over the years due to passing of the early lessor principal to the agreement and a lack of full clarity as to all the eventual inheritors of the property. We have met our obligations under the lease and have located and secured agreements with the heirs to acquire any of their residual rights. We are moving to have the agreements adjudicated appropriately. We have the option to purchase one-half of the NSR production royalty for $1 million.\nSeven Troughs is an epithermal gold district recognized as yielding some of the highest gold production grades in Nevada history through small-scale operations in the early 20th century. We believe the district has the potential to host a large precious metals system similar to the high-grade gold and silver veins of Japan's world-renowned Hishikari epithermal gold mine.\nWe are under no obligation to make exploration expenditures at Seven Troughs. Since acquiring the property, we have compiled historical mine workings data and completed limited geologic mapping, and geochemical sampling within the district. The Company conducted no significant work on the ground during fiscal years 2020, 2021, or 2022, but all BLM and county claim fees have been paid in full. During FY2022, the Company entertained queries from outside parties about the projects availability and hosted visitors on site.\nOn April 26, 2022, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with Normandy Gold Limited (NDY) to grant NDY a 12-month exclusive option to enter into an earn-in joint venture agreement with the Company regarding the Seven Troughs property. Subject to negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement, the option may provide NDY with the opportunity to solely fund $5,000,000 of exploration over 6 years, make cash payments of $250,000 and issue 2,000,000 NDY shares to the Company to ultimately earn a 75% interest in the property.\nEarn-In Period:\nTo earn an initial 51% interest in the project, NDY must spend $2,000,000 in exploration expenditures and make cash payments of $250,000, as follows:\n\u00b7\n$100,000 of committed expenditures within the first 12 months from exercising the exclusive option;\n\u00b7\n$500,000 of expenditures (an additional $400,000) within 24 months from exercising the exclusive option;\n\u00b7\nPayment to the Company of $100,000 in cash at 24 months from exercising the exclusive option or at such time as the Company demonstrates receipt of full title in the Seven Troughs claims, whichever is later;\n\u00b7\n$2,000,000 of expenditures (an additional 1,500,000) within 36 months from exercising the exclusive option; and\n\u00b7\nPayment to the Company of $150,000 in cash at 36 months from exercising the exclusive option.\nDuring the Earn-In Period, NDY will be the operator of the project and be responsible for payment of annual federal and county claim fees. NDY may withdraw from the Earn-In after spending $100,000, or if the transfer of claims ownership to the Company is not successfully completed within 24 months of commencement of the Earn-In Period.\nJoint Venture Period:\nUpon completion of the Earn-In Period, NDY will hold 51% interest and the Company will have the option (for a period of up to 60 business days) to elect to fund and participate in a Joint Venture on the basis of its 49% interest in the project.\nIf the Company elects not to participate or fails to provide such notice within the 60-business day period, NDY can earn an additional 24% interest (for a total interest of 75%) in the project by:\n\u00b7\nspending $3,000,000 in exploration expenditures within three years from commencement of the joint venture, and\n\u00b7\nIssuing the Company 2,000,000 common shares in the stock of NDY.\nThe Company received $50,000 of the initial cash payment in May 2022 and recorded it as a reduction to mineral rights during that period.\nNew York Canyon:\nOn August 23, 2022, the Company purchased one patented mining claim, comprising of a total of 13.77 acres commonly known as the South Wales #1 patent within the New York Canyon claim block, from Newmont Capital Limited for a total of $41,310. In conjunction with this purchase, the Company granted a 1.5% net smelter return royalty to the seller.\nOn September 28, 2022, the Company purchased five patented mining claims, comprising of a total of 28.82 acres commonly known as the Tiger Lilly, Eureka Giant, Southern Cross, Maria and Best & Belcher patents with and near the New York Canyon claim block, from the University of Nevada, Reno Foundation for a total of $86,460. In conjunction with this purchase, the Company granted a 1.5% net smelter return royalty to the seller. Two of the patented claims are not within the New York Canyon claim block, but will be included with this designation on the Companys claims record references.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company purchased an interest in three patented claims within the New York Canyon claim block, from private parties. In conjunction with the purchase, the Company granted a 0.5% net smelter return royalty to the sellers. The combined purchase price will be capitalized in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as a mineral property on the Companys balance sheet.\nWolfpack Gold Properties\nWith the acquisition of Wolfpack Gold (WPG), we acquired nine mineral properties in Nevada and one in California. We conducted a due diligence review on each property, including organization of the historical data and review of exploration work completed to-date. As of September 30, 2022, only claims on one property (Trail) have been retained, as they are contiguous with our Eureka project.\nIn 2017, we sold our property and royalty interests in various unpatented claims that were under lease to Pershing Gold. In addition, we sold various other royalty interests that WPG had retained through previous transactions in four other properties.\nOverview of Regulatory, Economic and Environmental Issues\nHard rock mining in the United States is a closely regulated industrial activity. Mining operations are subject to review and approval by a wide variety of agencies at the federal, state, and local level. Each level of government requires applications for permits to conduct operations. The approval process always involves consideration of many issues including but not limited to air pollution, water use and discharge, noise issues, and wildlife impacts. Mining operations involve preparation of environmental impact studies that examine the probable effect of the proposed site development. Federal agencies that may be involved include: the USFS, BLM, EPA, NIOSH, MSHA, and FWS. Individual states also have various environmental regulatory bodies, such as Departments of Ecology and Departments of Environmental Quality. Local authorities, usually counties, also have control over mining activity.\nGold, silver, and copper are mined in a wide variety of ways, both in open pit and underground mines. Open pit mines require the gold deposit to be relatively close to the surface. These surface mineable deposits tend to be lower grade (such as 0.01-0.03 opt gold) and are mined using large, costly earth moving equipment, usually at very high tonnages per day. Modern open pit mines are typically very large excavations that require extensive engineering, planning, reclamation, and permitting.\nSome open pit operations for gold in which the ores have bene oxidized involve heap leaching as a metallurgical method to remove the gold. Heap leaching involves stacking the ore on pads which are lined with an impenetrable under-surface, then sprinkling the ore with a weak cyanide solution to extract the gold. The gold-impregnated solution is collected and the gold recovered through further processing. Most new gold discoveries contain ores that are not suitable for heap leach processing. Often this is because the gold is associated with sulfide minerals such as pyrite. Extensive metallurgical testing is required to determine the optimum method for treating such ores, but sulfide ore deposits almost always require complex milling and processing plants.\nUnderground metal mines generally involve higher-grade ore bodies. Less tonnage is mined underground, and generally the higher-grade ore is processed in a mill or other refining facility. An underground mine may have much less visual impact on the land, but the mine design is complex and requires intensive study and careful engineering.\nGold processing plants often generate tailings (the residual material left behind after recovery of the gold-bearing minerals), which require permitted and engineered disposal facilities or tailings ponds. Mines and processing plants also often require extensive water treatment, which again will necessitate extensive interaction with the community and regulators during permitting\nCapital costs for mine, mill, and tailings pond construction can, depending upon the size of the operation, run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. These costs are factored into the profitability of a mining operation. Metal mining is sensitive to both cost considerations and to the value of the metal produced. Metals prices are set on a worldwide market and are not controlled by the operators of the mine. Changes in currency values or exchange rates can also impact metals prices. Changes in metals prices or operating costs can have a huge impact on the economic viability of a mining operation.\nEnvironmental protection and remediation are increasingly important parts of mineral economics. Estimated future costs of reclamation or restoration of mined land are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. Reclamation of affected areas after mining operations may cost millions of dollars. Often governmental permitting agencies are requiring multi-million-dollar bonds from mining companies prior to granting mining permits, to ensure that reclamation takes place. All environmental mitigation tends to decrease profitability of the mining operation, but these expenses are recognized as a cost of doing business by modern mining and exploration companies.\nMining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. We conduct our operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believe our operations follow applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures.\nEvery mining activity has an environmental impact. In order for a proposed mining project to be granted the required governmental permits, mining companies are required to present proposed plans for mitigating this impact. In the United States, where our properties are located, no mine can operate without obtaining a number of permits. These permits address the social, economic, and environmental impacts of the operation and include numerous opportunities for public involvement and comment.\nWe intend to focus on exploration and discovery of mineral resources. If we are successful, the ore bodies discovered will be attractive to production companies, or we will potentially bring the ore bodies to production ourselves. The mining industry, like agriculture, is a fundamental component of modern industrial society, and minerals of all sorts are needed to maintain our way of life. If we are successful in finding an economic ore body, be it gold or silver, sufficient value is expected to be created to reward our shareholders and allow for all production and reclamation expenses to be paid ourselves or by the actual producer to whom we convey, assign, or joint venture the project. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe are not a party to any material pending legal proceedings, and no such proceedings are known to be contemplated.\nNo director, officer, or affiliate of Timberline and no owner of record or beneficial owner of more than 5.0% of our securities or any associate of any such director, officer, or security holder is a party adverse to Timberline or has a material interest adverse to Timberline in reference to pending litigation. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nPursuant to Section 1503(a) of the recently enacted Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (The Dodd-Frank Act), issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States are required to disclose in their periodic reports filed with the SEC information regarding specified health and safety violations, orders and citations, related assessments and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, our U.S. exploration properties were not subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act). The Companys exploration operations received no notices, citations, or orders during the year pertaining to health and safety violations.\nPART II ITEM 5.

Any further determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent on the financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, and other factors that our board deems relevant. We have never declared a dividend.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nNone.\nStock Incentive Plans\nThe purpose of the Stock and Incentive Plan is to promote our interests and our Stockholders interests by aiding us in attracting and retaining employees, officers, consultants, advisors and non-employee directors capable of ensuring the future success of our Company. On September 24, 2015, our stockholders approved the adoption of the Companys 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan in which the Companys executive officers and directors are participants. This plan replaced our 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended. The aggregate number of shares that may be issued under all stock-based awards made under the 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan was 4 million shares of our common stock.\nOn December 1, 2018, shareholders approved the new 2018 Incentive Plan. The 2018 Incentive Plan replaced our 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan. Concurrent with the approval of the 2018 Incentive Plan, the 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan was withdrawn for the purposes of issuing new options or equity incentives. There were 8,000,000 Timberline shares issuable under the 2018 Incentive Plan.\nOn April 14, 2021, shareholders approved to amend and restate the 2018 Incentive Plan. Under the amended plan, the shares issuable under the 2018 Incentive Plan increased to 15,000,000.\nEquity Compensation Plans\nThe following summary information is presented as of September 30, 2022.\nNumber of securities to be\nissued upon exercise of\noutstanding options,\nwarrants, and rights\n(a)\nWeighted-average\nexercise price of\noutstanding options,\nwarrants, and rights\n(b)\nNumber of securities\nremaining available\nfor future issuance\nunder equity\ncompensation plans (excluding securities\nreflected in column (a)) (c)\nEquity compensation plans approved by security holders(1)\n8,335,000 (1)\n$ 0.18\n6,665,000\nEquity compensation plans not approved by security holders\nNot applicable\nNot applicable\nNot applicable\nTOTAL\n8,335,000 (1)\n$ 0.18\n6,665,000\n_________\n(1) See Stock Incentive Plans, above.\nThere were no options exercised during the years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.\nSale of Unregistered Securities\nAll unregistered sales of equity securities during the period covered by this Annual Report were previously disclosed in our current reports on Form 8-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\nNot Applicable. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under Risk Factors and Uncertainties and elsewhere in this document. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements above.\nOverview\nWe are an exploration company, using tried and proven methods to search for gold, silver, and other metals as become indicated, on properties located in the State of Nevada in the Western United States. Our significant properties consist of our Eureka Projects (Lookout Mountain, Windfall, Oswego and other targets) in the Battle Mountain - Eureka Trend located in the North-Central portion of the state, and the Seven Troughs Project, located in the Northwest portion of the state.\nWe raised funds to acquire and explore these properties through private placements of our common stock and warrants with investors, through debt placements, and through joint venture arrangements with other mining exploration and development companies in our business sector. Our business plans employ strategies to locate and analyze gold and silver properties to determine the existence, quantity and quality of mineral deposits and advance those deposits for the benefit of our shareholders. We may seek to develop those properties ourselves or engage larger mining companies to purchase, develop, joint venture and otherwise exploit the properties for the purpose of production of these discovered precious metals.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we accomplished the following:\n1.\nWe closed a private placement of units of our equity for a total of approximately $4,340,000 cash;\n2.\nWe issued shares for exercise of warrants for a total of approximately $146,500;\n3.\nWe entered into an option with Normandy Gold which, if exercised in its entirety, would result in as much as a 75% joint venture interest for Normandy Gold in our Seven Troughs property. Full terms would include $5,000,000 invested by Normandy Gold in the property, 2,000,000 common shares of Normandy Gold issued to us and $250,000 cash paid to us, of which $50,000 has been received during the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2022;\n4.\nWe purchased six patented claims within a property known as New York Canyon for approximately $128,000; and\n5.\nWe reported the drilling results of the 2021-2022 exploration program.\nHighlights of the 2021-2022 exploration program completed during January 2022 include:\n\u00b7\nCompleted approximately 6,535m of drilling, 65% of which was reverse circulation (RC) drilling and 35% was diamond core drilling;\n\u00b7\nThe first results reported during the program were 5 RC holes completed in July 2021.

Highlights from the four new drill holes include:\n\u00b7\nBHSE-226C: 22.8m at 4.29 g/t gold from 339.9m depth,\no\nIncluding 7.6m at 11.56 g/t gold from 342.9m depth;\n\u00b7\nBHSE-224C: 30.5m at 2.56 g/t gold from 317.6m depth,\no\nincluding 18.4m at 3.80 g/t gold from 317.6m depth, and\n\u25a0\nincluding 3.35m at 13.36 g/t gold from 331.3m depth;\n\u00b7\nBHSE-223C: 39.0m at 1.71 g/t gold from 259.7m depth, including\no\n28.3m at 1.97 g/t gold from 259.7m depth, and\n\u25a0\nincluding 5.9m at 3.71 g/t gold from 259.7m depth;\n\u00b7\nBHSE-230C: 3.1m at 10.88 g/t gold from 288.6m depth; and\n\u00b7\nBHSE-230C: 8.7m at 2.01 g/t gold from 313.0m depth.\nSubsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2022, Timberline reported more results from the 2022 drilling program. Highlights from these holes include:\n\u00b7\nBHSE-238C: 16.8m at 2.64 g/t gold from 178.9m depth,\no\nincluding 4.6m at 4.45 g/t gold from 182.0m depth;\n\u00b7\nBHSE-221C: 6.1m at 1.83 g/t gold from 332.8m depth,\no\nincluding 1.5m at 3.59 g/t gold from 335.9m depth;\n\u00b7\nBHSE-239C: 9.4m at 1.09 g/t gold from 194.5m depth;\n\u00b7\nBHSE-239C: 6.1m at 1.33 g/t gold from 313.0m depth;\n\u00b7\nBHSE-239C: 3.1m at 3.77 g/t gold from 439.5m depth;\n\u00b7\nBHSE-221C: 35.1m at 10.1 g/t silver from 329.8m depth;\n\u00b7\nBHSE-237C: 79.2m at 8.2 g/t silver from 297.8m depth; and\n\u00b7\nBHSE-237C: 30.5m at 12.2 g/t silver from 393.8m depth.\nMaps, tables and figures in Part I of this Annual Report include these drilling results reported for the Companys fiscal year 2022.\nSummary of gold prices\nFiscal year 2022 has seen continuing strong trends in the gold price from a low of approximately $1,634 to a high of approximately $2,039 per ounce, with a trend moving around $1,643 per ounce at year end. We believe the global economic environment and monetary climate continue to favor a strong gold price for the foreseeable future. While volatility is to be expected, our expectation is that we can identify and pursue opportunities to advance our projects and take advantage of the current gold price and market volatility.\nExploration Plans and Budgets\nOur exploration focus during fiscal 2023 will continue to be on the Eureka Project. Our financial and human resources will be dedicated to the advancement of the Lookout Mountain, Water Well, Oswego, and other targets across the property. The results of our drilling, mapping, geochemical and geophysical work completed during fiscal years 2020 and 2021 exploration seasons significantly advanced our understanding of the overall geologic setting of the Eureka Project, highlighting several areas with potential for significant gold mineralization. The drilling results of fiscal 2022 significantly added to the geology and mineralization of our target areas in the Eureka Project and will guide our fiscal 2023 exploration plan.\nOur preliminary exploration budget for fiscal 2023 is expected to exceed $3.0 million, funded largely by our cash reserves and additional financing activities as we enter into the new 2023 calendar year. We have not yet received all the data from the 2022 work program, and those final results and the analysis thereof will factor heavily into our planning for fiscal 2023. Details of the exploration plan for later in fiscal 2023 will follow after our analysis of the results of the current drill program.\nResults of Operations for Years Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Results\nYear Ended September 30,\nExploration expenses:\nEureka/Lookout Mountain, net of non-cash expenses\n$ 4,614,490\n$ 2,795,753\nTotal exploration expenditures\n$ 4,614,490\n$ 2,795,753\nNon-cash expenses:\nStock option and stock issuance expense\n$ 44,321\n$ 646,422\nDepreciation, amortization, and accretion\n5,912\n5,632\nTotal non-cash expenses\n$ 50,233\n$ 652,054\nOperating expenses paid in cash:\nSalaries and benefits, net of non-cash expenses\n$ 293,097\n$ 293,137\nProfessional fees expense\n181,811\n205,068\nOther general and administrative expenses\n551,815\n529,641\nInterest and other (income) expense, net of non-cash expenses\n270,461\n232,162\nIncome tax provision (benefit)\n-\n-\nNet loss\n$ 5,961,907\n$ 4,707,815\nOur consolidated net loss for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 increased significantly from the prior year, primarily as a result of our increased exploration program, which included significant increases in drilling and geophysical activities. We also experienced significant decreases in shared-based compensation. Professional fees expenses were lower as a result of decreased utilization of financial professionals during fiscal 2022. General and administrative expenses increased as management executed on marketing, investor relations, and other programs that were not possible in previous years as placement funds became available to do so. Other expenses for fiscal 2022 were generally consistent with the prior year.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nAt September 30, 2022, we had assets of $16,972,229, consisting of cash of $2,438,587; property, mineral rights and equipment, net of depreciation, of $13,980,855, reclamation bonds of $528,643, and other assets in the amount of $24,144.\nOn September 30, 2022, we had total liabilities of $1,157,467 and total assets of $16,972,229. This compares to total liabilities of $570,144 and total assets of $17,716,406 on September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2022, our liabilities consist of $124,159 for asset retirement obligations, $270,991 of senior unsecured notes payable - related party, and $704,351 of trade payables and accrued expenses and $57,966 interest payable to a related party. Of these liabilities, $1,033,308 are due within 12 months. The increase in liabilities compared to September 30, 2021 is largely due to increased trade payables and accrued liabilities in 2022. Other liabilities were affected positively or negatively by individual small changes in other components of liabilities. The decrease in total current assets was due to an decrease in cash.\nOn September 30, 2022, we had working capital of $1,423,723 and stockholders equity of $15,814,762 compared to working capital of $3,170,019 and stockholders equity of $17,146,262 for the year ended September 30, 2021. Working capital experienced an unfavorable change because of a decrease in cash and an increase in trade payables, with other liabilities affected positively or negatively by individual small changes in other components of liabilities.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we used cash from operating activities of $5,325,134, compared to $4,263,754 used for fiscal 2021. There was a net loss of $5,961,907 for fiscal 2022 compared to a net loss of $4,707,815 for fiscal 2021. The causal factors are disclosed above in the comparative table and discussion above.\nAt the end of fiscal 2022, Timberline Resources Corp has accumulated approximately $52.6 million and $22.7 million in federal and state net operating losses, respectively, which may enable us to generate like amounts in net income prior to incurring any significant income tax obligation. Federal net operating losses of $44.8 million will expire in various amounts from 2024 through 2038, while $7.8 million do not expire and the usage of these loss carryforwards is limited to 80% of taxable income. The state net operating losses will expire in fiscal years ending September 30, 2023 through September 30, 2042.\nAdditionally, BH Minerals has total federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $25.5 million, of which $15.8 million expire in fiscal years ending September 30, 2025 through September 30, 2038. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $9.7 million will not expire and the usage of these loss carryforwards is limited to 80% of taxable income.\nAt September 30, 2022, the Company also has approximately $6.7 million in net operating loss carryforwards in Canada which will expire in fiscal years ending September 30, 2024 through September 30, 2032.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we used cash of $149,717 from investment activities, compared with cash used by investment activities of $13,430 in fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2022, we paid $209,770 to purchase mineral properties, while receiving a refund of reclamation bonds of $10,053, and a non-refundable payment per a memorandum of understanding for sale of mineral rights of $50,000. During fiscal 2021, we paid $92,000 to purchase mineral properties, while receiving $78,570 for lease payments to us for company-owned mineral properties\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, cash of $4,586,086 was provided by financing activities, compared to cash of $5,083,810 provided during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, cash of $4,439,587 was provided through the sale of stock, net of offering costs, and $146,499 was provided from exercise of warrants. This compares to cash of $4,475,818 provided through the sale of stock and warrants, net of offering costs, $637,001 was provided from exercise of warrants, reduced by $29,009 paid on debt for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021.\nGoing Concern:\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of our assets and the settlement of our liabilities in the normal course of our operations. Disruptions in the credit and financial markets over the past several years have had a material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and investors and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies. In addition, commodity prices and mining equities have seen significant volatility which increases the risk to precious metal investors. Market disruptions and alternative investment options, among other things, make it more difficult for us to obtain, or increase our cost of obtaining, capital and financing for our operations. Our access to additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to obtain financing through equity investments, we will seek multiple solutions including, but not limited to, asset sales, corporate transactions, credit facilities or debenture issuances in order to continue as a going concern.\nAt September 30, 2022, we had working capital of $1,423,723. We have $1,033,308 outstanding in current liabilities and a cash balance of $2,438,587. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have sufficient cash to meet our normal operating commitments for the next 12 months. Therefore, we do not expect to be required to engage in financial transactions to increase our cash balance or decrease our cash obligations in the near term. However, we are an exploration company with exploration programs that require significant cash expenditures. A significant drilling program, such are those we have planned, can result in in depletion of cash and return us to a position of insufficient cash to support normal operations for the following 12 months. Such cash-raising efforts may include equity financings, corporate transactions, joint venture agreements, sales of assets, credit facilities or debenture issuances, or other strategic transactions.\nThe audit opinion and notes that accompany our consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022 disclose a \u2018going concern qualification to our ability to continue in business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. We have incurred losses since our inception. We do not have sufficient cash to fund normal operations and meet all of our obligations for the next 12 months without deferring payment on certain current liabilities and/or raising additional funds. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. We believe that the going concern condition cannot be removed with confidence until the Company has entered into a business climate where funding of its activities is more assured. If the going concern basis were not appropriate for these financial statements, adjustments would be necessary in the carrying value of assets and liabilities, the reported expenses and the balance sheet classifications used.\nWe plan, as funding allows, to follow up on our positive drill results on our Eureka and Paiute Projects. Principally, we plan to execute drilling as part of the ongoing exploration program at Eureka. Also, subject to available capital, we may continue prudent exploration programs on our material exploration properties and/or fund some exploratory activities on early-stage properties.\nWe will require additional funding and/or reductions in exploration and administrative expenditures in future periods. Given current economic conditions, we cannot provide assurance that necessary financing transactions will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Without additional financing, we would have to curtail our exploration and other expenditures while we seek alternative funding arrangements to provide sufficient capital to meet our ongoing, non-discretionary expenditures, and maintain our primary mineral properties. If we cannot obtain sufficient additional financing, we may be unable to make required property payments on a timely basis and be forced to return some or all of our leased or optioned properties to the underlying owners.\nFinancing activities\nPrivate Placements:\nOn June 25, 2021, we closed on total subscriptions for a private placement offering for 23,070,798 units of the Company at a price of $0.20 per unit. Each unit consisted of one share of our common stock and one-half common share purchase Series M Warrant (each whole such warrant a Warrant), with each Warrant exercisable to acquire an additional share of our common stock at a price of $0.30 per share until the Warrant expiration date of May 31, 2023. A total of 23,070,798 shares and 11,535,399 Warrants issued for net proceeds of $4,475,818 to us, net of $138,342 finders fees. In addition, 596,248 Series M Warrants were issued for finders fees.\nOn May 2, 2022, we closed a non-brokered private placement of the Company to accredited investors at a price of $0.25 per common share. We issued 18,933,705 common shares for cash proceeds of $4,733,426. Finders fees in the amount of $293,839 and 1,016,022 Series N Warrants were paid and issued, respectively, to licensed brokers and consultants in association with the offering. The warrants have a term of 18 months and are exercisable at $0.25 per common share.\nThe private placement offerings were completed under Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, solely to persons who qualified as accredited investors. Subscribers who were resident in Canada were required to qualify as accredited investors under Canadian National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, liquidity, or capital expenditures.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a complete summary of the significant accounting policies used in the presentation of our financial statements. As described in Note 2, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. We believe that our most critical accounting estimates are related to asset impairments and asset retirement obligations.\nOur critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows:\nAsset Impairments\nSignificant property acquisition payments for active exploration properties and the fair value of equity instruments, including common shares and warrants, issued for properties are capitalized. The evaluation of our mineral properties for impairment is based on market conditions for minerals, underlying mineralized material associated with the properties, and future costs that may be required for ultimate realization through mining operations or by sale. If no mineable ore body is discovered, or market conditions for minerals deteriorate, there is the potential for a material adjustment to the value assigned to mineral properties.\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment or abandonment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, the manner in which the asset is used, and the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe have an obligation to reclaim our properties after the surface has been disturbed by exploration methods at the site. As a result, we have recorded a liability for the fair value of the reclamation costs we expect to incur in association with our Eureka Property. We estimate applicable inflation and credit-adjusted risk-free rates, as well as expected reclamation time frames. To the extent that the estimated reclamation costs change, such changes will impact future reclamation expense recorded. A liability is recognized for the present value of estimated environmental remediation (asset retirement obligation) in the period in which the liability is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The offsetting balance is charged to the related long-lived asset. Adjustments are made to the liability for changes resulting from passage of time and changes to either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate underlying the obligation. ITEM 7A.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTIMBERLINE RESOURCES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2022 and 2021\nTimberline Resources Corporation and Subsidiaries\nContents\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nConsolidated balance sheets\nConsolidated statements of operations\nConsolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity\nConsolidated statements of cash flows\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n70-79\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nTimberline Resources Corporation\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Timberline Resources Corporation (the \"Company\") as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nThe Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has accumulated losses since inception. This factor raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\nAssure CPA, LLC\nWe have served as the Companys independent auditor since 2006.\nSpokane, Washington\nDecember 29, 2022\nFirm ID: 444\nTIMBERLINE RESOURCES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash\n$ 2,438,587\n$ 3,327,352\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n18,444\n23,573\nTOTAL CURRENT ASSETS\n2,457,031\n3,350,925\nPROPERTY, MINERAL RIGHTS, AND EQUIPMENT, net (NOTE 3)\n13,980,855\n13,821,085\nOTHER ASSETS:\nReclamation bonds\n528,643\n538,696\nDeposits and other assets\n5,700\n5,700\nTOTAL OTHER ASSETS\n534,343\n544,396\nTOTAL ASSETS\n$ 16,972,229\n$ 17,716,406\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nAccounts payable\n$ 639,994\n$ 114,819\nAccrued expenses\n22,214\n23,749\nAccrued interest - related party (NOTE 5)\n57,966\n4,145\nAccrued payroll, benefits and taxes\n42,143\n38,193\nSenior unsecured note payable - related party (NOTE 5)\n270,991\n-\nTOTAL CURRENT LIABILITIES\n1,033,308\n180,906\nLONG-TERM LIABILITIES:\nAsset retirement obligation\n124,159\n118,247\nSenior unsecured note payable - related party (NOTE 5)\n-\n270,991\nTOTAL LONG-TERM LIABILITIES\n124,159\n389,238\nTOTAL LIABILITIES\n1,157,467\n570,144\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (NOTES 5 and 10)\n-\n-\nSTOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY: (NOTE 8)\nPreferred stock, $ 0.01 par value;

In 2008, the Company reincorporated into the State of Delaware, pursuant to a merger agreement approved by its shareholders.\nTimberline Resources, together with its consolidated entities, is a mineral exploration business and, if and when we establish mineral reserves, a development company. Mineral exploration is essentially a research activity that does not produce a product. Successful exploration often results in increased project value that can be realized through the optioning or selling of the claimed site to larger companies. We have acquired properties which we believe have potential to host economic concentrations of minerals, particularly gold and silver. These acquisitions have and may take the form of unpatented mining claims on federal land, or leasing claims on private property owned by others. An unpatented mining claim is an interest that can be acquired in the mineral rights on open lands of the federally-owned public domain.\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:\na.\nBasis of Presentation and Going Concern - This summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding the financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Companys management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred losses since its inception. The Company has sufficient cash to fund normal operations and meet all of its obligations for the next 12 months without raising additional funds. However, we are an exploration company with exploration programs that require significant cash expenditures. A significant drilling program, such are those we have planned, can result in depletion of cash and return us to a position of insufficient cash to support normal operations for 12 months. The Company currently has no historical recurring source of revenue, and its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to raise equity and/or debt capital to fund future exploration and working capital requirements, or the Companys ability to profitably execute its business plan. The Companys plans for the long-term return to and continuation as a going concern include financing its future operations through sales of common stock and/or debt and the eventual profitable exploitation of its mining properties. While the Company has been successful in the past in obtaining financing, there is no assurance that it will be able to obtain adequate financing in the future or that such financing will be on terms acceptable to the Company. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. If the going concern basis were not appropriate for these financial statements, adjustments would be necessary in the carrying value of assets and liabilities, the reported expenses and the balance sheet classifications used.\nb.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements - In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2020-06 Debt - Debt With Conversion And Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) And Derivatives And Hedging - Contracts In Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting For Convertible Instruments And Contracts In An Entitys Own Equity. The update simplifies the accounting for and disclosures related to company debt that is convertible or can be settled in a companys own equity securities. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted the update effective October 1, 2021, which had no impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nc.\nPrinciples of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, BH Minerals USA, Inc.; Lookout Mountain LLC; Wolfpack Gold (Nevada) Corp.; Staccato Gold Resources, Ltd.; and Talapoosa Development Corp., after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.\nTimberline Resources Corporation\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nd.\nProperty and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which ranges from two to seven years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Significant improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the useful life of the assets. Gains or losses on disposition or retirement of property and equipment are recognized in operating expenses.\ne.\nMineral Rights, Capitalization and Exploration Expenditures - All exploration expenditures are expensed as incurred. Significant property acquisition payments for exploration properties are capitalized. If no mineable ore body is discovered, the Company determines to focus its exploration efforts elsewhere, claims fees and holding fees are not remitted, or for other reasons, previously capitalized costs are expensed in the period the property is abandoned. When it is determined that a mineral deposit can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, the costs incurred after such determination will be capitalized and amortized over their useful lives. To date, the Company has not established the commercial feasibility of its exploration prospects; therefore, all exploration costs are being expensed. When a mineral property is sold or abandoned, the net of the sales price of the property and its carrying cost are recognized as a gain or loss on sale or abandonment on the Statement of Operations.\nf.\nProperty Holding Costs - Holding costs to maintain a property, excluding mineral lease payments, are expensed in the period they are incurred. These costs include security and maintenance expenses, claim fees and payments, and environmental monitoring and reporting costs.\ng.\nFair Value Measurements - When required to measure assets or liabilities at fair value, the Company uses a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used. The Company determines the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall. The categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Level 1 uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, Level 2 uses significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 uses significant unobservable inputs. The amount of the total gains or losses for the period are included in earnings that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those recurring assets and liabilities still held at the reporting date.\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no assets or liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis or nonrecurring basis. The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including senior unsecured note payable - related party, approximate fair value at September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nh.\nCash Equivalents - For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Balances are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000 for accounts at each financial institution.\nI.\nReclamation Bonds - Bonds paid to assure reclamation of properties covered by exploration permits are capitalized in the period paid, reduced as refunds are received or expensed as they are applied to reclamation obligations.\nj.\nEstimates and Assumptions - The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant areas requiring the use of management assumptions and estimates relate to long-lived asset impairments, asset retirement obligations, and stock-based compensation. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material effect on the Companys reported financial position and results of operations.\nk.\nAccounting for Investments in Joint Ventures -Investments in companies and joint ventures in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In determining whether significant influence exists, the Company considers its participation in policy-making decisions and representation on governing bodies. Under the equity method of accounting, our share of the net earnings or losses of the investee are included in net income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate equity method investments whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired. If a decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. The Company has no investments accounted for under the equity method.\nThe Company recognizes as income funds that are received from distributions from net accumulated earnings of the joint venture. For joint ventures where the Company holds more than 50% of the voting interest and has significant influence, the joint venture is consolidated with the presentation of a non-controlling interest. In determining whether significant influence exists, the Company considers its participation in policy-making decisions and its representation on the ventures management committee. The Company has no significant influence over its joint ventures, and therefore accounts for its investment using the cost less impairment basis.\nThe Company periodically assesses its investments in joint ventures for impairment. If management determines that a decline in fair value is other than temporary it will write-down the investment and charge the impairment against operations.\nTimberline Resources Corporation\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nl. Asset Impairments - Carrying Value of Property, Mineral Rights and Equipment - The Company reviews the carrying value of property, mineral rights, and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the related assets. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, the manner in which the property is used, the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors.\nm.\nAsset Retirement Obligations - Guidance provided by GAAP states that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) will be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and a contractual obligation exists. An ARO asset is capitalized as part of the carrying value of the assets to which it is associated, and depreciated over the useful life of the asset. Adjustments are made to the liability for changes resulting from passage of time and changes to either the timing or amount of the original estimate underlying the obligation. The Company has an asset retirement obligation associated with its exploration program at the Lookout Mountain Target on its Eureka Project, and its Paiute Project.\nn.\nProvision for Income Taxes - Income taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting. Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end. A valuation allowance is recorded against the deferred tax asset, if management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized (see Note 7).\nUncertain tax positions are evaluated in a two-step process, whereby (i) it is determined whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority would be recognized.\no.\nTranslation of Foreign Currencies - All amounts in the financial statements are presented in US dollars, and the US dollar is the Companys functional currency. The Company has a Canadian subsidiary, but this subsidiary has no operations, assets, or liabilities in Canada for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The US-based operations of the Company incur certain expenses in Canada, and the foreign translation and transaction gains and losses relating to such expenses incurred in Canada have been included in the Companys net loss as a component of other income (expense).\np.\nStock-based Compensation - The Company estimates the fair value of its stock-based option compensation, and warrants when issued, using the Black-Scholes model, which requires the input of some subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected life), the estimated volatility of the Companys common stock price over the expected term (volatility), employee forfeiture rate, the risk-free interest rate and the dividend yield. Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation. Options that are forfeited or expired are returned to the pool of options available for grant with no effect on the Companys Statement of operations, but fair values are reduced from deferred share-based compensation in the calculation of current or deferred income tax assets or obligations.\nThe fair value of common stock awards is determined based upon the closing price of the Companys stock on the grant date of the award. Compensation expense for grants that vest is recognized ratably over the vesting period.\nq.\nNet Income (Loss) per Share - Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed as net income (loss) available to common shareholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through stock options, warrants, and other convertible securities.\nTimberline Resources Corporation\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe dilutive effect of convertible and outstanding securities as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\nStock options\n8,335,000\n8,335,000\nWarrants\n57,414,898\n74,216,319\nTotal potential dilution\n65,749,898\n82,551,319\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, the effect of the Companys common stock equivalents would have been anti-dilutive. Accordingly, only basic EPS is presented.\nNOTE 3 - PROPERTY, MINERAL RIGHTS AND EQUIPMENT:\nThe following is a summary of property, mineral rights, equipment and accumulated depreciation at September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nExpected\nUseful Lives\n(years)\nMineral rights - Eureka\n-\n$ 13,786,608\n$ 13,704,608\nMineral rights - Seven Troughs, New York Canyon and other\n-\n142,770\n65,000\nTotal mineral rights\n13,929,378\n13,769,608\nEquipment and vehicles\n2-5\n53,678\n53,678\nOffice equipment and furniture\n3-7\n70,150\n70,150\nLand\n-\n51,477\n51,477\nTotal property and equipment\n175,305\n175,305\nLess accumulated depreciation\n(123,828 )\n(123,828 )\nProperty, mineral rights, and equipment, net\n$ 13,980,855\n$ 13,821,085\nDepreciation expense for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, was $ 0 for each period.\nThe Company received lease payments from a third party in two of the Companys historical leases on the Eureka property. The total amount of these payments received for the years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 was $-0- and $78,570, respectively. The lease terms were modified during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, and the payments ceased. These receipts were recorded as a reduction to the carrying amount of the mineral rights.\nSeven Troughs:\nIn its fiscal 2012, Timberline announced the acquisition from CIT Microprobe Holdings, LLC (California Institute of Technology) (CIT) of CITs interest in 3,900 acres (6.1 square miles) of patented and unpatented mining claims comprising the majority of the Seven Troughs gold mining district near Lovelock, Nevada. The acquired interest is as lessee under the terms of a 50-year lease, originally executed in 1975. Terms of the purchase agreement included a cash payment of $50,000 and a 2-percent NSR production royalty reserved to CIT. While the Company is certain of its rights and obligations under the lease, the lessors identification became somewhat clouded over the years due to passing of the early lessor principal to the agreement and a lack of full clarity as to all the eventual inheritors of the property. The Company has met its obligations under the lease and has located and secured agreements with the heirs to acquire any of their residual rights. The Company is moving to have the agreements adjudicated appropriately. The Company has the option to purchase one-half of the NSR production royalty for $1 million.\nOn April 26, 2022, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with Normandy Gold Limited (NDY) to grant NDY a 12-month exclusive option to enter into an earn-in joint venture agreement with the Company regarding the Seven Troughs property.

Mr. Matlack loaned the Company $300,000 in the form of a senior unsecured note, with the principal bearing interest at an annual rate of 18%, compounded monthly. The loan is unsecured and has a maturity date of January 20, 2023. During fiscal 2021, the Company repaid $29,009 of principal along with $220,991 of interest. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the note payable balance was $270,991 and $270,991, respectively, with all of the discount fully amortized.\nThe accrued interest on the senior unsecured note payable - related party was $57,966 and $4,145 at September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. Interest expense related to the senior unsecured note payable to this related party was $55,660 and $82,643 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe $270,991 senior unsecured note payable would be senior to any other debt obtained by the Company subsequent to September 30, 2021. The note requires that when the Company enters into any other financings, 25% of the proceeds of such financings will be paid toward reduction of the principal and interest accrued on this note. At May 2, 2022 and continuing through September 30, 2022, the Mr. Matlack provided a waiver of default on the note that would otherwise have existed due to a non-payment of cash from sales of common stock for cash under this contract term for the note.\nNOTE 6 - ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION:\nRemediation, reclamation and mine closure costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. Management estimates costs associated with reclamation of mining properties as well as remediation costs for inactive properties. The Company uses assumptions about future costs, capital costs and reclamation costs. Such assumptions are based on the Companys current mining plan and the best available information for making such estimates.\nOn an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual amounts could differ from those based on such estimates and assumptions. Changes to the Companys asset retirement obligation on its mineral properties are as follows:\nBeginning balance\n$ 118,247\n$ 112,615\nAccretion expense\n5,912\n5,632\nEnding balance\n$ 124,159\n$ 118,247\nManagements evaluation of the ARO at September 30, 2022 and 2021, did not indicate that a revision to the ARO was needed.\nNOTE 7 - INCOME TAXES:\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not record a tax provision or benefit due to continuing losses and availability of net operating loss carry forwards.\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had deferred tax assets arising principally from net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes. As the Companys management cannot determine that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefit of the net deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance equal to 100% of the net deferred tax asset has been recorded at September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nThe components of the Companys deferred taxes at September 30, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nTimberline Resources Corp.\nNet deferred tax assets:\nExploration costs\n$ 127,000\n$ 130,000\nInvestments in subsidiaries\n184,000\n184,000\nShare-based compensation\n362,000\n350,000\nFederal and state net operating loss carryforwards\n12,163,000\n11,752,000\nForeign net operating loss carryforwards\n1,803,000\n1,803,000\nTotal deferred tax asset\n14,639,000\n14,219,000\nValuation allowance\n(14,639,000 )\n(14,219,000 )\nNet deferred tax asset\n$ -\n$ -\nBH Minerals USA, Inc.\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities):\nProperty, mineral rights, and equipment\n$ (2,260,000 )\n$ (2,261,000 )\nExploration costs\n255,000\n296,000\nFederal and state net operating loss carryforwards\n5,353,000\n4,425,000\nTotal deferred tax asset\n3,348,000\n2,460,000\nValuation allowance\n(3,348,000 )\n(2,460,000 )\nNet deferred tax asset\n$ -\n$ -\nTimberline Resources Corporation\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe federal income taxes of the Companys wholly owned subsidiary, BH Minerals USA, Inc., are not consolidated with those of the rest of the Company since BH Minerals USA, Inc. is wholly owned by the Companys Canadian subsidiary, Staccato Gold Resources Ltd.\nThe annual tax benefit is different from the amount that would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to the Companys pretax loss for the following reasons:\nNet Loss\n$ (5,962,000 )\n$ (4,708,000 )\nStatutory Federal income tax rate\n21.0 %\n21.0 %\nExpected income tax benefit based on statutory rate\n(1,252,000 )\n(989,000 )\nEffect of state taxes\n(61,000 )\n(98,000 )\nEffect of change in tax rates\n-\n(67,000 )\nChange in valuation allowance\n1,308,000\n(346,000 )\nExpiration of stock options in prior years\n-\n1,277,000\nPrior year change in estimates\n5,000\n223,000\nIncome tax provision\n$ -\n$ -\nAt September 30, 2022, Timberline Resources Corp had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $52.6 million, of which $44.8 million expire in fiscal years ending September 30, 2024 through September 30, 2038. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $7.8 million will not expire and the usage of these loss carryforwards is limited to 80% of taxable income. State net operating losses total approximately $22.7 million and will expire in fiscal years ending September 30, 2023 through September 30, 2042.\nBH Minerals has total federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $25.5 million, of which $15.8 million expire in fiscal years ending September 30, 2025 through September 30, 2038.

If interest and penalties were to be assessed, the Company would charge interest to interest expense, and penalties to other operating expense. Fiscal years 2019 through 2022 remain subject to examination by state and federal tax authorities. The Company has reviewed its tax returns and believes the Company has not taken any unsubstantiated tax positions.\nIRS Code Section 382 limits the loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change of a corporation. The equity placement activities during the year ended September 30, 2022 did not give rise to an ownership change under Section 382.\nAs a result of previous acquisitions, the Company acquired approximately $15,000,000 of federal net operating loss carryovers that are limited by Code Section 382. As of September 30, 2022, the Company has not determined if any other losses are limited by IRS Code Section 382.\nNOTE 8 - COMMON STOCK, WARRANTS AND PREFERRED STOCK:\nAt the Annual General Meeting of shareholders held on April 14, 2021, the shareholders approved an increase in the number of authorized common shares of the Company from 200,000,000 to 500,000,000, with no change in par value and no split or other modification to any outstanding shares. The Certificate of Incorporation of the Company in the State of Delaware was amended to reflect that change in October 2021.\nPrivate Placements\nOn June 25, 2021, the Company closed on total subscriptions for a private placement offering for 23,070,798 units of the Company at a price of $0.20 per unit.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nConclusions of Management Regarding Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAt the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a - 15(e) and Rule 15d - 15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, it was concluded that our disclosure controls were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report, to ensure that: (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within required time periods specified by the Securities & Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (ii) material information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decision regarding required disclosure.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. This internal control system has been designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of the Companys published financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nOur management has assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. To make this assessment, we used the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of September 30, 2021, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is not effective, due to the current inability to segregate duties inherent with limited staffing.\nManagements Remediation Initiatives\nManagements remediation initiatives included implementing additional controls over cash receipt and payment transactions through reviews and approvals performed by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. These detective controls significantly mitigate segregation of duties issues that exist by one person having the ability to enter payments and receipts into the accounting software, process payment and deposits into the accounting software and reconciling bank statements. The Company has three employees, and management has concluded that anticipated business growth and the accompanying expansion of staffing will improve effectiveness of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no material change in internal control over financial reporting in the quarter ended September 30, 2022.

The policy requires review, approval or ratification of all transactions in which we are a participant and in which any of our directors, executive officers, significant stockholders or an immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons has a direct or indirect material interest, subject to certain categories of transactions that are deemed to be pre-approved under the policy - including employment of executive officers, director compensation (in general, where such transactions are required to be reported in our proxy statement pursuant to SEC compensation disclosure requirements), as well as certain transactions where the amounts involved do not exceed specified thresholds. All related party transactions must be reported for review by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors pursuant to the Audit Committees charter and the rules of the NYSE American.\nFollowing its review, the Audit Committee determines whether these transactions are in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, taking into consideration whether they are on terms no less favorable to the Company than those available with other parties and the related person's interest in the transaction. If a related party transaction is to be ongoing, the Audit Committee may establish guidelines for the Company's management to follow in its ongoing dealings with the related person.\nOur policy for review of transactions with related persons was followed in all of the transactions set forth above and all such transactions were reviewed and approved in accordance with our policy for review of transactions with related persons.\nDirector Independence\nWe have five directors as of December 20, 2022, including two independent directors, as follows:\n\u00b7\nLeigh Freeman\n\u00b7\nPamela Saxton\nAn independent director is a director whom the Board of Directors has determined satisfies the requirements for independence under Section 803A of the NYSE American Company Guide.
