Business.\nAdditional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\" (MD&A); and Notes 1 and 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms Energizer, the Company, we, us or our in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we mean Energizer Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, unless we state or the context implies otherwise.\nEnergizer, through its operating subsidiaries, is a global diversified household products leader in batteries, auto care and portable lights. Energizer is one of the worlds largest manufacturers, marketers and distributors of household and specialty batteries; automotive appearance, performance, refrigerant and freshener products; and portable lights. Information about our legal separation from our former parent company, recent acquisitions and divestment can be found in the MD&A and Notes 1, 4 and 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEnergizer is the beneficiary of over 100 years of expertise in the battery and portable lighting products industries and is recognized worldwide for innovation, quality and dependability across its brands which include Energizer\u00ae, Eveready\u00ae and Rayovac\u00ae brands which are marketed and sold around the world.\nEnergizer's shares of common stock are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"ENR.\"\nWe use the Energizer name and logo as our trademark as well as those of our subsidiaries. Product names appearing throughout are trademarks of Energizer. This section also may refer to brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names of other companies and organizations, and these brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names are the property of their respective owners.\nUnless indicated otherwise, the information concerning our industry contained in this Annual Report is based on Energizers general knowledge of and expectations concerning the industry. Energizers market position, market share and industry market size are based on estimates using Energizers internal data and estimates, based on data from various industry analyses, its internal research and adjustments and assumptions that it believes to be reasonable. Energizer has not independently verified data from industry analyses and cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness. In addition, Energizer believes that data regarding the industry, market size and its market position and market share within such industry provide general guidance but are inherently imprecise. Further, Energizers estimates and assumptions involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors section. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the estimates and assumptions.\nNarrative Description of the Business\nOur Products\nEnergizer offers household batteries including primary, rechargeable, specialty and hearing aid using many technologies including lithium, alkaline, carbon zinc, nickel metal hydride, zinc air, and silver oxide. These products are sold globally under the Energizer, Eveready and Rayovac brands, including hearing aid batteries, and the Varta\u00ae brand in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Our portfolio spans the performance, premium and price segments.\nIn addition, we offer auto care products in the appearance, fragrance, performance, and air conditioning recharge product categories. The appearance and fragrance categories include protectants, wipes, tire and wheel care products, glass cleaners, leather care products, air fresheners and washes designed to clean, shine, refresh, disinfect and protect interior and exterior automobile surfaces under the brand names Armor All\u00ae, Nu Finish\u00ae, Refresh Your Car!\u00ae, LEXOL\u00ae, Eagle One\u00ae, California Scents\u00ae, Driven\u00ae, Bahama & Co\u00ae, Carnu\u00ae , Grand Prix\u00ae , Kit\u00ae and Tempo\u00ae.\nThe performance product category includes STP\u00ae-branded fuel and oil additives, functional fluids and other performance chemical products that benefit from a rich heritage in the car enthusiast and racing scenes, characterized by a commitment to technology, performance and motor sports partnerships for over 60 years. The brand equity of STP also provides for attractive licensing opportunities that augment our presence in our core performance categories.\nThe air conditioning recharge product category includes do-it-yourself automotive air conditioning recharge products led by the A/C PRO\u00ae brand name, along with other refrigerant and recharge kits, sealants and accessories.\nIn addition, we offer an extensive line of lighting products designed to meet a variety of consumer needs. We distribute, and market lighting products including handheld, headlights, lanterns, and area lights. In addition to the Energizer, Eveready and Rayovac brands, we market our flashlights under the Hard Case\u00ae, Dolphin\u00ae, and WeatherReady\u00ae sub-brands. In addition to batteries and portable lights, Energizer licenses the Energizer, Eveready and Rayovac brands to companies developing consumer solutions in solar, automotive batteries, portable power for critical devices (like smart phones), generators, power tools, household light bulbs and other lighting products.\nAdditional information about our products can be found in MD&A in Part II, Item 7 of this Report, and Note 3, Revenue, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur Industry\nWe are a branded manufacturing and distribution company that markets and sells in the battery, auto care and portable lights categories. These categories are highly competitive, both in the U.S. and on a global basis. We invest in our brands and innovation to meet the needs of consumers, and with our large global footprint, we both manufacture and source our products. Competition within our categories is based upon brand perceptions, product performance, price, retail execution and customer service. Key drivers of the battery business are device usage, consumer demographics and disasters and key drivers for the auto care business are size and age of car parc and miles driven. Competition in this category remains aggressive in the U.S. and other markets and could continue to put additional pressure on our results going forward, particularly as consumers shift consumption between channels such as e-commerce and discounters.\nSales and Distribution\nWe distribute our products to consumers through numerous retail locations worldwide, including mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs, food, drug and convenience stores, electronics specialty stores and department stores, hardware and automotive centers, e-commerce and military stores. Although a large percentage of our sales are attributable to a relatively small number of retail customers, in fiscal year 2022, only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounted for ten percent or more (12.9%) of the Company's annual sales.\nOur products are marketed primarily through a direct sales force, but also through exclusive and non-exclusive distributors and wholesalers. Our products are sold through both modern and traditional trade. Modern trade, which is most prevalent in North America, Western Europe, and more developed economies throughout the world, generally refers to sales through large retailers with nationally or regionally recognized brands. Traditional trade, which is more common in developing markets in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, generally refers to sales by wholesalers or small retailers who may not have a national or regional presence.\nAdditional information can be found in the MD&A and Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 3, Revenue, of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSources and Availability of Raw Materials\nThe principal raw materials used by Energizer in the production of batteries and lighting products include electrolytic manganese dioxide, zinc, silver, nickel, lithium, graphite, steel, plastic, brass wire, and potassium hydroxide. The principal raw material used by auto care is refrigerant R-134a, plastic, silicone, steel and aluminum. The prices and availability of these raw materials have fluctuated over time. We believe that adequate supplies of most raw materials and component parts required for all of our operations are available at the present time, although we cannot predict their future availability or prices. Our raw materials and component parts are generally available from a number of different sources, and are susceptible to currency fluctuations and price fluctuations due to supply and demand, transportation, government regulations, price controls, tariffs, economic climate, or other unforeseen circumstances like force majeure. We have not experienced any significant interruption in availability of raw materials as our supply chain begins to normalize. We continue to work to qualify additional sources to ensure continuity and resiliency of supply for these items. We believe we have extensive experience in purchasing raw materials in the commodity markets. From time to time, our management has purchased materials or entered into forward commitments for raw materials to assure supply and to protect margins on anticipated sales volume.\nOur Trademarks, Patents and Technology\nOur ability to compete effectively in the battery, auto care and portable lights categories depends, in part, on our ability to protect our brands and maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies and manufacturing processes through a combination of trademark, patent and trade secret protection. We own thousands of Energizer, Rayovac, and Eveready trademarks globally, and license Varta trademarks, which we consider to be of substantial importance and which are used individually or in conjunction with other sub-brand names. The number of Energizer, Rayovac, Eveready, Energizer Bunny, and Mr. Energizer trademarks, including related designs, slogans and sub-brands, is currently over 2,800 worldwide.\nIn our auto care business, we also have the Refresh Your Car!, California Scents, Driven, Bahama & Co., LEXOL, Eagle One, Armor All, STP, Tuff Stuff, Kent Car Care, A/C Pro and the Nu Finish trademarks, and we recently expanded our portfolio in Latin America to add the Carnu, Grand Prix, Kit and Tempo trademarks. The number of trademarks making up the total of the auto care trademark portfolio globally, including related designs, slogans, and sub-brands, is nearly over 1,900 worldwide.\nWe also own a number of patents, patent applications and other technology that relate primarily to battery, automotive fragrance, performance and appearance products and portable lights, which we believe are significant to our business.\nSeasonality\nSales and operating profit for our business tends to be seasonal, with increased purchases by consumers and increases in retailer inventories occurring for batteries during our fiscal first quarter and for automotive fragrance, appearance, performance and air conditioning recharge products during our fiscal second and third quarters. In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes can create conditions that drive short-term increases in the need for portable power and lighting products and thereby increase our battery and flashlight sales. As a result of this seasonality, our inventory and working capital needs fluctuate throughout the year.\nHuman Capital Resources\nPurpose and Values\nEnergizer is led by our purpose to responsibly create products that make lives easier and more enjoyable.\nLaunched in fiscal 2022, Energizer 2.0 is a new vision for powering our future. It reflects a commitment to growing as both a business and a global corporate citizen. Our values are the foundation for everything we do and are essential to fulfilling our mission of being the leader in our categories by better serving consumers and customers:\nWe Win Together. We relentlessly pursue our goals. We celebrate and move to the next challenge. We act with urgency because windows of opportunity close quickly. We are focused on results.\nWhile Serving Each Other. We care for others success as much as we do our own. We challenge respectfully to drive better outcomes and work collectively across functions, levels and geographies to achieve our goals. All for one, one for all.\nWith A Willingness to Act Boldly. We push forward rather than leaning back. We take chances, have a bias for action and go all in to achieve our goals. Even if we fail, we fail together. We are transparent, we learn from it, and are better for it. We are fearlessly determined.\nAll While Doing Right. We bring out the best in each other to bring the best to our consumers and customers. We are vulnerable and trust each other with our imperfections. By being inclusive and open, our diverse perspectives amplify what we can achieve. Doing the right thing is all we know.\nEmployees\nAs of September 30, 2022, we have approximately 5,500 employees located across 36 countries, including approximately 2,200 employees based in North America, 1,800 employees in Asia Pacific, 900 employees in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and 600 employees in Latin America. Approximately 440 employees are unionized, primarily at our Fennimore, Wisconsin; Portage, Wisconsin; and Marietta, Ohio, facilities. We consider our employee relations to be good.\nGovernance\nEnergizer believes that strong governance principles, policies and practices contribute to better results for our shareholders. We are proud to have a diverse and independent board of directors with the skills, experience and perspectives to help chart the course of our global company.\nThe Human Capital Committee oversees company policies and practices related to human capital management, including those related to our culture, diversity and inclusion efforts, and rewards and compensation programs. Under the leadership of our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Human Capital Officer is responsible for developing and executing key aspects of our human capital strategy, including the attraction, development, retention, and engagement of talent to deliver on the Companys strategy and the design of competitive compensation and employee benefit programs.\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging\nAt Energizer, diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (DEIB) is a business imperative that requires active engagement from all of our leaders and colleagues. We strive to foster an inclusive and diverse workplace culture where colleagues feel a sense of belonging, feel listened to, are included in discussions and are valued for their contributions.\nIn fiscal 2022, Energizer appointed a Global Director of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging, who is leading and advancing our global DEIB efforts. This year, we focused on the following strategic priorities:\nCommunity: Promoting a workplace where all colleagues feel safe to express their perspectives and feel they belong to our Energizer team;\nLearning: Building colleague awareness and understanding to produce respectful and inclusive workplace behaviors and actions; and\nTalent: Embracing diversity to attract, recruit, develop and retain top talent.\nOur recruitment strategies are designed to ensure a diverse pipeline of candidates to meet the needs of our business today and in the future. Energizer has taken steps to enhance its talent acquisition process across the organization, including by implementing diversity training for recruiters, interview skills training for colleagues and processes to improve our candidate attraction, selection and onboarding so we can welcome diverse colleagues to our company. We continually assess our talent guidelines and decisions to ensure fair and objective hiring practices.\nIn fiscal 2022, our Global DEIB Council, which is sponsored by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Human Capital Officer, continued to provide strategic oversight of, and facilitate business alignment with, Energizers DEIB activities. Energizer has offered a series of diversity and inclusion-related trainings including Inclusive Mindset for Committed Allies and Unconscious Bias. Completion rates for the Inclusive Mindset for Committed Allies training program was over 95% for salaried colleagues. In fiscal 2022, we also continued to publish stories written in partnership with our diverse colleagues, who shared their experiences with our organization to help build our internal community and appreciate our differences. Looking into the future, we are developing a comprehensive DEIB learning plan, with training topics that align with our desired workplace culture, for all colleague levels.\nEnergizer is proud to have three employee resource groups-the Womens Leadership Network (WLN), the African Ancestry Leadership Group, and Mosaic (the Asian-American Ancestry Group)-that help increase visibility and advancement of diverse colleagues. By embracing our colleagues diverse cultures, experiences and ways of thinking, we believe that we will deliver better business results and have a more engaged workforce.\nResults-Driven, Collaborative Culture\nEnergizer colleagues are dedicated to working together to win. We learn together, care about each other and do the right thing to achieve our goals. We strive to build a culture that will propel our business forward and create a vibrant future for our brands, products, customers, consumers, shareholders, and colleagues. Our culture champion network, with 70 members across our business, leads local and global efforts to create inclusive work environments. Through virtual meetings and global events, we strive to bring our colleagues together to help create a sense of community and belonging across our locations worldwide.\nFrom town halls and leadership forums to engagement surveys conducted through a third-party partner we seek out colleague feedback and take action to improve our culture and the employee experience. Our fiscal 2022 engagement score was 76 with an 80% global colleague response rate, both of which exceeded the global benchmarks from our third-party survey provider. We have taken strides to improve our awareness of what drives engagement and the role each colleague plays in improving engagement. We do this by providing and sharing online learning resources through the engagement platform for teams to leverage as they review their results and develop their action plans.\nWe are committed to colleague recognition, which includes acknowledging, appreciating and celebrating each others contributions and achievements. In fiscal 2022 Energizer launched a new global recognition platform called Celebrate that allows us to honor colleagues service anniversaries and other special events. Celebrate also serves as an improved platform for our CEO Award, which rewards and recognizes both teams and individual colleagues who have made significant and notable contributions to Energizers success.\nTalent Development\nEngaged, driven and productive colleagues are essential to achieving growth. All colleagues participate in annual training focused on topics related to ethics, compliance, inclusion, belonging and diversity. For salaried colleagues, we offer a catalog featuring in excess of 2,000 online courses from IT skills to business acumen and leadership skills, along with an online competency model library and supporting training resources. Specific skills-based training is provided to colleagues within their function, to ensure they understand and master necessary job skills and requirements and have access to developmental opportunities. We also encourage career development through individual development planning, formal mentoring programs, team effectiveness workshops, project and change management training and leadership development programs. For hourly colleagues, we conduct annual safety, health and environmental training as well as equipment and other job-relevant training. Colleagues are encouraged to communicate their career interests to their manager and have access to our career center to view available positions.\nPay\nOur primary compensation strategy is to pay for performance on both a long-term and annual basis, which helps drive a mindset of accountability and productivity and aligns the interests of our colleagues with our shareholders. Our compensation guiding principles are to structure compensation that is simple, aligned and balanced. We believe our compensation guiding principles are strongly aligned with our corporate strategic priorities and our vision for shareholder value creation.\nWe deliver market-competitive total rewards packages for our colleagues. As part of our commitment to fair pay, we strive to be externally competitive while keeping in mind internal equity across our organization. Pay for performance is our fundamental reward philosophy. We reward and recognize both individual and team results relative to our business goals and commitment to shareholders, as well as behaviors that align with our culture statement. We are committed to fair pay and strive to be externally competitive while ensuring internal equity across our organization. We conduct global pay equity assessments and compensation reviews. We strive to reduce unconscious biases and structural barriers in our hiring practices, performance reviews, promotional guidelines and leadership opportunities that may contribute to pay inequities.\nWorkplace Safety\nEnergizer maintains a global safety, health and environmental (SHE) policy designed to help ensure a safe workplace for our colleagues. Because providing products and services to our customers with zero harm to people and the environment is our goal, we require all colleagues and contractors at our plants and manufacturing facilities to understand and follow our global SHE policy, and we retrain them on this policy on an annual basis. Each facility also maintains additional safety policies, measures and procedures specific to its individual needs. Our occupational health and safety management system is aimed at addressing three key components of safety:\nIdentifying the root cause of safety hazards in our operations;\nAssessing risks associated with all hazards or conditions identified; and\nMitigating risks associated with known hazards and conditions.\nThe program establishes minimum requirements for enterprise-wide safety, environmental and Department of Transportation loss-prevention activities, and contributes to our compliance with applicable safety and environmental-related laws, rules and regulations.\nHealth and Well-being\nCreating a culture where all colleagues feel supported and valued is paramount to our corporate mission. Our well-being goals are for colleagues to physically thrive, flourish mentally and emotionally, be socially connected and achieve financial security. Energizer is proud to provide 100% of our colleagues with access to an employee assistance plan (EAP). Energizers EAP offers colleagues and their eligible dependents counseling and well-being resources, 24 hours a day, seven days a week by phone, online or via the mobile site.\nWe provide ongoing communications and tools to continue meeting our colleagues needs, including a well-being program. In addition to the social benefits offered in different countries, we also offer market-competitive core benefit plans in\nmost of the countries where we operate that are designed to support our colleagues overall well-being. Well-being is more important now than ever, and our colleagues value holistic resources to help them balance work and home demands.\nWe utilize our flexible working guidelines to allow colleagues and their managers to establish flexible work arrangements that address when, where and how their work gets done. Enabling a flexible workplace removes barriers that may prohibit success and better addresses our colleagues different work and life needs.\nCommunity\nEnergizer believes in supporting the communities where we live, work and play. Many of our colleagues are highly active with charities of their own choosing, and the Energizer Giving Foundation enables them to make a greater difference by matching their contributions dollar-for-dollar. Energizer also supports Feed the Children and disaster relief efforts through our partnership with Red Cross.\nSince 2016, Energizer has donated more than 15 million batteries and portable lighting products in North America alone. The World Health Organization celebrates World Hearing Day every March to raise awareness of hearing loss, encourage individuals to recognize the signs of hearing loss in themselves or loved ones and advocate for audiology checkups. In support of this effort, Rayovac promotes an online hub of information and articles for consumers to raise awareness of the seriousness and importance of hearing loss, and help people to recognize their own hearing loss, or recognize the symptoms in a loved one - prompting them to get a checkup.\nRelevant Company Policies\nEnergizer Holdings policies in support of the topics discussed in this section, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, Social Policy (Human Rights and Labor Rights), and Safety, Health and Environmental Policy, can be found in the Policies section of the Energizer Holdings, Inc. website.\nGovernmental Regulations and Environmental Matters\nOur operations, including the manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, advertising and sale of our products, are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those intended to protect public health and the environment. In the U.S. many of our products are regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, and by the Federal Trade Commission with respect to advertising. Similar regulations have been adopted by authorities in foreign countries where we sell our products, and by state and local authorities in the U.S. We are also subject to extended producer responsibility (EPR) fees regarding the recycling of batteries and packaging; regulations regarding transportation, storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment; and regulations in other related areas, such as sustainability, including the European Union Batteries Regulation Directive and updates to EU REACH and Classification, Labeling, and Packaging (CLP) laws. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, foreign, state and local governmental authorities.\nIn recent years, refrigerants such as R-134a, which is a critical component of our auto care business aftermarket A/C products, have become the subject of regulatory focus due to their potential to contribute to global warming. The EU has passed regulations that essentially phased out of R-134a in automotive cooling systems in new vehicles by 2017. Canada has also implemented similar regulations, phasing into effect beginning in 2021. The United States passed the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act (AIM Act) in 2020, which also regulates refrigerants, and individual states are also regulating the sale and distribution of products containing R-134a. In addition, regulations may also be enacted governing the packing, use and disposal of our auto care business' products containing refrigerants.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits bribery of public officials to obtain or retain business in foreign jurisdictions and requires us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain internal accounting controls to detect and prevent bribery and to ensure that transactions are properly authorized. We are also subject to similar or even more restrictive anti-corruption laws imposed by the governments of other countries where we do business, including the UK Bribery Act of 2010 and the Brazil Clean Company Act. We make sales and operate in countries known to experience corruption that are rated as high-risk nations. Our business activities in such countries create the risk of unauthorized conduct by one or more of our employees, customs brokers, freight forwarders, or distributors that could be in violation of various laws including the FCPA or similar local regulations.\nOur business is subject to competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including the Sherman Antitrust Act and related federal and state antitrust laws in the U.S. These laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices, boycotting competitors, or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition. In many\njurisdictions, compliance with these competition laws is of special importance to us, and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities, due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.\nThe Company is also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer, customer, vendor or employee data. Such privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including with respect to the European Union's GDPR, the Brazilian Data Protection Law, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), and the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations, are continuously developing and evolving and there is significant uncertainty with respect to how compliance with these laws and regulations may evolve and the costs and complexity of future compliance.\nWe also must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, recycling of batteries and packaging, the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances, chemicals in products and product safety. We are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of our current and former manufacturing facilities. In addition, some of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many years and, over that time, some of those facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may now be considered hazardous. It is possible that those sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom we have sent waste, may be identified and become the subject of remediation. We could also become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future, whether as a result of new laws and regulations or otherwise, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFor additional information on the laws and regulations that apply to our business, see MD&A and Note 22, Environmental and Regulatory, to our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of the risks associated with these laws and regulations, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\"\nAvailable Information\nEnergizer regularly files periodic reports with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, as well as, from time to time, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports. The SEC maintains an Internet site containing these reports, and proxy and information statements, at www.sec.gov. These filings are also available free of charge on Energizer's website, at www.energizerholdings.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after their electronic filing with the SEC. Information on Energizer's website does not constitute part of this Form 10-K. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in our industry and others of which are more specific to our own businesses. The discussion below addresses the material factors, of which we are currently aware, that could affect, and in certain cases have affected, our businesses, results of operations and financial condition and make an investment in the Company speculative or risky.\nSome of these risks include:\nGlobal economic and financial market conditions, including the conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and actions taken by our customers, suppliers, other business partners and governments in markets in which we compete might materially and negatively impact us.\nCompetition in our product categories might hinder our ability to execute our business strategy, achieve profitability, or maintain relationships with existing customers.\nChanges in the retail environment and consumer preferences could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must successfully manage the demand, supply, and operational challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and any other disease outbreak, including epidemics, pandemics, or similar widespread public health concerns.\nLoss or impairment of the reputation of our Company or our leading brands or failure of our marketing plans could have an adverse effect on our business.\nLoss of any of our principal customers could significantly decrease our sales and profitability.\nOur ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation and changing consumer habits.\nWe are subject to risks related to our international operations, including currency fluctuations, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and market similar products, which could adversely affect our market share and results of operations.\nChanges in production costs, including raw material prices and transportation costs, from inflation or otherwise, have adversely affected, and in the future could erode, our profit margins and negatively impact operating results.\nOur reliance on certain significant suppliers subjects us to numerous risks, including possible interruptions in supply, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is vulnerable to the availability of raw materials, our ability to forecast customer demand and our ability to manage production capacity.\nThe manufacturing facilities, supply channels or other business operations of the Company and our suppliers may be subject to disruption from events beyond our control.\nThe Company's future results may be affected by its operational execution, including scenarios where the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated.\nIf our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets become impaired, we will be required to record impairment charges, which may be significant.\nA failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our ability to conduct business.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any inadequacy, interruption, theft or loss of data, malicious attack, integration failure, failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on our systems or other security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and damage the reputation of our brands.\nWe have significant debt obligations that could adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations.\nIf we pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures, we might experience operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences that may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results, and we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses.\nOur business involves the potential for product liability claims, labeling claims, commercial claims and other legal claims against us, which could affect our results of operations and financial condition and result in product recalls or withdrawals.\nOur business is subject to increasing government regulations in both the U.S. and abroad that could impose material costs.\nIncreased focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, customers, consumers and shareholders on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, including those related to sustainability and climate change, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditional factors that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition are discussed in Forward-Looking Statements in MD&A. However, other factors not discussed below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could also adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face.\nAny risk factor described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any of our other SEC filings could by itself, or together with other factors, materially adversely affect our liquidity, competitive position, business, reputation, results of operations, capital position or financial condition, including by materially increasing our expenses or decreasing our revenues, which could result in material losses. Investors should not interpret the disclosure of a risk to imply that the risk has not already materialized.\nEconomic, Competitive and Industry Risks\nGlobal economic and financial market conditions, including the conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and actions taken by our customers, suppliers, other business partners and governments in markets in which we compete might materially and negatively impact us.\nGeneral economic factors beyond our control could adversely affect our business and results of operations. These factors include, but are not limited to, recent supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, wage pressures, rising inflation and potential economic slowdown or recession, as well as input costs including fuel and energy costs (for example, the price of gasoline), foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and other matters that influence consumer spending and preferences.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused considerable volatility to global economic conditions and the economies in regions in which we conduct business. While we experienced reduced demand for certain of our consumer products as a result of the pandemic, demand increased for other products. In the future, our business might be adversely affected in a material way by lower consumer demand due to recessionary economic conditions, including after the direct impact of the COVID-19\npandemic has subsided. In response to unfavorable economic conditions, there has been and, in the future, could be a reduction in discretionary spending, which may lead to reduced net sales or cause a shift in our product mix from higher-margin to lower-margin product offerings or a shift of purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as private label brands sold by retail chains or price brands. This shift could drive the market towards lower margin products or force us to reduce prices for our products in order to compete. Similarly, our retailer customers could reduce their inventories, shift to different products or require us to lower our prices to retain the shelf placement of our products. Conversely, rapid increases in demand due to improving economic conditions could lead to supply chain challenges.\nGlobal markets continued to face threats and uncertainty during fiscal year 2022. Uncertain economic and financial market conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of our customers, suppliers and other business partners. Any significant decrease in customers purchases of our products or our inability to collect accounts receivable resulting from an adverse impact of the global markets on customers financial condition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, disruptions in financial markets could reduce our access to debt and equity capital markets, negatively affecting our ability to implement our business strategy.\nCompetition in our product categories might hinder our ability to execute our business strategy, achieve profitability, or maintain relationships with existing customers.\nWe face intense competition from consumer product companies both in the U.S. and in global markets. Most of our products compete with other widely advertised, promoted and merchandised brands within each product category. The categories in which we operate are mature and highly competitive, with a mix of large, small, and private label manufacturers competing for consumer acceptance, limited retail shelf space and e-commerce opportunities. Because of the highly competitive environment in which we operate, our customers, including online retailers, frequently seek to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms, resulting in either a reduction of our margins or the loss of distribution to lower-cost competitors.\nCompetition in our product categories is based upon brand perceptions, innovation, product performance, customer service and price. Our ability to compete effectively is, and in the future could be, affected by a number of factors, including:\nCertain of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and development, and other resources and greater market share in certain segments than we do, which could provide them with greater scale and negotiating leverage with retailers and suppliers. These competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than we can.\nOur competitors may have lower production, sales and distribution costs, and higher profit margins.\nOur competitors have obtained, and may in the future be able to obtain, exclusivity or sole source at particular retailers or favorable in-store placement.\nWe may lose market share to certain retailers, including club stores, grocery, dollar stores, mass merchandisers and internet-based retailers, which may offer private label brands that are typically sold at lower prices and compete with our products in certain categories.\nChanges in the retail environment and consumer preferences could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur sales have historically been largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery, mass retail outlet, warehouse club and dollar store channels. We cannot, however, predict how the retail environment will evolve. Alternative retail channels, including hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and subscription services, have become more prevalent, and retailers are increasingly selling consumer products through such channels. In addition, alternative sales channels and business models, such as private label and store brands, direct-to-consumer brands and channels and discounter channels continue to evolve. In particular, the growing presence of, and increasing sales through, e-commerce retailers have affected, and may continue to affect, consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online) and market dynamics, including any pricing pressures for consumer goods as retailers face added costs to build their e-commerce capacity. These trends have been magnified due to the COVID-19 pandemic in many of our geographies. Although we are engaged in e-commerce with respect to many of our products, if we are not successful in responding to these competitive factors, changing consumer preferences and market dynamics or expanding sales through evolving sales channels, especially e-commerce retailers, hard discounters and other alternative retail channels, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nWe must successfully manage the demand, supply, and operational challenges brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and any other disease outbreak, including epidemics, pandemics, or similar widespread public health concerns.\nOur operations are impacted by consumer spending levels, impulse purchases, the availability of our products to retailers and our ability to manufacture, store and distribute products to our customers and consumers in an effective and efficient manner. The fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease outbreak or similar widespread public health concern, such as COVID-19, negatively impacted portions of our business in fiscal 2022, and could continue to negatively impact our overall business, financial position and financial results. These impacts may include, but are not limited to:\n\u25aaSignificant reductions, shifts or fluctuations in demand for one or more of our products, which may be caused by, among other things:\n-a decrease in consumer traffic in brick-and-mortar stores across all our major markets\u037e\n-the temporary inability of our consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine, other travel restrictions, or financial hardship\u037e\n-shifts in demand away from one or more of our premium products to lower priced value or private label products and lower demand in our discretionary product categories\u037e\n-stockpiling or similar pantry-loading activity by consumers, which may cause volatility in our quarterly results and, if prolonged, further increase the complexity of our operations planning and financial forecasting and adversely impact our results of operations\u037e\n-significant reductions in the availability of one or more of our products as a result of retailers, common carriers or other shippers modifying restocking, fulfillment and shipping practices\u037e or\n-shifts, fluctuations, or cancellation of orders due to the impact on customers operations, including the possibility of temporary or permanent closure.\n\u25aaInability to meet our customers needs due to disruptions in our manufacturing and supply chain arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply chain elements, such as raw materials or other finished product components, transportation, workforce, or other manufacturing and distribution capability. In addition, we may incur higher costs for transportation, workforce and distribution capability in order to maintain the surety of supplying product to our customers;\n\u25aaFailure of third parties upon which we rely, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors and commercial banks, to meet their obligations to us in a timely manner, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may adversely impact our operations, liquidity and financial results\u037e and\n\u25aaSignificant changes in the political and regulatory landscape in the markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, which may include, but are not limited to, restrictions on international trade, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or suspend our or our third-party partners' or customers' operating and/or manufacturing capabilities, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of our products, which could adversely impact our results.\nWe also cannot predict the impact that the ongoing pandemic will have on our customers, suppliers, vendors and other business partners, and their respective financial conditions. Even after the pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the viruss global economic impact, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on our liquidity and the impacts of any future economic downturn.\nLoss or impairment of the reputation of our Company or our leading brands or failure of our marketing plans could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on the continuing reputation and success of our brands. Maintaining a strong reputation with consumers, customers, the trade, suppliers and other third-party partners is critical to the success of our business. Negative publicity about us or our brands, including product safety, quality, efficacy, environmental impacts (including packaging, energy and water use, matters related to climate and waste management) and other sustainability or similar issues, whether real or perceived, could occur and could be widely and rapidly disseminated, including through the use of social media or network sites. Our operating results could be adversely affected if any of our brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived issues. Any damage to our brands could impair our ability to charge premium prices for our products, resulting in the reduction of our margins or losses of distribution to lower price competitors, or may require us to record impairments of intangible assets, including trademarks or goodwill, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or new product offerings do not improve, or have a negative impact on, our brands image or ability to attract and retain consumers. Additionally, if claims made in our marketing campaigns subject us to claims and litigation alleging false advertising, which is common in some categories in our industry, such claims and litigation could damage our brand or cause us to alter our marketing plans in ways that may materially and adversely affect sales, or result in the imposition of significant damages against us. In addition, our products could face quality or safety issues, which could result in our withdrawing or recalling the product from the marketplace and may lead to decreased\ndemand for, and sales of, such products and harm the reputation of the related brands. We also license certain of our brands to third parties, and such licenses and partnerships may create additional exposure for those brands to product safety, quality, sustainability and other concerns.\nLoss of any of our principal customers could significantly decrease our sales and profitability.\nA large percentage of our sales are attributable to a relatively small number of retail customers, and we may continue to derive a significant portion of our future revenues from a small number of customers. Additionally, with the growing trend towards retailer consolidation, both in the U.S. and internationally, the rapid growth of e-commerce and the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers, we are increasingly dependent on certain retailers. As a result, changes in the strategies or demands of our largest customers, including a reduction in the number of brands they carry, a shift of shelf space to private label or competitors products or a decision to lower pricing of consumer products, including branded products, may harm our net sales or margins, and reduce our ability to offer new, innovative products to consumers. Furthermore, these large, consolidated companies could also exert additional competitive pressure on our other customers, which could in turn lead to similar demands on us. If we cease doing business with a significant customer or if we experience a significant reduction in net sales to a key customer, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCustomers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from us at any time and for any reason. If we do not effectively respond to the demands of our customers, they could decrease their purchases from us, causing our net sales and net earnings to decline.\nOur ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation and changing consumer habits.\nA large percentage of our revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition. Achieving our business results depends, in part, on successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. The successful development and introduction of new products requires retail and consumer acceptance and overcoming the reaction from competitors. New product introductions in categories where we have existing products will likely also reduce the sales of our existing products. Our investments in research and development may not result in successful products or innovation that will recover the costs of such investments. Our customers or consumers may not purchase our new products once introduced. Additionally, new products could require regulatory approval which may not be available or may require modification to the product which could impact the production process and the timely introduction of the products. Our competitors may introduce new or enhanced products that outperform ours, or develop manufacturing technology that permits them to manufacture at a lower cost relative to ours and sell at a lower price. If we fail to develop and launch successful new products or fail to reduce our cost structure to a competitive level, we may be unable to grow our business and compete successfully.\nWe must also successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors. Failure to continually innovate, improve and respond to competitive moves and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our results. With respect to the battery category, we have been assessing volume and device trends over the last several years, and although baseline emerging device and demographic trends combined with the stabilization of the device universe lead us to believe the long term outlook for category volume will be flat to slightly positive, there is no assurance this trend will continue. An increasing number of devices are using built-in battery systems, such as rechargeable hearing aids, particularly in developed markets, leading to potential declining volume trend in the battery category. Additionally, there could be a negative impact on the demand for primary batteries and could put additional pressure on results going forward, both directly through reduced consumption and indirectly as manufacturers aggressively price and promote their products to seek to retain market share or gain battery shelf space.\nOur business also depends on our ability to continue to manufacture our existing products to meet the applicable product performance claims. Any decline in these standards could result in the loss of business and negatively impact our performance and financial results. Finally, our ability to maintain favorable margins on our products requires us to manage our manufacturing and other production costs relative to our prices. We may not be able to increase our prices in response to production cost increases, which would decrease our profit margins and negatively impact our business and financial results.\nWe have implemented price increases in the past, including those announced during fiscal 2022, and may implement price increases in the future, which may slow sales growth or create volume declines in the short term as customers and consumers adjust to these price increases. In addition, our competitors may or may not take competitive actions, which may lead to sales declines and loss of market share. If we are unable to increase market share in existing product lines, develop product innovations, undertake sales, marketing and advertising initiatives that grow our product categories or develop, acquire\nor successfully launch new products or brands, we may not achieve our sales growth objectives. Furthermore, a general decline in the markets for certain product categories has had and may in the future have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operation. In addition, changes to the mix of products that we sell, as well as the mix of countries in which we sell our products, may adversely impact our net sales, profitability and cash flow.\nWe are subject to risks related to our international operations, including currency fluctuations, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe currently conduct our business on a worldwide basis, with more than 40% of our sales in fiscal year 2022 arising from foreign countries, and a significant portion of our production capacity and cash is located overseas. Consequently, we are subject to a number of risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, including:\nchanging macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of inflation, volatile commodity prices and increases in the cost of raw materials, labor, energy, and logistics, which could impact the manufacturing operations of the Company and our third-party manufacturers;\npolitical or economic instability, labor disputes, government corruption and civil unrest, including political or economic instability in the countries of the Eurozone, Egypt, Russia, the Middle East and certain markets in Latin America;\npotential disruption from wars and military conflicts, including the conflict in Ukraine;\nprice controls and related government actions;\nthe possibility of nationalization of business or industries, expropriation, confiscatory taxation or other similar government action;\nthe inability to repatriate foreign-based cash for strategic needs in the U.S., either at all or without incurring significant income tax and earnings consequences, as well as the heightened counterparty, internal control and country-specific risks associated with holding cash overseas;\nthe effect of foreign income taxes, value-added taxes and withholding taxes, including the inability to recover amounts owed to us by a government authority without extended proceedings or at all;\nthe effect of the U.S. tax treatment of foreign source income and losses, and other restrictions on the flow of capital between countries;\nadverse changes in local investment, local employment, local training or exchange control regulations;\nlegal and regulatory constraints, including the imposition of tariffs, trade restrictions, price, profit or other government controls, labor laws, immigration restrictions, travel restrictions, including as a result of COVID-19 or other outbreaks of infectious diseases, import and export laws or other government actions generating a negative impact on our business, including changes in trade policies that may be implemented;\ncurrency fluctuations, including the impact of hyper-inflationary conditions in certain economies, particularly where exchange controls limit or eliminate our ability to convert from local currency;\ndifficulties in hiring and retaining qualified employees;\nemployment litigation related to employees, contractors and suppliers, particularly in Latin America and Europe;\ndifficulties in obtaining or unavailability of raw materials;\ndifficulty in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;\ncontinuing legal, political and economic uncertainty and disruption from the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, including the long-term impact of the bilateral trade and cooperation deal governing the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union;\nlack of well-established or reliable, and impartial legal systems in certain countries where we operate;\nchallenges relating to enforcement of or compliance with local laws and regulations and with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the U.S., including without limitation, the U.S. FCPA; and\nrisks related to natural disasters, terrorism, social unrest and other events beyond our control.\nFor example, Russias invasion of Ukraine could lead to disruption, instability and volatility in global markets and industries that could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. The United States and certain other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia and could impose further sanctions that could disrupt international commerce and the global economy. Given these recent sanctions and export restrictions imposed by the United States and foreign government bodies, in March 2022 we exited the Russian market. The impact of these government measures and our exit of our operations in Russia, as well as any further retaliatory actions taken by Russia, the United States, and other foreign governments, is currently unknown and they could adversely affect our business, results of operations, supply chain, intellectual property, customers or employees and may expose us to adverse legal proceedings in Russia in the future. Potential impacts related to the conflict could include, without limitation, additional unilateral or multilateral export control and sanctions measures, supply chain and logistics disruptions, adverse global economic conditions resulting from escalating geopolitical tensions and the exclusion of Russian financial institutions from the global banking system, volatility and fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates and interest rates, volatility and inflationary pressures on raw materials, and heightened cybersecurity threats, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks with respect to our net sales, net earnings and cash flow driven by movements of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. A weakening of the currencies in which sales are denominated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease net earnings and cash flow, and our foreign currency hedges only offset a portion of our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, including devaluations. Foreign currency fluctuations also may affect our ability to achieve sales growth. A weakening of foreign currencies in which we generate sales relative to the U.S. dollar would decrease our net sales. Accordingly, our reported net earnings may be negatively affected by changes in foreign exchange rates.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and market similar products, which could adversely affect our market share and results of operations.\nThe vast majority of our total revenues are from products bearing proprietary trademarks. In addition, we own or license a number of patents, patent applications and other technology. We rely on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that we will be able to effectively utilize these intellectual property rights or that we can successfully assert or defend these rights. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect or maintain our own intellectual property rights or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. In addition, even if we can protect such rights in the United States, the laws of some other countries in which we sell our products may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. It is also possible that our brands may not be available for use in certain countries due to prior third-party rights, thereby limiting expansion of our brands. If other parties infringe our intellectual property rights, they may dilute or diminish the value of our brands and products in the marketplace, which could diminish the value that consumers associate with our brands and harm our net sales. The failure to perfect and protect our intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot be certain that our intellectual property rights will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future, and we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions relating to such rights. As patents expire, we could face increased competition, which could negatively impact our operating results. Additionally, a finding that we have violated the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, through the use of third-party marks, ideas or technologies, could result in the need to cease use of such trademark, trade secret, copyrighted work or patented invention in our business, as well as the obligation to pay for past infringement. If holders are willing to permit us to continue to use such intellectual property rights, they could require a payment of a substantial amount for continued use of those rights. Either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause us to become less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational and Technology Risks\nChanges in production costs, including raw material prices and transportation costs, from inflation or otherwise, have adversely affected, and in the future could erode, our profit margins and negatively impact operating results.\nPricing and availability of raw materials, energy, transportation and other services needed for our business can be volatile due to general economic conditions, inflation, labor costs, production levels, import duties and tariffs and other factors beyond our control. There is no certainty that we will be able to offset future cost increases. This volatility can significantly affect our production cost and may, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nVolatility, availability and increases in the cost of raw materials and transportation have negatively impacted, and are likely to continue to negatively impact, the Company's results of operations. Significant inflationary pressures have impacted our gross margin in fiscal 2022, and we expect inflationary pressures to continue into fiscal 2023. We believe commodity price and other cost increases and volatility, especially due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could continue in the future. If such increases occur or exceed our estimates and we are not able to increase the prices of our products or achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases, our results of operation would be harmed. In addition, even if we increase the prices of our products in response to increases in the cost of commodities, transportation or other cost increases, we may not be able to sustain our price increases. Sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices, which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share. Our projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reliance on certain significant suppliers subjects us to numerous risks, including possible interruptions in supply, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to maintain consistent quality throughout our operations depends in part upon our ability to acquire certain products in sufficient quantities. Supply shortages for a particular component can delay production and thus delay shipments to customers and the associated revenue of all products using that component. This has caused, and, in the future, could cause us to experience a reduction in sales, increased inventory levels and costs and could adversely affect relationships with existing and prospective customers. In some cases, we may have only one supplier for a product or service. Our dependence on single-source suppliers subjects us to the possible risks of shortages, interruptions and price fluctuations, and possible litigation when we change vendors because of performance issues. Global economic factors continue to put significant pressure on suppliers, all of which tends to make the supply environment more expensive. If any of these vendors is unable to fulfill its obligations, or if we are unable to find replacement suppliers in the event of a supply disruption, we could encounter supply shortages and/or incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies, either of which could materially harm our business.\nOur business is vulnerable to the availability of raw materials, as well as our ability to forecast customer demand and manage production capacity.\nOur ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our production capacity and on obtaining timely and adequate delivery of materials, parts and components from our suppliers. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit the amounts supplied to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Supply disruptions may also occur due to shortages of critical materials. In addition, a number of our raw materials are obtained from a single supplier. Many of our suppliers must undertake a time-consuming qualification process before we can incorporate their raw materials into our production process. If we are unable to obtain materials from a qualified supplier, it can take up to a year to qualify a new supplier, assuming an alternative source of supply is available. Our raw materials and component parts are also susceptible to currency fluctuations and price fluctuations due to supply and demand, transportation, government regulations, price controls, tariffs, economic climate, or other unforeseen circumstances. We have experienced some shortages and allocations of component parts due to COVID-19, mainly related to our auto care operations. We continue to qualify additional sources to ensure continued supply of these items. A reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of one or more supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A reduction or disruption in our production capacity or our supplies could delay products and the fulfillment of orders and otherwise negatively impact our business and reputation.\nWe must accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials. If we overestimate demand, we may experience underutilized capacity and excess inventory levels. If we underestimate demand, we may miss delivery deadlines and sales opportunities and incur additional costs for labor overtime, equipment overuse and logistical complexities. In addition, sales of certain of our products tend to be seasonal. As a result of this seasonality, our inventory and working capital needs fluctuate significantly throughout the year. Orders from retailers are often made late in the period preceding the applicable peak season, making forecasting of production schedules and inventory purchases difficult. Difficulties in the production process could reduce yields or interrupt production, and, as a result, we may not be able to deliver products on time or in a cost-effective, competitive manner. Our failure to adequately manage our capacity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, as a result of the desire of retailers to more closely manage inventory levels, there is a growing trend among them to purchase products on a just-in-time basis. Due to a number of factors, including manufacturing lead-times, availability of raw materials, seasonal purchasing patterns and the potential for material price increases, we may be required to shorten our lead-time for production and more closely anticipate our retailers and customers demands, which has caused us to, and in the future could require us to, carry additional inventories and increase our working capital and related financing requirements. This may increase the cost of warehousing inventory or result in excess inventory becoming difficult to manage, unusable or obsolete. In addition, if our retailers significantly change their inventory management strategies, we may encounter difficulties in filling customer orders or in liquidating excess inventories, or may find that customers are cancelling orders or returning products, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe manufacturing facilities, supply channels or other business operations of the Company and our suppliers may be subject to disruption from events beyond our control.\nOperations of the manufacturing and packaging facilities worldwide and corporate offices of the Company and our suppliers, and the methods we and our suppliers use to obtain supplies and to distribute our products, may be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, cyber-attacks and other disruptions in information technology\nsystems, demonstrations, disease outbreaks or pandemics, acts of war or conflicts (including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine), terrorism, fire, earthquakes, flooding or other natural disasters, disruptions in logistics, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, supplier capacity constraints, raw material and product quality or safety issues, industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues, availability of raw materials, and other regulatory issues, trade disputes between countries in which we have operations, such as the U.S. and China. There is also a possibility that third-party manufacturers, which produce a significant portion of certain of our products, could discontinue production with little or no advance notice, or experience financial problems or problems with product quality or timeliness of product delivery, resulting in manufacturing delays or disruptions, regulatory sanctions, product liability claims or consumer complaints. If a major disruption were to occur, it could result in delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations. We maintain business interruption insurance to potentially mitigate the impact of business interruption, but such coverage may not be sufficient to offset the financial or reputational impact of an interruption.\nThe Company's future results may be affected by its operational execution, including its ability to achieve cost savings as a result of any current or future restructuring efforts.\nThe Company's financial results depend on the successful execution of its business operating plans. To operate more efficiently and control costs, we have entered into, and may in the future enter into, restructuring and cost reduction plans. Our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions and other factors that we may not be able to control. We may also incur significant charges related to restructuring plans, which would reduce our profitability in the periods such charges are incurred. Execution of any restructuring program also presents a number of significant risks, including:\nactual or perceived disruption of service or reduction in service standards to customers;\nthe failure to preserve adequate internal controls as we restructure our general and administrative functions, including our information technology and financial reporting infrastructure;\nthe failure to preserve supplier relationships and distribution, sales and other important relationships and to resolve conflicts that may arise;\nloss of sales as we reduce or eliminate staffing for non-core product lines;\ndiversion of management attention from ongoing business activities; and\nfailure to maintain employee morale and retain key employees while implementing benefit changes and reductions in the workforce.\nGaining additional efficiencies may become increasingly difficult over time. If we are unable to generate anticipated cost savings, successfully implement our strategies or efficiently manage our supply chain and manufacturing processes, our results of operations could suffer.\nIn addition, the Company is executing its digital transformation program that is focused on redefining our processes, implementing new tools and expanding our data to enhance connectivity along the value chain and enable us to make decisions faster. We also continue to seek to penetrate new markets and introduce new products and product innovations. We may fail to implement these goals and strategies or to achieve the desired results, and we may fail to achieve one or more of our financial goals for one or more of the relevant fiscal years.\nIf our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets become impaired, we will be required to record impairment charges, which may be significant.\nWe have a material amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which are periodically evaluated for impairment in accordance with current accounting standards. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Fair value for both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on a cash flow analysis. If the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value, the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired. If current expectations for revenue growth rates, gross margin rates, operating expenses, and discount rates are not met, or other economic and financial market conditions were to change, we may be required in the future to record impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets during the period in which any impairment is determined. Any such impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSales of certain of our products are seasonal and adverse weather conditions during our peak selling seasons for certain auto care products could have a material adverse effect.\nSales of certain of our auto care products tend to be seasonal. Historically, sales for certain auto care products typically have peaked during the first six months of the calendar year due to customer seasonal purchasing patterns and the timing of promotional activities. Purchases of our auto care products, especially our auto appearance and A/C recharge products, can be significantly impacted by unfavorable weather conditions during the summer period, and as a result we may suffer decreases in net sales if conditions are not favorable for use of our products. If adverse weather conditions during the first six months of the calendar year (our second and third fiscal quarters) when demand for auto care products typically peaks persist, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nA failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our ability to conduct business.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems, including some that are managed by third-party service providers, in order to conduct business. These systems include, but are not limited to, programs and processes relating to internal and external communications, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, and complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements. These information technology systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to the poor performance or failure of third-party service providers, catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, network outages, failed upgrades or other similar events. If our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in conducting our business, which may adversely impact our operating results. In addition, we continuously assess and implement upgrades to improve our information technology systems globally. As such, during these implementation periods, we face a heightened risk of system interruptions and deficiencies or failures in our internal controls involving our information systems and processes.\nWe continue to utilize various legacy hardware, software and operating systems, which may be vulnerable to increased risks, including the risk of system failures and disruptions, and may need to be upgraded or replaced in the future as third-party service providers stop supporting these systems. If we do not successfully upgrade or replace these legacy systems in a timely manner, system outages, disruptions or delays, or other issues may arise. We must also successfully integrate the technology systems of acquired companies into our existing and future technology systems, including with third-party service providers and processes. If a new system does not function properly or is not adequately supported by third-party service providers and processes, it could limit or prevent us from processing and delivering customer orders and processing and receiving payments for our products. This could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any inadequacy, interruption, theft or loss of data, malicious attack, integration failure, failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on our systems or other security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and damage the reputation of our brands.\nOur systems and networks, as well as those of our retailer customers, suppliers, service providers, and banks, have and may in the future become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches, which in turn could result in the unauthorized release and misuse of confidential or proprietary information about our company, employees, customers or consumers, as well as disrupt their and our operations or damage their and our facilities or those of third parties. We have seen an increase in the number of such attacks since a large number of our employees began working remotely. Furthermore, such attacks may originate from nation states or attempts by outside parties, hackers, criminal organizations or other threat actors. Any significant breaches or breakdowns of such databases or systems could result in significant costs, including costs to investigate or remediate. While we have taken steps to maintain and enhance cyber security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing security technologies, internal controls, network and data center resiliency, redundancy and recovery processes, upgrading our remote work environment and by obtaining insurance coverage, these measures may be inadequate. In addition, such incidents could result in unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material confidential information. Cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated, are constantly evolving and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives, and this increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Data breaches or theft of personal information we and our third-party service providers collect, as well as company information and assets, have occurred in the past and may occur in the future and the failure to remediate such intrusions may adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to attract, retain and develop key personnel, as well as effectively manage human capital resources.\nOur future performance depends significantly upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key personnel, as well as our continuing ability to attract, retain and develop highly qualified and diverse personnel, including future members of our management team. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we can retain and motivate our key employees or attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future.\nIn addition, competition for labor remains strong and labor costs for manufacturing in the US and Singapore, among other countries, are rising. Labor is one of the primary components in the cost of operating our business. If we face labor shortages and increased labor costs as a result of increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover rates, increases in employee benefits costs, or labor union organizing efforts, our operating expenses could increase and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Labor shortages, higher employee turnover rates and labor union organizing efforts could also lead to disruptions in our business.\nA failure to adequately manage human capital resources could have a material adverse effective on our business, prospects, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the escalating costs of offering and administering health care, retirement and other benefits for employees could result in reduced profitability.\nFinancial and Strategic Risks\nWe have significant debt obligations that could adversely affect our business.\nAs of September 30, 2022, our total aggregate outstanding indebtedness was approximately $3.6 billion. We had $492.0 million of additional capacity available under a senior secured revolving credit facility, inclusive of issued and outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $8.0 million. This significant amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our shareholders, including:\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on this debt, thereby limiting the cash we have available to fund future growth opportunities, such as research and development, capital expenditures and acquisitions;\nrestrictive covenants in our debt arrangements that limit our operations and borrowing, and place restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase common stock;\nthe risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt or rising interest rates on our variable rate debt increasing future debt costs and limiting the future availability of debt financing;\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry, due to the need to use our cash to service our outstanding debt;\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged with debt and that may therefore be able to invest more in their business or use their available cash to pursue other opportunities, including acquisitions; and\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.\nIn addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of our outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance our debt.\nWe may need to seek additional financing for our general corporate purposes. For example, we may need to increase our investment in research and development activities or require funding to make acquisitions. Although the indentures and credit agreements relating to our existing debt contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and, under certain circumstances, the amount of debt that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. We may be unable to obtain desired additional financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. For example, during periods of volatile credit markets, there is a risk that lenders, even those with strong balance sheets and sound lending practices, could fail or refuse to honor their credit commitments and obligations, including, but not limited to, extending credit up to the maximum permitted by a credit facility and otherwise accessing capital or honoring loan commitments. If our lenders are unable to fund borrowings under their loan commitments or we are unable to borrow, it could be difficult to replace such loan commitments on similar terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund growth opportunities, successfully develop or enhance products, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect our business. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our shareholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on our operations and ability to pay dividends due to restrictive covenants. Generally, to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, all of the risks described above in connection with our debt obligations could increase.\nIn addition, the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate for borrowings under our revolving credit facility and certain derivative instruments, is expected to be phased out in calendar year 2023. A reference rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or another alternative benchmark rate, is expected to be\nestablished to replace LIBOR. Once the relevant administrator announces that LIBOR has ceased or will cease to be available, or the required lenders elect to opt-in early to a new reference rate, the Company and the lenders under the revolving credit facility will be required to mutually select a substitute reference rate, and if such substitute reference rate, or the replacement reference rate for our derivative instruments, is higher than LIBOR, our interest expense related to such borrowings may increase.\nOur credit ratings are important to our cost of capital.\nWe expect that the major credit rating agencies will continue to evaluate our creditworthiness and give us specified credit ratings. These credit ratings are limited in scope, and do not address all material risks related to investment in Energizer, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued. Nonetheless, the credit ratings we receive will impact our borrowing costs as well as our access to sources of capital on terms that will be advantageous to our business. Failure to obtain sufficiently high credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate in future financings, our liquidity or our competitive position and could also restrict our access to capital markets. There can be no assurance that any credit ratings we receive will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agencies if, in such rating agencys judgments, circumstances so warrant.\nWe may experience losses or be subject to increased funding and expenses related to our pension plans.\nWe assumed pension plan liabilities related to our current and former employees in connection with the separation. Effective January 1, 2014, the pension benefit earned to date by active participants under the legacy U.S. pension plan was frozen and future retirement service benefits are no longer accrued under this retirement program; however, our pension plan obligations remain significant. If the investment of plan assets does not provide the expected long-term returns, if interest rates or other assumptions change, or if governmental regulations change the timing or amounts of required contributions to the plans, we could be required to make significant additional pension contributions, which may have an adverse impact on our liquidity, our ability to comply with debt covenants and may require recognition of increased expense within our financial statements.\nThe estimates and assumptions on which our financial projections are based may prove to be inaccurate, which may cause our actual results to materially differ from our projections, which may adversely affect our future profitability, cash flows and stock price.\nOur financial projections, including any sales or earnings guidance or outlook we may provide from time to time, depend on certain estimates and assumptions related to, among other things, a number of factors: product category growth; development and launch of innovative new products; market share projections; product pricing and sale, volume and product mix; foreign exchange rates and volatility; tax rates; manufacturing costs including commodity prices; distribution channel volume and costs; cost savings; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves, measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans; and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business, fund internal growth, repurchase our stock, make acquisitions, pay dividends and meet debt obligations.\nWe develop our financial projections based on historical experience and on various other estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made. Our actual results may differ materially from our financial projections. Any material variation between our financial projections and our actual results may adversely affect our future profitability, cash flows and stock price.\nIf we pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures, we might experience operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences that may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results, and we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures that could further our strategic objectives. With respect to acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates, consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us, or achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of integration challenges. Some of the areas where we face risks include:\nDiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic transactions;\nFailure to successfully integrate and further develop the acquired business or technology;\nImplementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company;\nIntegration of the acquired companys accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of research and development, commercial and marketing functions;\nTransition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;\nFailure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction;\nIn the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\nCultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire;\nLiability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, data privacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and\nLitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated colleagues, customers, former shareholders, or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic transactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.\nAcquired companies or operations, joint ventures or investments may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability and cash flow expectations. Future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, to the extent that the economic benefits associated with an acquisition or investment diminish in the future or the performance of an acquired company or business is less robust than expected, we may be required to record impairments of intangible assets, including trademarks and goodwill. Any impairment charges could adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. See Note 12, Goodwill and intangible assets for further information related to goodwill and intangible assets, and the impairment charges recorded in the year ended September 30, 2022.\nWe have divested and may, in the future, divest certain assets, businesses or brands that do not meet our strategic objectives or growth targets. With respect to any potential future divestiture, we may encounter difficulty finding potential acquirers or other divestiture options on favorable terms. Any future divestiture could affect our profitability as a result of the gains or losses on such sale of a business or brand, the loss of the operating income or sales resulting from such sale or the costs or liabilities that we retain, which may negatively impact profitability and cash flow subsequent to any divestiture. We may also be required to recognize impairment charges or other losses as a result of a divestiture.\nLegal, Compliance and Sustainability Risks\nOur business involves the potential for product liability claims, labeling claims, commercial claims and other legal claims against us, which could affect our results of operations and financial condition and result in product recalls or withdrawals.\nWe face exposure to claims arising out of alleged defects in our products, including for property damage, bodily injury or other adverse effects; alleged contaminants in our products; and allegations that our products provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use; and failure to perform as advertised. Product liability, advertising and labeling claims could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation, sales and results of operation. If any of our products are found to be defective, we may recall or withdraw such products, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. We maintain product liability insurance, but this insurance does not cover all types of claims, particularly claims that do not involve personal injury or property damage or claims that exceed the amount of insurance coverage. Further, we may not be able to maintain such insurance in sufficient amounts, on desirable terms, or at all, in the future. In addition to the risk of monetary judgments not covered by insurance, product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm our products reputation and in certain cases require a product recall or withdrawal. Product recalls or withdrawals or product liability claims, and any subsequent remedial actions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, brand value, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we are, and may in the future become, the subject of, or party to, various pending or threatened legal actions, government investigations and proceedings relating to, among other things, advertising disputes with competitors, consumer class actions, including those related to advertising claims, labor claims, breach of contract claims, antitrust litigation, securities litigation, premises liability claims, data privacy and security disputes, employment litigation related to employees,\ncontractors and suppliers, including class action lawsuits, and litigation in foreign jurisdictions. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to additional claims, proceedings and actions as we expand the products within the global auto care product category. In general, claims made by or against us in litigation, investigations, disputes or other proceedings have been and may in the future be expensive and time-consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements, injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and harm our reputation. It is not possible to predict the final resolution of litigation, investigations, disputes or proceedings in which we currently are or may in the future become involved and our assessment of the materiality of these matters and any reserves taken in connection therewith may not be consistent with their final resolutions. The impact of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection with such matters, on our business, financial condition and results of operations could be material. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in for additional information related to these matters.\nOur business is subject to increasing government regulations in both the U.S. and abroad that could impose material costs.\nIn general, the manufacture, marketing, distribution, and sale of Energizer's products and the conduct of its business operations must comply with extensive federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. In the US, many of the Company's products and product claims are regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Trade Commission, among other regulatory agencies. Additionally, the Company's and its suppliers' manufacturing and distribution operations are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Energizer's international operations are also subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures, markets or distributes its products. There is also an increased risk of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and related difficulties in maintaining effective internal controls. Additionally, the Company could be subject to future inquiries or investigations by governmental and other regulatory bodies. Any determination that the Company's operations or activities are not in compliance with applicable law could expose the Company to future impairment charges or significant fines, penalties or other sanctions that may result in a reduction in net income or otherwise adversely impact the business and reputation of the Company.\nIn particular, because of the Companys extensive international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations, or allegations of violations, of the FCPA and similar international anti-bribery and corruption laws. These laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls policies and procedures that mandate compliance with these laws will protect us from reckless, intentional or unintentional criminal acts. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal, state and foreign governments may introduce new or expand existing legislation and regulations, or courts or governmental authorities could impose more stringent interpretations of existing legislation and regulations, that may adversely affect our operations or require us to increase our resources, capabilities and expertise in certain areas, as well as incur increased compliance costs. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, foreign, state and local governmental authorities.\nIn recent years, refrigerants such as R-134a have become the subject of regulatory focus due to their potential to contribute to global warming. The EU has passed regulations that essentially phased out of R-134a in automotive cooling systems in new vehicles by 2017. Canada has also implemented similar regulations, phasing into effect beginning in 2021. In the United States, the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act (AIM Act) and its resultant regulations could have a materially adverse impact on our business. In addition, individual states are regulating the sale and distribution of products containing R-134a. Regulations may also be enacted governing the packaging, use and disposal of our auto care business' products containing refrigerants. If the future use of R-134a is phased out or is limited or prohibited in jurisdictions in which we do business, or if substitutes for R-134a become widely used in A/C systems and their use for DIY and retrofit purposes is not approved by the EPA or other regulatory bodies, the future market for our auto care business' products containing R-134a may be limited, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur systems and those of our business partners are subject to regulation to preserve the privacy of certain data held on those systems. Privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including with respect to the EUs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Brazilian Data Protection Law, and the California CCPA, and the interpretation and enforcement of those and similar laws and regulations, are continuously developing and evolving and there may be uncertainty with respect to how to comply with them. The changes introduced by existing privacy and data protection laws and regulations and the introduction of similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions, have subjected, and may continue in the future to subject, us\nto additional costs and have required, and may in the future require, costly changes to our security systems, policies, procedures and practices. We may also be required to incur additional costs to modify or enhance their or our systems or in order to prevent or remediate any such issues. Our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws and regulations may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Company is found to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas, it could be subject to governmental or regulatory actions, including fines, import detentions, injunctions, product withdrawals or recalls or asset seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions and damage to our reputation and brand image, or require the payment of monetary penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, is not merited or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions could jeopardize our reputation and brand image and have a material adverse effect on our businesses, as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation. Additionally, loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations, particularly with respect to our global auto care business, could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand, introducing new products, building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, customers, consumers and shareholders on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, including those related to sustainability and climate change, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation.\nEnergizer is committed to its sustainability journey and has taken meaningful steps including conducting an extensive materiality assessment and publishing ESG goals. Any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or a perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning climate change or other sustainability concerns could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nAs climate change, land use, water use, deforestation, plastic waste, recyclability or recoverability of packaging, including single-use and other plastic packaging, and other sustainability concerns become more prevalent, governmental and non-governmental organizations, customers, consumers and investors are increasingly focusing on these issues. In particular, changing consumer preferences may result in increased customer and consumer concerns and demands regarding plastics and packaging materials, including single-use and non-recyclable plastic packaging, and their environmental impact on sustainability, a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients, or increased consumer concerns or perceptions (whether accurate or inaccurate) regarding the effects of ingredients or substances present in certain consumer products. This increased focus may result in new or increased regulations and customer, consumer and investor demands that could cause us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our operations to comply with any such regulations and address demands. If we are unable to respond or perceived to be inadequately responding to sustainability concerns, customers and consumers may choose to purchase products from another company or a competitor, and certain investors may divert from, or avoid investing in, our securities.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, recycling of batteries and packaging, the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances, chemicals in products and product safety. A release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act or the presence of contamination that predates our ownership or operation of our facilities could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties. Pursuant to certain environmental laws, we could be subject to joint and several strict liability for contamination relating to our or their predecessors current or former properties or any of their respective third-party waste disposal sites. In addition to potentially significant investigation and remediation costs, any such contamination can give rise to claims from governmental authorities or other third parties for natural resource damage, personal injury, property damage or other liabilities. Contamination has been identified at certain of our current and former facilities as well as third-party waste disposal sites, and we are conducting investigation and remediation activities in relation to such properties. The discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of further cleanup obligations at these or other properties or the assertion of tort claims related to such contamination could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenses and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations, including with respect to current and formerly owned facilities, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom we have sent waste. As new laws and regulations are introduced, we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe resolution of our tax contingencies may result in additional tax liabilities, which could adversely impact our cash flows and results of operations.\nSignificant estimation and judgment are required in determining our tax provisions for taxes in the U.S. and jurisdictions outside the U.S. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly audited by tax authorities and, although we believe our tax positions are defensible and our tax provision estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. When particular tax matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the effective tax rate, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.\nRisks Specific to Our Common Stock\nWe cannot guarantee the timing, amount or payment of dividends on our common stock.\nThe timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to shareholders will fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors. The Boards decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, covenants associated with certain of our debt service obligations, legal requirements and regulatory constraints. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay dividends in the future.\nRisk Related to Anti-Takeover Measures\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws, and of Missouri law, may deter or delay an acquisition of Energizer.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain, and the General and Business Corporation Law of Missouri, which we refer to as Missouri law, contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover by making the replacement of incumbent directors more time-consuming and difficult. These provisions include, among others:\nlimitations on the ability of our shareholders to call a special meeting;\nrules regarding how we may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;\nthe right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval;\na provision that our shareholders may only remove directors for cause and with the approval of the holders of two-thirds of our outstanding voting stock at a special meeting of shareholders called expressly for that purpose; and\nthe ability of our directors, and not shareholders, to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors.\nIn addition, because we have not chosen to opt out of coverage of Section 351.459 of Missouri law, which we refer to as the business combination statute, these provisions could also deter or delay a change of control. The business combination statute restricts certain business combination transactions between us and an interested shareholder, generally any person who, together with his or her affiliates and associates, owns or controls 20% or more of the outstanding shares of our voting stock, for a period of five years after the date of the transaction in which the person becomes an interested shareholder, unless either such transaction or the interested shareholders acquisition of stock is approved by our Board on or before the date the interested shareholder obtains such status. The business combination statute also provides that, after the expiration of such five-year period, business combinations are prohibited unless (i) the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting stock, other than the stock owned by the interested shareholder, or any affiliate or associate of such interested shareholder, approve the business combination or (ii) the business combination satisfies certain detailed fairness and procedural requirements.\nWe believe that these provisions will help to protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could deter or delay an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in our best interests or the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\n1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.  Item 2. Properties\nOur principal executive office is in St. Louis, Missouri. Below is a list of Energizer's principal plants and facilities as of the date of filing. Management believes that the Company's production facilities are adequate to support the business and the properties and equipment have been well maintained.\nAmericas\nAsheboro, NC (an owned manufacturing plant and an owned packaging facility)\nGarrettsville, OH (an owned manufacturing plant)\nMarietta, OH (an owned manufacturing plant)\nWestlake, OH (an owned research facility)\nDayton, OH (a leased manufacturing and distribution facility)\nFennimore, WI (an owned manufacturing facility)\nPortage, WI (an owned manufacturing facility)\nFranklin, IN (a leased distribution and packaging facility)\nInternational\nBekasi, Indonesia (an owned manufacturing facility)\nCimanggis, Indonesia (an owned manufacturing facility on leased land)\nJurong, Singapore (an owned manufacturing facility on leased land)\nAlexandria, Egypt (an owned manufacturing facility)\nWashington, UK (a leased manufacturing facility)\nRassau, UK (a leased manufacturing facility)\nJaboatao, Brazil (an owned manufacturing facility)\nIn addition to the properties identified above, Energizer and its subsidiaries own or operate sales offices, regional offices, storage facilities, distribution centers and terminals and related properties.\nThrough our global supply chain and global manufacturing footprint, we strive to meet diverse consumer demands within each of the markets we serve. Our portfolio of household and specialty batteries, and portable lights, automotive fragrance and appearance products is distributed through a global sales force and global distributor model. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are parties to a number of legal proceedings in various jurisdictions arising out of our business operations in the normal course of business. Many of these legal matters are in preliminary stages and involve complex issues of law and fact, and may proceed for protracted periods of time. The amount of liability, if any, from these proceedings cannot be determined with certainty. However, based upon present information, we believe that our liability, if any, arising from such pending legal proceedings, asserted legal claims and known potential legal claims which are likely to be asserted, are not reasonably likely to be material to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, taking into account established accruals for estimated liabilities.\nSee also the discussion captioned Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters under Item 1 above.

Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nThe Company's Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). As of September 30, 2022, there were approximately 5,010 shareholders of record of the Company's Common Stock under the symbol \"ENR\".\nThe Company expects to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends. However, future dividends are dependent on future earnings, capital requirements and the Company's financial condition and are declared at the sole discretion of the Company's Board of Directors. See Item 1A - Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Common Stock - We cannot guarantee the timing, amount or payment of dividends on our common stock.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Reserved. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion is a summary of the key factors management considers necessary in reviewing the Company's results of operations, operating segment results, and liquidity and capital resources. Statements in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) that are not historical may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nYou should read the following MD&A in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This MD&A contains forward-looking statements. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risk, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. Please see Part I. Item 1A Risk Factors above and Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.\nAll amounts discussed are in millions of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis document contains both historical and forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead reflect our expectations, estimates or projections concerning future results or events, including, without limitation, the future sales, gross margins, costs, earnings, cash flows, tax rates and performance of the Company. These statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"expectation,\" \"anticipate,\" \"may,\" \"could,\" \"intend,\" \"belief,\" \"estimate,\" \"plan,\" \"target,\" \"predict,\" \"likely,\" \"should,\" \"forecast,\" \"outlook,\" or other similar words or phrases. These statements are not guarantees of performance and are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by those statements. We cannot assure you that any of our expectations, estimates or projections will be achieved.

All forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty. Numerous factors could cause our actual results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors,\" as updated from time to time in the Companys SEC filings.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful comparisons to the corresponding historical or future period. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that are not reflective of the Company's on-going operating performance, such as impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs, an acquisition earn out, the costs of the May 2022 flooding of our Brazilian manufacturing facility, the costs of exiting the Russian market, the gain on finance lease termination, the loss on extinguishment of debt and the one-time impact of Tax structuring and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. In addition, these measures help investors to analyze year over year comparability when excluding currency fluctuations, acquisition activity as well as other company initiatives that are not on-going. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are an enhancement to assist investors in understanding our business and in performing analysis consistent with financial models developed by research analysts. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted.\nWe provide the following non-GAAP measures and calculations, as well as the corresponding reconciliation to the closest GAAP measure:\nSegment Profit. This amount represents the operations of our two reportable segments including allocations for shared support functions. General corporate and other expenses, amortization expense, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, the gain on finance lease termination, other items, net, the charges\nrelated to acquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs, an acquisition earn out, the costs of the flooding of our manufacturing facility in Brazil and the costs of exiting the Russian market have all been excluded from segment profit.\nAdjusted net earnings from continuing operations and Adjusted Diluted net earnings per common share - continuing operations (EPS). These measures exclude the impact of the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, costs related to acquisition and integration, restructuring costs, an acquisition earn out, the costs of the flooding of our manufacturing facility in Brazil, the costs of exiting the Russian market, the gain on finance lease termination, the loss on extinguishment of debt and the one-time impact of Tax structuring and the CARES Act.\nNon-GAAP Tax Rate. This is the tax rate when excluding the pre-tax impact of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs, an acquisition earn out, the costs of the flooding of our manufacturing facility in Brazil, the costs of exiting the Russian market, the gain on finance lease termination and the loss on extinguishment of debt, as well as the related tax impact for these items, calculated utilizing the statutory rate for where the impact was incurred, as well as the one-time impact of Tax structuring and the CARES Act.\nOrganic. This is the non-GAAP financial measurement of the change in revenue or segment profit that excludes or otherwise adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, change in Russia and Argentina operations and the impact of currency from the changes in foreign currency exchange rates as defined below:\nImpact of acquisitions. Energizer completed two acquisitions in the first fiscal quarter of 2021, a battery plant in Indonesia on October 1, 2020 and a formulation company in the United States on December 1, 2020 (Formulations Acquisition). These adjustments include the impact each acquisition's on-going operations contributed to each respective income statement caption for the first year's operations directly after the acquisition date. This does not include the impact of acquisition and integration costs.\nChange in Russia Operations. The Company exited the Russian market in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 due to the increased global and economic and political uncertainty resulting from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. This adjusts for the change in Russian sales and segment profit from the prior year post exit.\nChange in Argentina Operations. The Company is presenting separately all changes in sales and segment profit from our Argentina affiliate due to the designation of the economy as highly inflationary as of July 1, 2018.\nImpact of currency. The Company evaluates the operating performance of our Company on a currency neutral basis. The impact of currency is the difference between the value of current year foreign operations at the current period ending USD exchange rate, compared to the value of the current year foreign operations at the prior period ending USD exchange rate, as well as the impact of hedging on the currency fluctuation.\nAdjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin and adjusted Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) as a percent of sales. Details for adjusted gross margin and adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales are also supplemental non-GAAP measure disclosures. These measures exclude the impact of costs related to acquisition and integration, restructuring costs, an acquisition earn out, the costs of exiting the Russian market and the costs of the flooding of our manufacturing facility in Brazil.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19)\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, Energizer continued to be impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its related effects. Overall, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's results of operations was primarily driven by factors related to disruption in our global supply chain and changes in demand for products. While it is not feasible to identify or quantify all the other direct and indirect implications on the Company's results of operations, below are factors that the Company believes have affected its results for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021.\nThe Company has faced higher operating costs due to the global supply chain constraints, including for raw materials and transportation.\nLabor availability continues to be a challenge across most of the Company's sites in the US and Singapore.\nThe Company has invested in incremental safety stock to partially mitigate the impacts of the continued volatility of the global supply network.\nAn inflationary environment marked by higher manufacturing and transportation costs as well as increased commodity costs is expected to continue into fiscal 2023. While we did not experience significant disruptions in our operations during fiscal 2022, the risks of future negative impacts due to transportation, logistical or supply constraints and higher commodity\ncosts for certain raw materials remain present, and the Company continues to experience corresponding incremental costs and gross margin pressures.\nThe full impact of COVID-19 on our financial and operating performance will depend significantly on the duration and severity of the pandemic and related disruption to our global supply chain, the emergence of variants and the effectiveness of vaccines against these variants, and any future government actions affecting consumers and the economy in general, among other factors beyond our knowledge or control.\nFor further discussion of the possible impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and other recent events on our business, financial conditions and results of operations, see \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Report.\nExit of Russian Market\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company exited the Russian market due to global economic and political uncertainty related to the conflict between Russian and the Ukraine and the resultant sanctions imposed on Russia.\nWhile neither Russia nor Ukraine constitutes a material portion of our business, a significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the conflict's current scope could disrupt our supply chain, broaden inflationary costs, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our Russian subsidiary comprised approximately one percent of our business.\nWith the decision to exit the Russian market, the Company terminated the employment of all our Russian colleagues and reviewed our Russian assets for impairment. Exiting the Russian market resulted in additional Costs of products sold of $1.3 related to the impairment of inventory in Russia and shipping costs to get inventory to other markets, impairment of other assets and severance recorded to SG&A of $5.8, and currency impacts recorded in Other items, net of $7.5 in fiscal 2022.\nBrazil Manufacturing Plant Flood\nIn May 2022, the Company's Jaboatao, Brazil battery manufacturing facility had severe flooding due to historic levels of rain in the area. The plant was not operational for the month of June, however some production began again in July and the majority is now back on line. The Company has an insurance policy with an approximate $10 deductible. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recorded costs related to the flood net of insurance proceeds of $9.7 in Cost of products sold, primarily related to damaged inventory at the plant. Based on the insurance plan deductible, the Company anticipates that further losses from the damage should be minimal.\nFiscal Year 2021 Acquisitions\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with FDK Corporation to acquire its subsidiary PT FDK Indonesia, a battery manufacturing facility (FDK Acquisition). On October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition for a contractual purchase price of $18.2. After contractual and working capital adjustments, the Company paid cash of $16.9 and a working capital adjustment of $0.7 during fiscal 2021. The acquisition of the FDK Indonesia facility increased the Company's alkaline battery production capacity and allows us to avoid future planned capital expenditures.\nOn December 1, 2020 the Company acquired a North Carolina-based company that specializes in developing formulations for cleaning tasks. Their products are both sold to customers directly and licensed to manufacturers. This acquisition is expected to bring significant innovation capabilities in formulations to our organization. The purchase price and total cash paid for the acquisition was $51.2. During fiscal 2022, the working capital settlement was finalized, reducing the purchase price by $1.0.\nBattery Acquisition\nOn January 2, 2019, the Company acquired Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc.'s (Spectrum) global battery, lighting and portable power business (Battery Acquisition) including the brands Rayovac\u00ae and Varta\u00ae (Acquired Battery Business). The acquisition expanded our battery portfolio globally with the addition of a strong value brand.\nOn January 2, 2020, the Company sold the Varta\u00ae consumer battery business in the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, including manufacturing and distribution facilities in Germany (Varta Divestiture or Divestment Business) to VARTA Aktiengesellschaft (VARTA AG). These operations were included as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nAuto Care Acquisition\nOn January 28, 2019, the Company acquired Spectrums global auto care business, including Armor All\u00ae, STP\u00ae, and A/C PRO\u00ae brands (Auto Care Acquisition).\nAcquisition and Integration Costs\nThe Company incurred pre-tax acquisition and integration costs related to the above acquisitions of $16.5, $68.9 and $68.0 in the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nPre-tax costs recorded in Costs of products sold were $6.0, $33.7, and $32.0 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, which primarily related to the integration restructuring costs of $5.2, $31.9 and $29.3 as discussed in Note 6, Restructuring.\nPre-tax acquisition and integration costs recorded in SG&A were $9.4, $40.0 and $38.8 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In fiscal 2022 the SG&A expenses primarily related to the integration of acquired information technology systems, consulting costs, and retention-related compensation costs. In fiscal 2021 and 2020 these expenses primarily related to consulting fees for the 2020 restructuring program, success incentives, and costs of integrating the information technology systems of the Battery and Auto Care Acquisition businesses.\nFor the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 the Company recorded $1.1, $1.1 and $1.3 in Research and development, respectively.\nIncluded in Other items, net was pre-tax income of $5.9 and $4.1 in the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The pre-tax income recorded in fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by the gain on a sale of assets of $3.3, which was part of the integration restructuring discussed in Note 6.\nThe pre-tax income recorded in fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by pre-acquisition insurance proceeds of $4.9 and $1.0 gain on the sale of assets and $0.9 of transition services income, offset by a $2.2 loss related to the hedge contract on the proceeds from the Varta Divestiture and $0.5 of other items.\nRestructuring Costs\nSubsequent to the fiscal year-end, the Board of Directors approved a profit recovery program, Project Momentum, which includes an enterprise-wide restructuring focused on recovering operating margins, optimizing our manufacturing, distribution and global supply chain networks, and enhancing our organizational efficiency across both segments. The restructuring component of the program is expected to generate $65 to $80 of annual pre-tax savings and the Company estimates that it will incur one-time costs of $40 to $50 over the next two years. During the fourth quarter, the Company accrued $0.9 of consulting costs related to the design of the program. Additionally, along side the restructuring component of the program, Project Momentum includes continuous improvement and working capital initiatives that are designed to strengthen our balance sheet, focus on cash flow, and generate P&L savings of approximately $15 to $20 annually. Total expected pre-tax savings of Project Momentum are between $80 and $100 with approximately $30 to $40 of those savings to be recognized in fiscal year 2023.\nIn the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019, the Company began implementing restructuring related integration plans for our manufacturing and distribution networks. These plans include the closure and combination of distribution and manufacturing facilities in order to reduce complexity and realize greater efficiencies in our manufacturing, packaging and distribution processes. All activities within this plan were substantially complete by December 31, 2021.\nPart of this plan was the exit of our Dixon, IL leased packaging facility, which the Company vacated during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company entered into a termination agreement with the landlord. The Company terminated the lease agreement, which went into 2028, reducing the finance lease obligations by $9.8. The termination agreement required the Company to pay a termination fee of $4.0, as well as decommissioning costs and brokerage fees. Since the Company has already vacated the facility as part of the 2019 restructuring program, most assets associated with the location have already been fully depreciated. The termination of this lease resulted in a gain of $4.5 recognized in Other items, net during fiscal 2022.\nIn the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020, the Company initiated a new restructuring program with a primary focus on reorganizing our global end-to-end supply chain network and ensuring accountability by category. This program includes streamlining the Companys end-to-end supply chain model to enable rapid response to category specific demands and enhancing our ability to better serve our customers. Planning and execution of this program began in fiscal year 2021, with all programs substantially complete by December 31, 2021.\nThe total pre-tax expense related to these restructuring plans for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $1.7, $36.8, and $30.3, respectively. These consisted of charges for employee severance, retention, related benefit costs, accelerated depreciation, asset write-offs, relocation, environmental investigatory and mitigation costs, consulting costs and other exit costs, offset by a gain on finance lease termination in fiscal 2022. The costs were reflected in Cost of products sold, Selling, general and administrative expense, Research and development, and Other items, net on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income.\nAlthough the Company's restructuring costs are recorded outside of segment profit, if allocated to our new reportable segments, the restructuring costs noted above fiscal 2022 would have been included in our Batteries & Lights and Auto Care segments in the amount of $1.3 and $0.4, respectively. The restructuring costs noted above for fiscal year 2021 would have been included in our Batteries & Lights and Auto Care segments in the amount of $30.7 and $6.1, respectively. The restructuring costs noted above for fiscal year 2020 would have been incurred within our Batteries & Lights and Auto Care segments in the amount of $21.7 and $8.6, respectively.\nTotal pre-tax charges relating to the 2019 restructuring program since inception were $60.6. Total pre-tax charges relating to the 2020 restructuring program since inception are $19.4.\nFiscal 2022 marks the conclusion of the 2019 and 2020 Restructuring programs. The full amount of savings are now included within our run-rate cost structure. Energizer estimates that total project savings were approximately $55 to $60. The primary impact of the savings were reflected in Cost of products sold. Savings related to the restructuring programs have been fully realized as of September 30, 2022. We do not expect to incur additional material charges for these programs.\nRefer to Note 6 Restructuring for further detail.\nOverview\nGeneral\nEnergizer, through its operating subsidiaries, is one of the worlds largest manufacturers, marketers and distributors of household batteries, specialty batteries and lighting products, and a leading designer and marketer of automotive appearance, performance, refrigerant, and freshener products.

Organic net sales increased 3.1% primarily due to:\nPricing executed in both battery and auto care drove an organic increase of approximately 7.6%; and\nNew distribution globally across both battery and auto care contributed approximately 0.8% to organic growth.\nOffsetting these increases was a net volume decrease of approximately 5.3% as a result of lapping the elevated battery demand in the prior year and declines in both battery and auto care related to the previously mentioned pricing actions.\nNet sales for the year ended September 30, 2021 were $3,021.5, an increase of 10.1%. Organic net sales increased 7.3% primarily due to:\nNew distribution globally and across both reportable segments, contributed approximately 3.9% of the increase;\nIncreased year over year global demand contributed approximately 2.6%, driven by higher battery sales earlier in the fiscal year and increased auto care sales throughout the fiscal year; and\nFavorable pricing contributed approximately 0.8% to the organic increase.\nFor further discussion regarding net sales in each of our reportable product segments, including a summary of reported versus organic changes, please see the section titled Segment Results provided below.\nGross Profit\nGross profit dollars were $1,119.5 in fiscal 2022 versus $1,161.4 in fiscal 2021. Excluding the current and prior year acquisition and integration costs of $6.0 and $33.7, respectively, and the current year impact of costs from the flooding of our Brazilian manufacturing facility of $9.7 and exiting the Russian market of $1.3, gross profit dollars were $1,136.5 in fiscal 2022 versus $1,195.1 in fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross profit dollars was driven by higher operating costs, including transportation, material and labor costs, consistent with ongoing inflationary trends. The later part of fiscal 2022 was further impacted by operating inefficiencies related to reduced production volumes as the Company lowered overall inventory levels on hand. Partially offsetting these margin impacts was the positive impact of executed price increases in battery and auto care, the elimination of prior year COVID-19 costs and synergies of approximately $6.\nGross profit dollars were $1,161.4 in fiscal 2021 versus $1,081.9 in fiscal 2020. Excluding the current and prior year acquisition and integration costs of $33.7 and $32.0, respectively, gross profit dollars were $1,195.1 in fiscal 2021 versus $1,113.9 in fiscal 2020. The increase in gross profit dollars was due to the organic revenue growth discussed above, impact of FY21 acquisitions and approximately $50 of synergies achieved during the year, partially offset by the higher input costs, including labor, commodities, tariffs and transportation costs, consistent with ongoing inflationary trends.\nGross margin as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2022 was 36.7% versus 38.4% in the prior year. Excluding the current and prior year acquisition and integration costs, and the current year impact of costs from the flooding of our Brazilian manufacturing facility and exiting the Russian market, gross margin was 37.3%, down 230 basis points from prior year. Gross margin as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2021 was 38.4% versus 39.4% in the prior year. Excluding the current and prior year acquisition and integration costs, gross margin was 39.6%, down 100 basis points from prior year.\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2021\nReported Adjusted Reported Adjusted\nGross Margin - Beg of Year\n38.4 % 39.6 % 39.4 % 40.6 %\nPricing 4.3 % 4.3 % - % - %\nMix impacts - % - % (0.6) % (0.6) %\nProduct cost impacts (5.8) % (5.8) % (2.8) % (2.8) %\nReduction in integration costs, net of Brazil flood and Russia exit impact 0.6 % - % (0.1) % - %\nLower margin rate profile of the FY 21 acquired businesses - % - % (0.2) % (0.2) %\nReduction of FY COVID-19 cost impact 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.6 % 0.6 %\nSynergy realization 0.2 % 0.2 % 1.8 % 1.8 %\nCurrency impact and other (1.4) % (1.4) % 0.3 % 0.2 %\nGross Margin - End of Year\n36.7 % 37.3 % 38.4 % 39.6 %\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A)\nSG&A expenses were $484.5 in fiscal 2022, or 15.9% of net sales, as compared to $487.2, or 16.1% of net sales for fiscal 2021, and $483.3, or 17.6% of net sales for fiscal 2020. Included in SG&A in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were acquisition and integration costs of $9.4, $40.0 and $38.8, respectively. Fiscal 2022 and 2021 also included an acquisition earn out of $1.1 and $3.4, respectively, related to the Formulations Acquisition. Fiscal 2022 also included $5.8 related to the exit of the Russian market and $0.9 of Project Momentum consulting costs.\nIn fiscal 2022, SG&A excluding acquisition and integration costs, the earn out, costs from exiting the Russian market and Project Momentum costs was $467.3 or 15.3%, compared to fiscal 2021 of $443.8 or 14.7%. The increase was primarily driven by increased environmental costs related to a legacy facility that has been sold by the Company, recycling fees, travel and higher IT spending related to our investment in digital transformation.\nIn fiscal 2021, SG&A excluding acquisition and integration costs was $443.8 or 14.7%, compared to fiscal 2020 of $444.5 or 16.2%. The decrease, as a percent of Net sales, was driven by synergy realization and higher net sales while SG&A expense remained consistent with prior year.\nAdvertising and Sales Promotion (A&P)\nA&P was $137.1 in fiscal 2022, a decrease of $25.0 as compared to fiscal 2021. A&P as a percent of net sales was 4.5%, 5.4% and 5.4% in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nResearch and Development\nR&D expense was $34.7 in fiscal 2022, $34.5 in fiscal 2021, $35.4 in fiscal 2020. As a percent of net sales, R&D expense was consistent as a percentage of sales at 1.1% in fiscal 2022, 1.1% in fiscal 2021, and 1.3% in fiscal 2020.\nAmortization Expense\nAmortization expense for fiscal 2022 was $61.1 compared to $61.2 in fiscal 2021 and $56.5 in fiscal 2020. The fiscal 2022 and 2021 results included the full year of amortization on the Custom Accessories Europe (CAE) acquisition, as well as amortization for the Formulations Acquisition, discussed in Note 4.\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets for fiscal 2022 was $541.9. This included a non-cash impairment on the Armor All trade name of $370.4, STP trade name of $26.3, Rayovac trade name of $127.8 and a non-cash impairment related to the Auto Care International reporting unit goodwill of $17.4. For Armor All and STP, the non-cash impairments were primarily due to declines in their respective Auto Care category projections late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, significant increases in input costs, and a higher discount rate. The Rayovac non-cash impairment was primarily caused by significant sustained currency headwinds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which are expected to continue into fiscal 2023, a decrease in the\nbranded sales forecast, increases in input costs, and a higher discount rate. The goodwill non-cash impairment was primarily driven by significant sustained currency headwinds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which are expected to continue into fiscal 2023, declines in the Auto Care category projections late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, and an increased discount rate.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for fiscal 2022 was $158.4, as compared to fiscal 2021 expense of $161.8 and $195.0 in fiscal 2020. The Company took advantage of favorable debt markets in fiscal 2021 and 2020 and refinanced its long-term debt resulting in a decline of interest expense of $3.4 in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 and $33.2 in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nThe Loss on the extinguishment of debt was $103.3 for fiscal year 2021 and relates to the Company's refinancing of its \u20ac650.0 Senior Notes due in 2026 in June 2021, the redemption of the $600.0 Senior Notes due in 2027 in January 2021 and the term loan refinancing in December 2020. The Company also amended certain covenants in its credit agreement, which created additional capacity and flexibility.\nThe Loss on the extinguishment of debt was $94.9 for fiscal year 2020 and relates to the Company's July 2020 redemption of its $600.0 Senior Notes due in 2025 and the redemption of the $750.0 Senior Notes due in 2026, which were redeemed subsequent to year-end on October 16, 2020. The loss also includes the write off of deferred financing fees related to the term loan refinancing in December 2019.\nOther Items, Net\nOther items, net was expense of $7.3, income of $2.9 and expense of $2.0 in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and is summarized below:\nFor the Years Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nOther items, net\nInterest income\n$ (1.0) $ (0.7) $ (0.6)\nForeign currency exchange loss\n7.8 5.5 8.7\nPension benefit other than service costs\n(4.1) (1.9) (1.7)\nAcquisition foreign currency loss - - 2.2\nPre-acquisition insurance proceeds - - (4.9)\nExit of Russian market 7.5 - -\nGain on finance lease termination (4.5) - -\nTransition services agreement income - - (0.9)\nGain on sale of assets - (3.3) (1.0)\nOther\n1.6 (2.5) 0.2\nTotal Other items, net\n$ 7.3 $ (2.9) $ 2.0\nIncome Taxes\nFor fiscal 2022, the effective tax rate was a benefit of 24.2%. The current year rate was unfavorably impacted by the tax impact of the goodwill impairment. Excluding the impact of our non-GAAP adjustments, the year to date adjusted effective tax rate was 19.5% as compared to 22.6% in the prior year. The decrease in the rate versus prior year is primarily due to the release of reserves from statute limitations and settlements with tax authorities.\nFor fiscal 2021, the effective tax rate was a benefit of 4.3%. The current year rate was favorably impacted by tax structuring resulting in a reduction to a deferred tax liability and the favorable tax impact resulting from the refinancing of the \u20ac650.0 Senior Notes due in 2026 in June 2021. Excluding the impact of our non-GAAP adjustments, the year to date adjusted effective tax rate was 22.6% as compared to 23.3% in the prior year. The decrease in the rate versus prior year is due to the favorable return to provision adjustments and decreases in certain limited expenses.\nFor fiscal 2020, the effective tax rate was 30.9%. The current year rate includes costs related to acquisition and integration in addition to the unfavorable impact of $1.8 for the CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and provides, among other things, increased interest deduction limitations to companies which can decrease overall cash taxes paid. Excluding the impact of these non-GAAP adjustments, the year to date adjusted effective tax rate was 23.3% as compared to 18.5% in the prior year. The increase in the rate versus prior year is due to the country mix of earnings which drove a higher foreign tax rate as well as the expiration of certain tax holidays in foreign jurisdictions.\nEnergizers effective tax rate is highly sensitive to the mix of countries from which earnings or losses are derived. Declines in earnings in lower tax rate countries, earnings increases in higher tax rate countries, repatriation of foreign earnings or foreign operating losses in the future could increase future tax rates. In addition, the enactment of legislation implementing changes in the U.S. on the taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other U.S. tax reform could impact our effective tax rate in the future.\nArgentina Hyperinflation\nEffective July 1, 2018, the financial statements for our Argentina subsidiary are consolidated under the rules governing the translation of financial information in a highly inflationary economy. Under U.S. GAAP, an economy is considered highly inflationary if the cumulative inflation rate for a three year period meets or exceeds 100 percent. The Argentina economy exceeded the three year cumulative inflation rate of 100 percent as of June 2018. If a subsidiary is considered to be in a highly inflationary economy, the financial statements of the subsidiary must be remeasured into the Companys reporting currency (U.S. dollar) and future exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in current earnings, rather than exclusively in the equity section of the balance sheet, until such time as the economy is no longer considered highly inflationary. It is difficult to determine what continuing impact the use of highly inflationary accounting for Argentina may have on our consolidated financial statements as such impact is dependent upon movements in the applicable exchange rates between the local currency and the U.S. dollar and the amount of monetary assets and liabilities included in our affiliates balance sheet.\nSegment Results\nAs of October 1, 2021, the Company changed its reportable operating segments from two geographical segments, previously Americas and International, to two product groupings, Battery & Lights and Auto Care. This change came with the completion of the Battery and Auto Care Acquisition integrations in fiscal 2022. The Company changed its reporting structure to better reflect what the chief operating decision maker is reviewing to make organizational decisions and resource allocations. The Company has recast the information for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 to align with this presentation.\nSegment performance is evaluated based on segment operating profit, exclusive of general corporate expenses (including share-based compensation costs), amortization of intangibles, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, acquisition and integration activities, including restructuring charges, acquisition earn out, the costs of the flooding of our manufacturing facility in Brazil, the costs of exiting the Russian market, and other items determined to be corporate in nature. Financial items, such as interest income and expense, gain on finance lease termination and loss on extinguishment of debt are managed on a global basis at the corporate level. The exclusion of acquisition and integration and restructuring costs from segment results reflects managements view on how it evaluates segment performance. The Company also excludes amortization of intangibles and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets from segments as these are non-cash items related to the original purchase of the intangibles and not utilized to evaluate current segment performance.\nEnergizers operating model includes a combination of standalone and shared business functions between the product segments, varying by country and region of the world. Shared functions include the sales and marketing functions, as well as human resources, IT and finance shared service costs. Energizer applies a fully allocated cost basis, in which shared business functions are allocated between segments. Such allocations are estimates, and do not represent the costs of such services if performed on a standalone basis.\nSegment Net Sales For the Years Ended September 30,\n2022 % Chg 2021 % Chg\nBatteries & Lights\nNet sales - prior year $ 2,402.8 $ 2,223.5\nOrganic 84.8 3.5 % 113.3 5.1 %\nChange in Russia operations (19.0) (0.8) % - - %\nImpact of FY21 Acquisitions - - % 23.3 1.0 %\nChange in Argentina operations 11.8 0.5 % 6.8 0.3 %\nImpact of currency (53.1) (2.2) % 35.9 1.7 %\nNet sales - current year $ 2,427.3 1.0 % $ 2,402.8 8.1 %\nAuto Care\nNet sales - prior year $ 618.7 $ 521.3\nOrganic 9.6 1.6 % 87.2 16.7 %\nChange in Russia operations (0.3) - % - - %\nImpact of FY21 Acquisitions - - % 3.7 0.7 %\nChange in Argentina operations 0.1 - % - - %\nImpact of currency (5.3) (0.9) % 6.5 1.3 %\nNet sales - current year $ 622.8 0.7 % $ 618.7 18.7 %\nTotal Net Sales\nNet sales - prior year $ 3,021.5 $ 2,744.8\nOrganic 94.4 3.1 % 200.5 7.3 %\nChange in Russia operations (19.3) (0.6) % - - %\nImpact of FY21 Acquisitions - - % 27.0 1.0 %\nChange in Argentina operations 11.9 0.4 % 6.8 0.2 %\nImpact of currency (58.4) (2.0) % 42.4 1.6 %\nNet sales - current year $ 3,050.1 0.9 % $ 3,021.5 10.1 %\nTotal net sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 increased 0.9%, due to organic sales increase of $94.4, or 3.1%, and an $11.9 increase from our Argentina operations, which were deemed to be highly inflationary. Partially offsetting these increases was the decrease in sales from exiting the Russian market of $19.3, or 0.6%, and unfavorable impact of currency of $58.4, or 2.0%. Segment sales results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 are as follows:\nBatteries & Lights net sales improved 1.0% versus the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily driven by organic net sales growth of 3.5% due to pricing increases (approximately 7.5%) and new distribution in battery & lights (approximately 0.5%). This was partially offset by the expected decline in battery demand compared to the elevated COVID-19 related sales in the prior year period (approximately 4.5%).\nAuto Care net sales improved 0.7% versus the prior fiscal year. This increase was driven by organic net sales growth of 1.6% due to global price increases (approximately 8.0%) and new distribution in both the North American and International markets (approximately 1.5%). This was offset by a decrease in volumes to prior year related to the previously mentioned pricing actions, the lapping of elevated demand in the prior year and the negative impact higher gas prices had on miles driven, consumer foot traffic in the category, and a tendency to defer auto maintenance, particularly impacting our AC recharge business (approximately 8.0%).\nTotal net sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 increased 10.1%, including organic sales increase\nof $200.5, or 7.3%, sales related to the FY21 acquisitions of $27.0, or 1.0%, a $6.8 increase from our Argentina operations, which were deemed to be highly inflationary, and favorable impact of currency of $42.4, or 1.6%. Segment sales results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 are as follows:\nBattery & Lights net sales improved 8.1% versus the prior fiscal year. This increase was driven by organic net sales growth of 5.1% due to distribution gains primarily in North and Latin America (approximately 3.0%),\nstrong replenishment due to elevated COVID-19 demand primarily in the International markets (approximately 1.5%) and favorable pricing (approximately 1.0%).\nAuto Care net sales improved 18.7% versus the prior fiscal year. This increase was driven by organic net sales growth of 16.7% due to increased distribution gains (approximately 8.5%) and strong replenishment (approximately 7.0%) primarily in North America, as well as favorable pricing (approximately 1.0%).\nSegment Profit For the Years Ended September 30,\n2022 % Chg 2021 % Chg\nBatteries & Lights\nSegment Profit - prior year $ 553.6 $ 512.6\nOrganic 14.6 2.6 % 23.8 4.6 %\nChange in Russia operations (4.0) (0.7) % - - %\nImpact of FY21 Acquisitions - - % 1.4 0.3 %\nChange in Argentina operations 9.6 1.7 % 5.8 1.1 %\nImpact of currency (20.2) (3.6) % 10.0 2.0 %\nSegment Profit - current year $ 553.6 - % $ 553.6 8.0 %\nAuto Care\nSegment Profit - prior year $ 98.2 $ 79.4\nOrganic (48.2) (49.1) % 13.6 17.1 %\nChange in Russia operations - - % - - %\nImpact of FY21 Acquisitions - - % 1.1 1.4 %\nChange in Argentina operations 0.1 0.1 % 0 - %\nImpact of currency (3.6) (3.5) % 4.1 5.2 %\nSegment Profit - current year $ 46.5 (52.6) % $ 98.2 23.7 %\nTotal Segment Profit\nSegment Profit - prior year $ 651.8 $ 592.0\nOrganic (33.6) (5.2) % 37.4 6.3 %\nChange in Russia operations (4.0) (0.6) % - - %\nImpact of FY21 Acquisitions - - % 2.5 0.4 %\nChange in Argentina operations 9.7 1.5 % 5.8 1.0 %\nImpact of currency (23.8) (3.6) % 14.1 2.4 %\nSegment Profit - current year $ 600.1 (7.9) % $ 651.8 10.1 %\nRefer to Note 10, Segments, in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation from segment profit to (Loss)/earnings before income taxes.\nTotal segment profit in fiscal 2022 was $600.1, a decrease of 7.9% versus the prior fiscal year. The decline was driven by organic segment profit decrease of 5.2%, unfavorable movement in foreign currency of $23.8, or 3.6% and the change in Russian operating profit of $4.0 from exiting the Russian market. These decreases were offset by $9.7, or 1.5%, of favorable changes in Argentina operations. Segment operating profit results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 are as follows:\nBattery & Lights segment profit was $553.6, flat versus the prior fiscal year. The organic profit increase was $14.6, or 2.6%, and was driven by top-line growth and lower A&P spending. This growth was partially offset by increased operating costs including higher labor, tariffs and transportation costs, which unfavorably impacted gross margin, as well as higher overhead spending.\nAuto Care segment profit was $46.5, a decrease of $51.7, or 52.6%, versus the prior fiscal year. Organic segment profit decreased $48.2, or 49.1%. The organic revenue growth in Auto Care noted above was not enough to offset the increased product input costs which negatively impacted gross margin. Partially offsetting this decline was lower A&P.\nTotal segment profit in fiscal 2021 was $651.8, an increase of 10.1% versus the prior fiscal year, driven by an\nincrease of $2.5, or 0.4% from the impact of FY21 acquisitions, organic segment profit improvement of 6.3%, favorable movement in foreign currency of $14.1, or 2.4% and favorable changes in Argentina operations of $5.8, or 1.0%. Segment operating profit results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 are as follows:\nBattery & Lights segment profit was $553.6, an increase of $41.0, or 8.0%, versus the prior fiscal year. The organic segment profit increased $23.8, or 4.6%, driven by top-line net sales growth. This was partially offset by higher operating costs, which unfavorably impacted gross margin as well as planned higher A&P spending.\nAuto Care segment profit was $98.2, an increase of $18.8, or 23.7%, versus the prior fiscal year. The organic segment profit increased $13.6, or 17.1%, driven by top-line net sales growth. This was partially offset by higher overhead spending and planned higher A&P spending in the period.\nGENERAL CORPORATE For the Years Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nGeneral corporate and other expenses $ 101.6 $ 96.0 $ 103.8\n% of net sales 3.3 % 3.2 % 3.8 %\nFor fiscal 2022, general corporate expenses were $101.6, an increase of $5.6 compared to fiscal 2021 expense of $96.0. The increase was driven by increased travel expense, and increased bonus and stock compensation expense, partially offset by lower mark to market expense on our deferred compensation plans. For fiscal 2021, general corporate expenses were $96.0, a decrease of $7.8 compared to fiscal 2020 expense of $103.8. The decrease was driven by synergy realization, a reduction in compensation expense and reduced spending, due in part to travel restrictions imposed as a result of COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by higher legal and corporate development costs and mark to market expenses on our deferred compensation plans.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nEnergizers primary future cash needs are centered on operating activities, working capital and strategic investments. We believe that our future cash from operations, together with our access to capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund our short-term and long-term operating and financing needs. Our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to: (i) our financial condition and prospects, (ii) for debt, our credit rating, (iii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (iv) the current state of the economy. There can be no assurances that we will continue to have access to capital markets on terms acceptable to us. See Risk Factors for a further discussion.\nCash is managed centrally with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds. At September 30, 2022, Energizer had $205.3 of cash and cash equivalents, approximately 74% of which was outside of the U.S. Given our extensive international operations, a significant portion of our cash is denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to regulatory capital requirements, however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations.\nOn December 22, 2020, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (2020 Credit Agreement) which provided for a 5-year $400.0 revolving credit facility (2020 Revolving Facility) and a $1,200.0 Term Loan due December 2027. On December 31, 2021 the Company amended the Credit Agreement to increase the 2020 Revolving Facility to $500.0.\nThe borrowings under the Term Loan require quarterly principal payments at a rate of 0.25% of the original principal balance. Borrowings under the 2020 Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of the Company, LIBOR or the Base Rate (as defined) plus the applicable margin. The Term Loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of the Company, LIBOR or Base Rate (as defined) plus the applicable margin.\nThe 2020 Revolving Facility replaced the previously outstanding Revolving Credit Facility entered into in 2018. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the 2020 Revolving Facility and $8.0 of outstanding letters of credit. Taking into account outstanding letters of credit, $492.0 remained available as of September 30, 2022.\nDebt Covenants\nThe agreements governing the Company's debt contain certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and provisions relating to events of default. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants or with other requirements of these agreements, the lenders may have the right to accelerate the maturity of the debt. Acceleration under one of these facilities would trigger cross defaults to other borrowings. As of September 30, 2022, the Company was in compliance with the provisions and covenants associated with its debt agreements, and expects to remain in compliance for the next 12 months.\nOperating Activities\nCash flow from operating activities from continuing operations is the primary funding source for operating needs and capital investments. Cash flow from operating activities was $1.0 in fiscal 2022, $179.7 in fiscal 2021, and $389.3 in fiscal 2020.\nCash flow from operating activities from continuing operations was $1.0 in fiscal 2022 as compared to $179.7 in the prior fiscal year. This decrease of $178.7 was primarily driven by working capital changes year over year of approximately $165. The working capital change of approximately $165 was primarily a result of the following:\nApproximately $195 in increased accounts receivable due to higher current year sales compared to prior year and reduced factoring relating to those accounts receivables, offset by approximately $29 of changes in accrued sales allowances.\nApproximately $161 due to changes in accounts payable, offset by approximately $26 due to changes in accrued interest, both of which were driven by timing of payments.\nThese changes were partially offset by approximately $118 less of an inventory investment compared to the prior year as the Company was proactively building safety stock in the prior year and reduced the investment in the current year as inventory levels return to a more normalized level.\nCash flow from operating activities from continuing operations was $179.7 in fiscal 2021 as compared to $389.3 in fiscal 2020. This change of $209.6 was primarily driven by working capital changes year over year of approximately $282, partially offset by the increase in cash earnings of approximately $97. The working capital change of approximately $282 was primarily a result of the following:\nApproximately $172 in increased inventory investment compared to the prior year as we have taken a proactive approach to invest in incremental safety stock given the continued volatility of the global supply network-including uncertainty around product sourcing, transportation challenges and labor availability;\nApproximately $45 due to changes in accounts payable and accrued interest driven by timing of payments;\nApproximately $38 in accounts receivable due to higher current year sales compared to prior year; and\nThe prior year receipt of approximately $30 related to the agreement and final cash settlement from the Central Authority in Spain on a Spanish VAT refund payment.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used by investing activities from continuing operations was $90.9 in fiscal 2022 and $126.4 in fiscal 2021, and $64.0 in fiscal 2020, and consisted of the following:\nCapital expenditures were $77.8, $64.9, and $65.3 in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nProceeds from asset sales were $0.6, $5.7, and $6.4 in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The fiscal 2021 proceeds primarily related to the sale of our Guatemala manufacturing facility acquired with the Battery Acquisition. The fiscal 2020 proceeds primarily represent insurance proceeds received from property, plant and equipment utilized by the Acquired Battery Business damaged in a flood.\nAcquisitions of intangible assets of $14.7 relating to the auto care appearance trade names and formulas acquired in Latin America during fiscal 2022.\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired and working capital payments, were an inflow of $1.0 in fiscal 2022, and outflow of, $67.2, and $5.1 in fiscal 2021, and 2020, respectively. The fiscal 2022 inflow was from the Formulations Acquisition working capital settlement. The fiscal 2021 payments related to the acquired Indonesia battery plant and the Formulations Acquisition. The majority of the fiscal 2020 payment was due to the finalization of working capital adjustments with Spectrum for the Auto Care Acquisition while $1.5 was utilized to complete the CAE acquisition.\nInvesting cash outflows of approximately $55 to $65 are anticipated in fiscal 2023 for capital expenditures relating to maintenance, product development and cost reduction investments.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash from financing activities from continuing operations was $79.1 in fiscal 2022 and $394.2 in fiscal 2020. Net used by financing activities from continuing operations was $1,069.1 in fiscal 2021.\nFor fiscal 2022, cash flow from financing activities from continuing operations consists of the following:\nCash proceeds from issuance of debt with original maturities greater than 90 days of $300.0 relating to the new Senior Notes due in 2027 issuance in the second quarter of fiscal 2022;\nPayments on debt with maturities greater than 90 days of $13.7, primarily related to the quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan;\nNet decrease in debt with original maturities of 90 days or less of $99.0, primarily related to repayments of borrowings under our 2020 Revolving Facility;\nDebt issuance costs of $7.6 relating to the amendment of the Credit Agreement in December 2021 and the issuance of the $300.0 Senior Notes due in 2027;\nPayments to terminate finance lease obligations of $5.1 related to the termination of our Dixon IL packaging facility lease;\nDividends paid on common stock of $84.9 during fiscal 2022 (see below);\nDividends paid on Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (MCPS) of $8.1 during fiscal 2022 (see below); and\nTaxes paid for withheld share-based payments of $2.5.\nFor fiscal 2021, cash flow from financing activities from continuing operations consists of the following:\nCash proceeds from issuance of debt with original maturities greater than 90 days of $1,982.6 relating to the Term Loan funded in December 2020 and January 2021, and the June 2021 issuance of \u20ac650.0 Senior Notes due in 2029 (2029 EUR Notes);\nPayments on debt with maturities greater than 90 days of $2,773.8, primarily related to the October 2020 repayment of the $750.0 Senior Notes due in 2026 (2026 Notes), the $319.4 repayment of the Term Loan A and $313.5 Term Loan B in December 2020, the January 2021 repayment of the $600.0 Senior Notes due in 2027 (2027 Notes), and the June 2021 repayment of the \u20ac650.0 Senior Notes due in 2026 (2026 EUR Notes);\nNet increase in debt with original maturities of 90 days or less of $102.1, primarily related to borrowings under our 2020 Revolving Facility;\nDebt issuance costs of $29.0 relating to the funding of the Term Loan in December 2020 and January 2021 and the 2029 EUR Notes in June 2021;\nPremiums paid on extinguishment of debt of $141.1 funded the October 2020 redemption of the 2026 Notes, the January 2021 redemption of the 2027 Notes, and the June 2021 repayment of the 2026 EUR Notes;\nDividends paid on common stock of $83.9 during fiscal 2021;\nDividends paid on Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (MCPS) of $16.2 during fiscal 2021;\nPurchase of treasury stock of $96.3 representing the cash paid for stock repurchases including the $75.0 Accelerated Share Repurchase program;\nPayment of contingent consideration of $6.8 related to the achievement of a CAE acquisition earn out threshold; and\nTaxes paid for withheld share-based payments of $6.7.\nFor fiscal 2020, cash flow from financing activities from continuing operations consists of the following:\nCash proceeds from issuance of debt with original maturities greater than 90 days of $2,020.6 related to the December 2019 refinancing of $365.0 of the 2018 Term Loan, the April 2020 add on offering of $250.0 of our 6.375% Senior Notes due in 2026, the July 2020 offering of $600.0 of our 4.750% Senior Notes due in 2028 and the September 2020 offering of $800.0 of our 4.375% Senior Notes due in 2029;\nPayments on debt with maturities greater than 90 days of $1,393.5, related to the Term Loan refinancing in December 2019, the repayment of $345.8 of debt from the proceeds of the Varta divestiture, the redemption of $600.0 of our 5.50% Senior Notes due 2025 as well as required quarterly payments on the 2018 Term Loan A and 2018 Term Loan B;\nPayments of debt with maturities of 90 days or less of $30.2, primarily related to repayment of borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility;\nDebt issuance costs of $26.5 relating to our Term Loan refinancing, the add on offering of $250.0 of our 6.37% Senior Notes due in 2026, the offering of $600.0 of our 4.750% Senior Notes due in 2028 and an offering of $800.0 of our 4.375% Senior Notes due in 2029;\nPremiums paid on extinguishment of debt of $18.3 relate to the redemption of our $600.0 5.50% Senior Notes due in 2025 that occurred in July 2020;\nDividends paid on common stock of $85.4 during fiscal 2020;\nDividends paid on MCPS of $16.2 during fiscal 2020;\nPurchase of treasury stock representing the cash paid for stock repurchases under the current authorization during the twelve months ended September 30, 2020; and\nTaxes paid for withheld share-based payments of $11.3.\nDividends\nTotal dividends declared to common shareholders were $85.5, and $84.9 was paid in fiscal 2022. For preferred shareholders, total dividends declared $4.0 and paid to preferred shareholders were $8.1. The payment included an accrued dividend from fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2022 all of the MCPS automatically converted to approximately 4.7 million of the Company's common stock and no additional dividends will be paid on the MCPS.\nSubsequent to the fiscal year end, on November 7, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 of $0.30 per share of common stock, payable on December 16, 2022, to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 28, 2022.\nShare Repurchases\nIn November 2020, the Company's Board of Directors approved an authorization for Energizer to acquire up to 7.5 million shares of its common stock. The Company entered into a $75.0 accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Under the terms of the agreement, approximately 1.5 million shares were delivered in fiscal 2021\nand an additional 0.5 million were delivered upon termination of the agreement on November 18, 2021. The Company acquired in total approximately 2.0 million shares at an average weighted price of $38.30 under the ASR. No additional shares were repurchased in fiscal 2022.\nFuture share repurchase, if any, would be made on the open market and the timing and the amount of any purchases will be determined by the Company based on its evaluation of the market conditions, capital allocation objectives, legal and regulatory requirements and other factors. Share repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) which, among other changes, created a new corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) based on adjusted financial statement income and imposes a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The effective date of these provisions is January 1, 2023. The Company does not expect the enactment of the IRA will have an impact on the Companys financial statements in 2022. Any excise tax incurred on corporate stock repurchases will generally be recognized as part of the cost basis of the treasury stock acquired and not reported as part of income tax expense.\nThe timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to shareholders or repurchases of the Companys Common stock will fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors. The Boards decisions regarding the payment of dividends or repurchase of shares will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, covenants associated with certain of our debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations and meet its short-term and long-term obligations. The Company's material future obligations include the contractual and purchase commitments described below.\nThe Company has a contractual commitment to repay its long-term debt of $3,519.1 based on the defined terms of our debt agreements. Within the next twelve months, the company is obligated to pay $12.0 of this total debt. Our interest commitments based on the current debt balance and LIBOR rate on drawn debt at September 30, 2022 is $917.4 with $152.9 expected within the next twelve months. The company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement that fixed the variable benchmark component (LIBOR) on $700.0 of variable rate debt. Refer to Note 13 Debt for further details.\nThe Company has a long-term obligation to pay a mandatory transition tax of $16.7. No payments are required until fiscal 2024.\nAdditionally, Energizer has material future purchase commitments for goods and services which are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including price and/or quantity. Total future commitments for these obligations over the next 5 years is $21.5. Of this amount, $13.4 is due within the next twelve months. Refer to Note 18 Other Commitments and Contingencies for further details. Energizer is also party to various service and supply contracts that generally extend approximately one to three months. These arrangements are primarily individual, short-term purchase orders for routine goods and services at market prices, which are part of our normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. These contracts can generally be canceled at our option at any time. We do not believe such arrangements will adversely affect our liquidity position.\nFinally, Energizer has operating and financing leases for real estate, equipment, and other assets that include future minimum payments with initial terms of one year or more. Total future operating and finance lease payments at September 30, 2022 are $146.2 and $68.6, respectively. Within the next twelve months, operating and finance lease payments are expected to be $19.4 and $2.5, respectively. Refer to Note 11 Leases for further details.\nOther Matters\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe operations of Energizer are subject to various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations intended to protect the public health and the environment. These regulations relate primarily to worker safety, air and water quality, underground fuel storage tanks and waste handling and disposal. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, Energizer has been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) and may be required\nto share in the cost of cleanup with respect to certain federal Superfund sites. It may also be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to state-designated sites or other sites outside of the U.S.\nAccrued environmental costs at September 30, 2022 were $15.4, of which approximately $5.3 is expected to be spent during fiscal 2023. It is difficult to quantify with certainty the cost of environmental matters, particularly remediation and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment. Current environmental spending estimates could be modified as a result of changes in our plans or our understanding of underlying facts, changes in legal requirements or the enforcement or interpretation of existing requirements.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company and its affiliates are subject to a number of legal proceedings in various jurisdictions arising out of its operations. Many of these legal matters are in preliminary stages and involve complex issues of law and fact, and may proceed for protracted periods of time. The amount of liability, if any, from these proceedings cannot be determined with certainty. We are a party to legal proceedings and claims that arise during the ordinary course of business. We review our legal proceedings and claims, regulatory reviews and inspections on an ongoing basis and follow appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions. We establish accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and we disclose the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading. We do not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Based upon present information, the Company believes that its liability, if any, arising from such pending legal proceedings, asserted legal claims and known potential legal claims which are likely to be asserted, is not reasonably likely to be material to the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, taking into account established accruals for estimated liabilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments Energizer uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results the Company reports in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Specific areas, among others, requiring the application of managements estimates and judgment include assumptions pertaining to accruals for consumer and trade-promotion programs, pension benefit costs, acquisition, intangible assets and goodwill, uncertain tax positions, the reinvestment of undistributed foreign earnings and tax valuation allowances. On an ongoing basis, Energizer evaluates its estimates, but actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nThe Company's critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. A summary of Energizers significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of Energizers accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition - The Company measures revenue as the amount of consideration for which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods. Net sales reflect the transaction prices for contracts, which include units shipped at selling list prices reduced by variable consideration as determined by the terms of each individual contract. Discounts are offered to customers for early payment and an estimate of the discount is recorded as a reduction of net sales in the same period as the sale. Our standard sales terms generally include payments within 30 to 60 days and are final with returns or exchanges not permitted unless a special exception is made. Our Auto Care channel terms are longer, in some cases up to 365 days, in which case we use our Trade receivables factoring program for more timely collection. Reserves are established based on historical data and recorded in cases where the right of return does exist for a particular sale. The Company does not offer warranties on products.\nEnergizer offers a variety of programs, primarily to its retail customers, designed to promote sales of its products. Such programs require periodic payments and allowances based on estimated results of specific programs and are recorded as a reduction to net sales. Methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on specific customer pricing and promotional practices, which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to reimbursement based on actual occurrence or performance. Where applicable, future reimbursements are estimated based on a combination of historical patterns and future expectations regarding specific in-market product performance. Energizer accrues, at the time of sale, the estimated total payments and allowances associated with each transaction. Customers redeem trade promotions in the form of payments from the accrued trade allowances or invoice credits against trade receivables. Additionally, Energizer offers programs directly to consumers to promote the sale of its products. Energizer continually assesses the adequacy of accruals for customer and consumer promotional program costs not yet\npaid. To the extent total program payments differ from estimates, adjustments may be necessary. Historically, these adjustments have not been material.\nThe Companys contracts with customers do not have significant financing components or non-cash consideration and the Company does not have unbilled revenue or significant amounts of prepayments from customers. Revenue is recorded net of the taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities which are generally included in the price to the customer. Shipping and handling activities are accounted for as contract fulfillment costs and recorded in Cost of products sold.\nPension Plans - The determination of the Companys obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent on certain assumptions developed by the Company and used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Assumptions include, among others, the discount rate, future salary increases and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Actual results that differ from assumptions made, or impacts to the obligation that are due to changes to assumptions, are recognized on the balance sheet and subsequently amortized to earnings over future periods. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in macroeconomic conditions resulting in changes to assumptions may materially affect pension obligations. In determining the discount rate, the Company uses the yield on high-quality bonds in conjunction with the cash flows of its plans estimated payouts. For the U.S. plans, which were frozen January 1, 2014 and represent the Companys most significant obligations, we consider the Mercer Above-Mean yield curve in determining the discount rates.\nOf the assumptions listed above, changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used in developing plan obligations will likely have the most significant impact on the Companys annual earnings, prospectively. Based on plan assets at September 30, 2022, a 100 basis point decrease or increase in expected asset returns would increase or decrease the Companys U.S. pre-tax pension expense by $4.1. In addition, poor asset performance may increase and accelerate the rate of required pension contributions in the future. Uncertainty related to economic markets and the availability of credit may produce changes in the yields on corporate bonds rated as high-quality. As a result, discount rates based on high-quality corporate bonds may increase or decrease leading to lower or higher, respectively, pension obligations. A 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase U.S. pension obligations by $29.8 at September 30, 2022.\nAs allowed under GAAP, the Companys U.S. qualified pension plan's impact on earnings is determined using Market Related Value, which recognizes market appreciation or depreciation in the portfolio over five years and therefore reduces the short-term impact of market fluctuations.\nBusiness Combinations - The Company allocates the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The Company uses a variety of information sources to determine the value of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisers for the values and lives of property, identifiable intangibles and inventories; actuaries for defined benefit retirement plans; and legal counsel or other advisors to assess the obligations associated with legal, environmental or other claims. The excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.\nDuring fiscal 2021, Energizer used variations of the income approach in determining the fair value of the amortizable intangible assets acquired for the Formulations Acquisition. The Company utilized multi-period excess earnings methods for determining the fair value of the proprietary technology and customer relationships acquired. Our determination of the fair value of these assets involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to the revenue growth rates and discount rates. Our determination of the fair value of customer relationships also involved assumptions related to customer attrition rates.\nIntangible Assets - Significant judgment is required in assigning the respective useful lives of intangible assets. Certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment of intangible assets that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are primarily based on the same factors. The carrying value of determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over the estimated useful life. The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. The Company assesses the appropriateness of an indefinite life being assigned to certain intangible assets as a part of this annual impairment analysis. The useful life of a determinable-\nlived intangible asset would be reassessed if a triggering event was identified that indicated a potential change in the value or use of our determinable-lived assets. A change in the useful life of these assets could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nThe Company has certain trade names with indefinite lives that are reviewed for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year following the annual forecasting process, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate the trade name may be impaired. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. However, the Company can elect not to perform the qualitative assessment, and is then required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, a quantitative assessment was performed over the Armor All, STP and Rayovac trade names, resulting in non-cash impairments of $370.4, $26.3 and $127.8, respectively. For Armor All and STP, the non-cash impairments were primarily due to declines in their respective Auto Care category projections late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, significant increases in input costs, and a higher discount rate. The Rayovac non-cash impairment was primarily caused by significant sustained currency headwinds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which are expected to continue into fiscal 2023 and are included within the cash flow models, a decrease in the branded sales forecast, increases in input costs, and a higher discount rate. The quantitative estimated fair values were determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, which requires significant assumptions for each brand, including estimates related to revenue growth rates, gross margin rates, operating expenses (SG&A, R&D and A&P), and discount rates. The projections for the Armor All, STP and Rayovac fair value models are generated using the Companys three-year strategic plan, the Company's annual budget plan for fiscal 2023, and long-term category projections, to determine forecasted cash flows and operating data. Specifically, revenue growth assumptions are based on historical trends and managements expectations for future growth by brand and category. Gross margin rate assumptions are based on historical trends and management's cost cutting strategies. Operating expenses are based on historical trends and management's annual budget plan for fiscal 2023, as well as long-term operating and advertising strategies. The discount rates used in the trade name fair value estimates ranged between 9.5% and 10.0%, and are based on a weighted-average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of similar companies. The new carrying values for Armor All, STP, and Rayovac trade names are $228.5, $76.4, and $422.2, respectively.\nChanges in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets could result in additional impairment charges in future periods, which could be material. Additionally, certain factors have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, which could also result in material impairment charges. These factors include (i) failure to achieve forecasted revenue growth rates, (ii) failure to achieve cost cutting and margin improvement initiatives the Company is implementing, (iii) failure to meet forecasted operating expenses, or (iv) increases in the discount rate. Specifically, a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in an increase to the trade name impairment of approximately $48.\nSTP is within the fuel and oil additives category and due to the current expectation for an increased percentage of electric vehicles in the car parc over the long term, the Company has converted the STP trade name into a definite-life intangible asset with a 25 year useful life. This conversion will result in additional pre-tax amortization expense of approximately $3.0 in fiscal 2023.\nFinally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, a qualitative analysis was performed over the Energizer, Eveready and Varta trade names and no impairments were identified. These indefinite lived intangible assets have a combined carrying value of $111.8.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company completed the annual assessments and no impairments were identified.\nGoodwill - In fiscal 2022, the Company changed its reportable segments and correspondingly reallocated goodwill to the new reporting units: Battery & Lights North America, Battery & Lights International, Auto Care North America and Auto Care International. The Company performed an assessment of goodwill at October 1, 2021 before the change in segments, noting no impairments identified. Goodwill was reallocated to the new reporting units based on the relative fair value of each reporting unit on October 1, 2021.\nThe Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth fiscal quarter for each of these reporting units. As part of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, the Company estimated the fair value of each reporting unit under the income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow model which incorporates significant\nestimates and assumptions, including future cash flows driven by revenue and gross margin projections and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows. The Company uses the three-year strategic plan, the annual budget plan for fiscal 2023, and long-term category projections, to determine forecasted cash flows and operating data for the discounted cash flow model. Specifically, revenue growth assumptions are based on historical trends and managements expectations for future growth by category. Gross margin rate assumptions are based on historical trends and management's cost cutting strategies. The discount rates are based on a weighted-average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of similar companies.\nAs a part of the annual assessment, the Company identified a non-cash impairment of the Auto Care International reporting unit of $17.4. This non-cash impairment was primarily driven by significant sustained currency headwinds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which are expected to continue into fiscal 2023 and are included within the cash flow models, declines in the Auto Care category projections late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, and an increased discount rate. There is no remaining goodwill allocated to this reporting unit after the non-cash impairment.\nThe Battery & Lights reporting units estimated fair value exceeded their carrying values by more than 100%. The estimated fair value of the Auto Care North America reporting unit, which has a total of $134.2 of goodwill, exceeded its carrying value by 12%. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of significant judgment, estimates and assumptions. Changes in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units could result in impairment charges in future periods. Additionally, certain factors have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair values of our reporting units, which also could result in impairment charges. These factors include (i) failure to achieve forecasted revenue growth rates, (ii) failure to achieve cost cutting and margin improvement initiatives the Company is implementing, or (iii) increases in the discount rate. An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially impact our financial statements in any given year. Specifically, for the Auto Care North America reporting unit, a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in the fair value exceeding the carrying value by 5%.\nWhile the Company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized, and also on the magnitude of any such charge. The results of an impairment analysis are as of a point in time. There is no assurance that actual future earnings or cash flows of the reporting units will not decline significantly from these projections. The Company will monitor any changes to these assumptions and will evaluate goodwill as deemed warranted during future periods.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company completed the annual assessments and no impairments were identified.\nIncome Taxes - The Company's annual effective income tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe Company estimates income taxes and the effective income tax rate in each jurisdiction that it operates. This involves estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets, the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable and possible exposures related to future tax audits. Deferred tax assets are evaluated on a subsidiary by subsidiary basis to ensure that the asset will be realized. Valuation allowances are established when the realization is not deemed to be more likely than not. Future performance is monitored, and when objectively measurable operating trends change, adjustments are made to the valuation allowances accordingly. To the extent the estimates described above change, adjustments to income taxes are made in the period in which the estimate is changed.\nIn determining whether a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets are warranted, the Company assesses all available positive and negative evidence such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods and the feasibility of ongoing tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. After the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence, the conclusion was that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate enough future taxable income to realize the U.S. net deferred tax asset on its balance sheet as of September 30, 2022. The Company will continue to regularly assess the\npotential for realization of net deferred tax assets in future periods. Changes in future earnings projections, among other factors, may result in a valuation allowance against some or all of the net deferred tax assets, which may materially impact income tax expense in the period if it is determined that these factors have changed.\nThe Company operates in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax and regulatory environments, which are subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the taxing authorities. At times, we may take positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenges by the appropriate taxing authority. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities in accordance with guidance governing accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company reviews these tax uncertainties in light of the changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjusts them accordingly. The Company's policy on accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income is to treat the taxes due as a period expense when incurred.\nIn general, it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and repatriate earnings only when the tax impact is zero or very minimal. No provision has been provided for taxes that would result upon repatriation of our foreign investments to the United States. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries to fund local operations, fund strategic growth objectives, and fund capital projects. See Note 7, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The amendment simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740 and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted this standard as of October 1, 2021 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nMarket Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions\nThe market risk inherent in the Company's financial instruments positions represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in currency rates, commodity prices and interest rates. The following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. The Company's derivatives are used only for identifiable exposures, and we have not entered into hedges for trading purposes where the sole objective is to generate profits.\nCurrency Exposure\nOur business is conducted on a worldwide basis, with approximately 40% of our sales in fiscal 2022 arising from foreign countries, and a significant portion of our production capacity and cash located overseas. Consequently, we are subject to currency risks associated with doing business in foreign countries. Currency risk is heightened in areas with political or economic instability such as the Eurozone, Egypt, Russia and the Middle East and certain markets in Latin America. A significant portion of our sales are denominated in local currencies but reported in U.S. dollars, and a high percentage of product costs for such sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Therefore, although we may hedge a portion of the exposure, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to such currencies can negatively impact our reported sales and operating profits. The following discussion describes programs in place to mitigate our foreign currency exposure:\nDerivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedging Relationships\nA significant share of Energizer's product cost is more closely tied to the U.S. dollar than to the local currencies in which the product is sold. As such, a weakening of currencies relative to the U.S. dollar results in margin declines unless mitigated through pricing actions, which are not always available due to the economic or competitive environment. Conversely, strengthening of currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can improve margins. The primary currencies to which Energizer is exposed include the Euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. However, the Company also has significant exposures in many other currencies which, in the aggregate, may have a material impact on the Company's operations.\nThe Company has entered into a series of forward currency contracts to hedge the cash flow uncertainty of forecasted inventory purchases due to currency fluctuations. Energizers primary foreign affiliates, which are exposed to\nU.S. dollar purchases, have the Euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar as their local currencies. These foreign currencies represent a significant portion of Energizer's foreign currency exposure. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, Energizer had an unrealized pre-tax gain of $16.3 and $5.0, respectively, on these forward currency contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Assuming foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar remain at September 30, 2022 levels, over the next twelve months, $15.7 of the pre-tax gain included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss is expected to be included in earnings.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Cash Flow Hedging Relationships\nEnergizer's foreign subsidiaries enter into internal and external transactions that create nonfunctional currency balance sheet positions at the foreign subsidiary level. These exposures are generally the result of intercompany purchases, intercompany loans and to a lesser extent, external purchases, and are revalued in the foreign subsidiarys local currency at the end of each period. Changes in the value of the non-functional currency balance sheet positions in relation to the foreign subsidiarys local currency results in an exchange gain or loss recorded in Other items, net on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The primary currency to which Energizers foreign subsidiaries are exposed is the U.S. dollar.\nThe Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts which are not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes to hedge balance sheet exposures. Any gains or losses on these contracts would be offset by corresponding exchange gains or losses on the underlying exposures; thus they are not subject to significant market risk. The change in estimated fair value of the foreign currency contracts for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 resulted in a gain of $6.6 and was recorded in Other items, net on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income.\nCommodity Price Exposure\nThe Company uses raw materials that are subject to price volatility. The Company has in the past and may in the future use hedging instruments to reduce exposure to variability in cash flows associated with future purchases of certain materials and commodities.\nIn February 2019, the Company entered a hedging program on zinc purchases. This program was determined to\nbe a cash flow hedge and qualified for hedge accounting. The unrealized pre-tax loss on the zinc contracts was $6.1 at September 30, 2022 and the unrealized pre-tax gain recorded on zinc contracts was $4.7 at 2021. These were included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nInterest Rate Exposure\nThe Company has interest rate risk with respect to interest expense on variable rate debt. At September 30, 2022, Energizer had variable rate debt outstanding with a principal balance of $1,188.4 under the 2020 Term Loans and international borrowings. There were no outstanding borrowings on the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2022.\nIn December 2020, the Company entered into an interest rate swap (2020 interest rate swap) with an effective date of December 22, 2020, that fixed the variable benchmark component (LIBOR) at an interest rate of 0.95% on variable debt of $550.0. The notional value increased to $700.0 on January 22, 2021 and will stay at that value through December 22, 2024. The notional value will decrease by $100.0 on December 22, 2024 and by $100.0 each year thereafter until its termination date on December 22, 2027. The pre-tax gain recognized on this interest rate swap was $86.4 and $11.7 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These were included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, our weighted average interest rate on variable rate debt was 4.06%.\nArgentina Currency Exposure and Hyperinflation\nEffective July 1, 2018, the financial statements for our Argentina subsidiary were consolidated under the rules governing the translation of financial information in a highly inflationary economy. Under U.S. GAAP, an economy is considered highly inflationary if the cumulative inflation rate for a three year period meets or exceeds 100 percent. The Argentina economy exceeded the three year cumulative inflation rate of 100 percent as of June 2018. If a subsidiary is considered to be in a highly inflationary economy, the financial statements of the subsidiary must be remeasured into the Companys reporting currency (U.S. dollar) and future exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in current earnings, rather than exclusively in the equity section of the balance sheet, until such time as the economy is no longer considered highly inflationary. It is difficult to determine what continuing impact the use of highly inflationary accounting for Argentina may have on our consolidated financial statements as such impact is dependent upon movements in the applicable exchange rates between the local currency and the U.S. dollar and the amount of monetary assets and liabilities included in our affiliates' balance sheet.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nAudited Consolidated Financial Statements Page\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 238)\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income 61\nConsolidated Balance Sheets 62\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows 63\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity 64\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements 65\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Energizer Holdings, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Energizer Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, of shareholders equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRevenue Recognition - Trade Promotion Programs\nAs described in Notes 2 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company offers a variety of programs, primarily to its retail customers, designed to promote sales of its products. These programs resulted in an allowance for trade promotions of $129.5 million, which is reflected as a reduction in trade receivables, net and $57.7 million of accrued trade promotions within other current liabilities as of September 30, 2022. Such programs require periodic payments and allowances based on estimated results of specific programs and are recorded as a reduction to net sales. Methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on specific customer pricing and promotional practices, which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to reimbursement based on actual occurrence or performance. Where applicable, future reimbursements are estimated based on a combination of historical patterns and future expectations regarding specific in-market product performance. Management accrues, at the time of sale, the estimated total payments and allowances associated with each transaction. Customers redeem trade promotions in the form of payments from the accrued trade allowances or invoice credits against trade receivables.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for trade promotion programs is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the allowance for trade promotions and accrued trade promotions and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating managements significant assumptions related to historical patterns and future expectations regarding specific in-market product performance used to estimate the allowance for trade promotions and accrued trade promotions recorded by management.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the completeness, accuracy, and valuation of the estimated allowance for trade promotions and accrued trade promotions. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing managements process for developing the allowance for trade promotions and accrued trade promotions; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the estimates; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to historical patterns and future expectations regarding specific in-market product performance. Evaluating managements significant assumptions related to historical patterns and future expectations regarding specific in-market product performance involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the historical performance of similar trade programs; (ii) testing payments and invoice credits related to these trade programs; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Assessments - Armor All, STP, and Rayovac Trade Names\nAs described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys consolidated other intangible assets, net balance was $1,295.8 million as of September 30, 2022, of which the carrying values for Armor All, STP, and Rayovac trade names were $228.5 million, $76.4 million, and $422.2 million, respectively. Intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life are not amortized, but are reviewed annually for impairment of value or when indicators of a potential impairment are present. During the annual impairment assessment, management identified non-cash impairments of the Armor All, STP, and Rayovac trade names of $370.4 million, $26.3 million, and $127.8 million, respectively. The quantitative estimated fair values were determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, which requires significant assumptions for each brand, including estimates related to revenue growth rates, gross margin rates, operating expenses, and discount rates.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessments for certain trade names is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates of the Armor All, STP, and Rayovac trade names; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating managements significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, gross margin rates, operating expenses, and discount rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to\nmanagements indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of the Armor All, STP, and Rayovac trade names. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing managements process for developing the fair value estimates of the Armor All, STP, and Rayovac trade names; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the fair value methods; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue growth rates, gross margin rates, operating expenses, and discount rates. Evaluating managements significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, gross margin rates, and operating expenses involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the brands; (ii) consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method and (ii) the reasonableness of the significant assumption related to the discount rates.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment - Auto Care North America Reporting Unit\nAs described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys goodwill balance was $1,003.1 million as of September 30, 2022, of which $134.2 million relates to the Auto Care North America reporting unit. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed annually for impairment of value or when indicators of a potential impairment are present. As part of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, management estimated the fair value of each reporting unit under the income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow model which incorporates significant estimates and assumptions, including future cash flows driven by revenue and gross margin projections and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Auto Care North America reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the Auto Care North America reporting unit; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating managements significant assumptions related to revenue and gross margin projections and the discount rate; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to managements goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Auto Care North America reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing managements process for developing the fair value estimate of the reporting unit; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flows model; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the fair value model; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue and gross margin projections and the discount rate. Evaluating managements significant assumptions related to revenue and gross margin projections involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit; (ii) consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the discounted cash flows model and (ii) the reasonableness of the significant assumption related to the discount rate.\n/s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nNovember 15, 2022\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2014.\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data)\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED\nSEPTEMBER 30,\nStatement of Earnings 2022 2021 2020\nNet sales $ 3,050.1 $ 3,021.5 $ 2,744.8\nCost of products sold 1,930.6 1,860.1 1,662.9\nGross profit $ 1,119.5 $ 1,161.4 $ 1,081.9\nSelling, general and administrative expense 484.5 487.2 483.3\nAdvertising and sales promotion expense 137.1 162.1 147.1\nResearch and development expense 34.7 34.5 35.4\nAmortization of intangible assets 61.1 61.2 56.5\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets 541.9 -

Energizer Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Energizer or the Company) is a global manufacturer, marketer and distributor of household batteries, specialty batteries and portable lights under the Energizer\u00ae, Eveready\u00ae and Rayovac\u00ae brand names globally, as well as the Varta\u00ae brand name in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Energizer offers batteries using lithium, alkaline, carbon zinc, nickel metal hydride, zinc air and silver oxide constructions.\nEnergizer is also a leading designer and marketer of auto care products in the appearance, fragrance, performance, and air conditioning recharge product categories under the Armor All\u00ae, Nu Finish\u00ae, Refresh Your Car!\u00ae, LEXOL\u00ae, Eagle One\u00ae, California Scents\u00ae, Driven\u00ae, Bahama & Co\u00ae, STP\u00ae and A/C Pro\u00ae trade names and expanded our portfolio in Latin America to add the Carnu\u00ae, Grand Prix\u00ae, Kit\u00ae and Tempo\u00ae trademarks.\nOn July 1, 2015, Energizer completed its legal separation from our former parent company, Edgewell Personal Care Company (Edgewell), via a tax free spin-off (the Spin-off or Spin). Energizer operates as an independent, publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange trading under the symbol \"ENR.\"\nOn January 2, 2019, Energizer expanded its battery portfolio with the acquisitions of Spectrum Holdings, Inc.s (Spectrum) global battery, lighting, and portable power business (Battery Acquisition). The Battery Acquisition included the Rayovac and Varta brands (Acquired Battery Business).\nOn January 28, 2019, Energizer further expanded its auto care portfolio with the acquisition of Spectrum's global auto care business (Auto Care Acquisition). The Auto Care Acquisition included the Armor All, STP, and A/C PRO brands (Acquired Auto Care Business).\nOn January 2, 2020, the Company sold the Varta\u00ae consumer battery business in the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, including manufacturing and distribution facilities in Germany (Divestment Business) to VARTA Aktiengesellschaft (VARTA AG) for a contractual purchase price of \u20ac180.0, subject to purchase price adjustments (Varta Divestiture). This business was acquired as part of the Battery Acquisition and was required to be divested per regulatory requirements. Pursuant to the terms of the Battery Acquisition agreement, Spectrum also contributed cash proceeds toward this sale. Total cash proceeds received, including related hedging arrangements, net of the final working capital settlement, were $323.1 and the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $141.6. Refer to Note 5, Divestment, for further discussion.\nBasis of Presentation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Energizer and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. Energizer has no material equity method investments, variable interests or non-controlling interests.\nAs a result of the Varta Divestiture, the respective operations of the Divestment Business, including a loss recorded on divestment, have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income and Statements of Cash Flows for fiscal years 2020. There were no operations for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, and no assets or liabilities associated with this business as of September 30, 2022 or 2021. See Note 5 - Divestment for more information on the discontinued operations.\n(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nEnergizers significant accounting policies, which conform to GAAP and are applied on a consistent basis in all years presented, except as indicated, are described below.\nUse of Estimates - The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, Energizer evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer promotional programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, the carrying value of inventories, intangible and other long-lived assets, income taxes, pensions and other postretirement benefits, share-based compensation, contingencies and acquisitions. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. In regard to ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections, changes in discount rates used in discounted cash flow models or changes in other assumptions used in estimating fair values, versus those anticipated at the time of the initial acquisition, as well as subsequent estimated valuations, could result\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\nin impairment charges that may materially affect the financial statements in a given year. Refer to Note 12 Goodwill & Intangibles for additional information.\nCash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, Energizer had $205.3 and $238.9, respectively, in available cash, 73.5% and 94.8% of which was outside of the U.S., respectively. The Company has extensive operations, including a significant manufacturing footprint outside of the U.S. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to regulatory capital requirements; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations. Our intention is to reinvest these funds indefinitely.\nRestricted Cash - The Company defines restricted cash as cash that is legally restricted as to withdrawal or usage. There was no restricted cash at September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nForeign Currency Translation - Financial statements of foreign operations where the local currency is the functional currency are translated using end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the period for results of operations. Related translation adjustments are reported as a component within accumulated other comprehensive loss in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nEffective July 1, 2018, the financial statements for our Argentina subsidiary are consolidated under the rules governing the translation of financial information in a highly inflationary economy. Under U.S. GAAP, an economy is considered highly inflationary if the cumulative inflation rate for a three year period meets or exceeds 100 percent. The Argentina economy exceeded the three year cumulative inflation rate of 100 percent as of June 2018. If a subsidiary is considered to be in a highly inflationary economy, the financial statements of the subsidiary must be remeasured into the Companys reporting currency (U.S. dollar) and future exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in current earnings, rather than exclusively in the equity section of the balance sheet, until such time as the economy is no longer considered highly inflationary.\nFinancial Instruments and Derivative Securities - Energizer uses financial instruments, from time to time, in the management of foreign currency, interest rate risk and commodity price risks that are inherent to its business operations. Such instruments are not held or issued for trading purposes. Every derivative instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) is required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as either an asset or liability. Changes in fair value of recorded derivatives are required to be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.\nForeign exchange instruments, including currency forwards, are used primarily to reduce cash transaction exposures and to manage other translation exposures. Foreign exchange instruments used are selected based on their risk reduction attributes, costs and the related market conditions. The Company has designated certain foreign currency contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company has interest rate risk with respect to interest expense on variable rate debt. In December 2020, the Company terminated their previously existing interest rate swap agreements and entered into an interest rate swap (2020 interest rate swap) with an effective date on December 22, 2020, that fixed the variable benchmark component (LIBOR) at an interest rate of 0.95% on variable debt of $550.0. The notional value increased to $700.0 on January 22, 2021, and will stay at that value through December 22, 2024. The notional value will decrease by $100.0 on December 22, 2024 and by $100.0 each year thereafter until its termination date on December 22, 2027. The notional value of the swap was $700.0 at September 30, 2022.\nEnergizer uses raw materials that are subject to price volatility. The Company may use hedging instruments to reduce exposure to variability in cash flows associated with future purchases of commodities. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had derivative contracts for the future purchases of zinc.\nCash Flow Presentation - The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are prepared using the indirect method, which reconciles net (loss)/earnings to cash flow from operating activities. The reconciliation adjustments include the removal of timing differences between the occurrence of operating receipts and payments and their recognition in net (loss)/earnings. The adjustments also remove cash flows arising from investing and financing activities, which are presented separately from operating activities. Cash flows from foreign currency transactions and operations are translated at an average exchange rate for the period. Cash flows from hedging activities are included in the same category as the items being hedged, which is primarily\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\noperating activities. Cash payments related to income taxes are classified as operating activities. Cash flows are also distinguished between our continuing operations and our discontinued operations.\nTrade Receivables, net - Trade receivables are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for trade promotions reflects management's estimate of the amount of trade promotions that customers will take as an invoice reduction, rather than receiving cash payments for the trade allowances earned. See additional discussion on the trade allowances in the revenue recognition discussion further in this note. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the Company's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available information. Receivables that the Company has factored at September 30, 2022 and 2021 are excluded from the Trade receivables, net balance. Bad debt expense is included in Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income.\nTrade Receivables, net consists of:\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021\nTrade receivables $ 554.1 $ 431.8\nAllowance for trade promotions (129.5) (136.0)\nAllowance for doubtful accounts (2.9) (2.9)\nTrade receivables, net $ 421.7 $ 292.9\nTrade Receivables Factoring - Energizer enters into various factoring agreements and early pay programs with our customers to sell our trade receivables under non-recourse agreements in exchange for cash proceeds. In December 2021, the Company amended its credit agreement, and as a part of the amendment, the maximum on sold receivables was increased. The current credit agreement now allows for Energizer to sell accounts receivable up to a maximum of $600.0 annually.\nDuring fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the Company sold $578.9 and $494.8, respectively, of receivables under this program. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, Energizer had $123.3 and $149.7, respectively, of outstanding sold receivables, which are excluded from the Trade receivables, net balance above. In some instances, we may continue to service the transferred receivables after factoring has occurred. However, any servicing of the trade receivable does not constitute significant continuing involvement and we do not carry any material servicing assets or liabilities. These receivables qualify for sales treatment under ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing, and the proceeds for the sale of these receivables is included in net cash from operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, cash from factored receivables collected but not yet due to the bank included in Other current liabilities was $2.8 and $6.3, respectively. Additionally, the fees associated with factoring our receivables were $7.5, $3.5 and $4.7 during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Any discounts and factoring fees related to these receivables are expensed as incurred in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income in Selling, general and administrative expense.\nInventories - Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost generally being determined using average cost or the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The Company records a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory based upon the historical usage rates, sales patterns of its products and specifically-identified obsolete inventory.\nCapitalized Software Costs - Capitalized software costs are included in Other assets. These costs are amortized using the straight-line method over periods of related benefit ranging from three to seven years. Expenditures related to capitalized software are included in the Capital expenditures caption in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, amortization expense was $10.4, $8.3 and $8.1, respectively.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, net - Property, plant and equipment, net is stated at historical costs. Expenditures for new facilities and expenditures that substantially increase the useful life of property, including interest during construction, are capitalized and reported in the Capital expenditures caption in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and gains or losses on the disposition are reflected in earnings.\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\nProperty, plant and equipment, net held under finance leases are amortized on a straight-line bases over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset and such amortization is included in depreciation expense.\nDepreciation is generally provided on the straight-line basis by charges to pre-tax earnings at rates based on estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives range from two to twenty-five years for machinery and equipment and three to thirty years for buildings and building improvements. Depreciation expense in 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $53.1, $53.7, and $63.2, respectively, including accelerated depreciation charges of $3.0, $4.7 and $15.9 in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, primarily related to the IT integration assets and certain manufacturing assets including property, plant and equipment located at facilities that are being consolidated as part of the integration of the Battery and Auto Care Acquisitions.\nEstimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and, when appropriate, changes are made prospectively. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts.\nAcquisitions - Energizer accounts for the acquisition of a business using the acquisition method of accounting and allocates the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.\nDuring fiscal 2021, Energizer used variations of the income approach in determining the fair value of the amortizable intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition to acquire a company that specializes in developing formulations for cleaning tasks. The Company utilized multi-period excess earnings methods for determining the fair value of the proprietary technology and customer relationships acquired. Our determination of the fair value of these assets involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to the revenue growth rates and discount rates. Our determination of the fair value of customer relationships also involved assumptions related to customer attrition rates.\nEnergizer believes that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition noted above are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use. However, our assumptions are inherently risky and actual results could differ from those estimates. Adverse changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates used in future measurements of fair value, including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections, could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets that would require a non-cash charge to the consolidated statements of operations and may have a material effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets - Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are not amortized, but are evaluated annually for impairment as part of the Company's annual business planning cycle in the fourth fiscal quarter, or when indicators of a potential impairment are present. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over expected lives. Such intangibles are also evaluated for impairment including ongoing monitoring of potential impairment indicators. During the fiscal year 2022 annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter, the Company identified indefinite lived trade name impairments for Armor All, STP, and Rayovac of $370.4, $26.3, and $127.8, respectively. The Company also identified a goodwill impairment for the Auto Care International reporting unit of $17.4. Refer to Note 12 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets for additional information.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets - Energizer reviews long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the remaining useful life may warrant revision or that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset may not be fully recoverable. Energizer performs undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if impairment exists. If impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less cost of disposal.\nRevenue Recognition - The Company measures revenue as the amount of consideration for which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods. Net sales reflect the transaction prices for contracts, which include units shipped at selling list prices reduced by variable consideration as determined by the terms of each individual contract. Discounts are offered to customers for early payment and an estimate of the discount is recorded as a reduction of net sales in the same period as the sale. Our standard sales terms generally include payments within 30 to 60 days and are final with returns or exchanges not permitted unless a special exception is made. Our Auto Care channel terms are longer, in some cases up to 365 days, in which case we use our Trade Receivables factoring program for more timely collection. Reserves are established based on historical\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\ndata and recorded in cases where the right of return does exist for a particular sale. The Company does not offer warranties on products.\nEnergizer offers a variety of programs, primarily to its retail customers, designed to promote sales of its products. Such programs require periodic payments and allowances based on estimated results of specific programs and are recorded as a reduction to net sales. Methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on specific customer pricing and promotional practices, which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to reimbursement based on actual occurrence or performance. Where applicable, future reimbursements are estimated based on a combination of historical patterns and future expectations regarding specific in-market product performance. Energizer accrues, at the time of sale, the estimated total payments and allowances associated with each transaction. Customers redeem trade promotions in the form of payments from the accrued trade allowances or invoice credits against trade receivables. Additionally, Energizer offers programs directly to consumers to promote the sale of its products. Energizer continually assesses the adequacy of accruals for customer and consumer promotional program costs not yet paid. To the extent total program payments differ from estimates, adjustments may be necessary. Historically, these adjustments have not been material.\nThe Companys contracts with customers do not have significant financing components or non-cash consideration and the Company does not have unbilled revenue or significant amounts of prepayments from customers. Revenue is recorded net of the taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities which are generally included in the price to the customer. Shipping and handling activities are accounted for as contract fulfillment costs and recorded in Cost of products sold.\nAdvertising and Sales Promotion Costs - The Company advertises and promotes its products through national and regional media and expenses such activities as incurred. Advertising costs were $105.9, $122.5, and $115.1 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, 2020, respectively.\nResearch and Development Costs - The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred.\nIncome Taxes - Our annual effective income tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe Company estimates income taxes and the effective income tax rate in each jurisdiction that it operates. This involves estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets, the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable and possible exposures related to future tax audits. Deferred tax assets are evaluated on a subsidiary by subsidiary basis to ensure that the asset will be realized. Valuation allowances are established when the realization is not deemed to be more likely than not. Future performance is monitored, and when objectively measurable operating trends change, adjustments are made to the valuation allowances accordingly. To the extent the estimates described above change, adjustments to income taxes are made in the period in which the estimate is changed.\nIn determining whether a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets are warranted, the Company assesses all available positive and negative evidence such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods and the feasibility of ongoing tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. After the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence, the conclusion was that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate enough future taxable income to realize the U.S. net deferred tax asset on its balance sheet as of September 30, 2022. The Company will continue to regularly assess the potential for realization of net deferred tax assets in future periods. Changes in future earnings projections, among other factors, may result in a valuation allowance against some or all of the net deferred tax assets, which may materially impact income tax expense in the period if it is determined that these factors have changed.\nThe Company operates in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax and regulatory environments, which are subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the taxing authorities. At times, the Company may take positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenges by the appropriate taxing authority. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities in accordance with guidance governing accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company reviews these tax uncertainties in light of the changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\naudits, and adjusts them accordingly. The Company's policy on accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) is to treat the taxes due as a period expense when incurred.\nIn general, it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and repatriate earnings only when the tax impact is zero or very minimal. No provision has been provided for taxes that would result upon repatriation of our foreign investments to the United States. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries to fund local operations, fund strategic growth objectives, and fund capital projects. See Note 7, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nShare-Based Payments - The Company grants restricted stock equivalents, which generally vest over two to four years. Stock compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the full restriction period of the award, with forfeitures recognized as they occur.\nEstimated Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Certain financial instruments are required to be recorded at the estimated fair value. Changes in assumptions or estimation methods could affect the fair value estimates; however, we do not believe any such changes would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Other financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings, including notes payable, are recorded at cost, which approximates estimated fair value.\nReclassifications - Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform to the current presentation, including the recast of our segment related disclosures to align with our new reportable segments as of October 1, 2021. Refer to Note 10, Segments, for additional information.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The amendment simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740 and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted this standard as of October 1, 2021 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n(3) Revenue\nNature of Our Business - The Company, through its operating subsidiaries, is one of the worlds largest manufacturers, marketers and distributors of household batteries, specialty batteries and lighting products, and a leading designer and marketer of automotive fragrance, appearance, performance and air conditioning recharge products. We distribute our products to consumers through numerous retail locations worldwide, including mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs, food, drug and convenience stores, electronics specialty stores and department stores, hardware and automotive centers, e-commerce and military stores. We sell to our customers through a combination of a direct sales force and exclusive and non-exclusive third-party distributors and wholesalers.\nOur North America sales are generally through large retailers with nationally or regionally recognized brands. Our International sales, which includes Latin America, are comprised of modern trade, developing and distributor market groups. Modern trade, which is most prevalent in Western Europe and more developed economies throughout the world, generally refers to sales through large retailers with nationally or regionally recognized brands. Developing markets generally include sales by wholesalers or small retailers who may not have a national or regional presence. Distributors are utilized in other markets where the Company does not have a direct sales force. Each market's determination is based on the predominant customer type or sales strategy utilized in the market.\nAs discussed in Note 10, Segments, following the completion of the Battery and Auto Care Acquisition integrations in fiscal 2022, the Company has changed its reportable segments from geographical segments, previously Americas and International, to two product groupings, Batteries & Lights and Auto Care, in order to better reflect what the chief operating decision maker is reviewing to make organizational decisions and resource allocations. Therefore, the Company has recast the product and market information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 by recasting the Battery and Auto Care licensing and other sales within each product category, and Latin America within the respective Modern, Developing and Distributors markets as appropriate.\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\nSupplemental product and market information is presented below for revenues from external customers for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\nFor the Twelve Months Ended September 30,\nNet Sales 2022 2021 2020\nBatteries $ 2,298.2 $ 2,276.9 $ 2,109.1\nAuto Care 622.8 618.7 521.3\nLights 129.1 125.9 114.4\nTotal Net Sales $ 3,050.1 $ 3,021.5 $ 2,744.8\nFor the Twelve Months Ended September 30,\nNet Sales 2022 2021 2020\nNorth America $ 1,932.0 $ 1,902.1 $ 1,753.0\nModern Markets 515.9 528.8 461.8\nDeveloping Markets 400.9 393.3 342.0\nDistributor Markets 201.3 197.3 188.0\nTotal Net Sales $ 3,050.1 $ 3,021.5 $ 2,744.8\nWhen Performance Obligations are Satisfied - The Companys revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Sales predominantly contain a single delivery element, or performance obligation, and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer. This typically occurs when finished goods are delivered to the customer or when finished goods are picked up by a customer or customers carrier, depending on contract terms.\n(4) Acquisitions\nFormulations Acquisition - During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Green Global Holdings, LLC to acquire a North Carolina-based company that specializes in developing formulations for cleaning tasks (Formulations Acquisition). On December 1, 2020, the Formulations Acquisition was completed for a cash purchase price of $51.2. During fiscal 2022, the working capital settlement was finalized, reducing the purchase price by $1.0. The product formulations are both sold to customers directly and licensed to manufacturers. This acquisition is expected to bring significant innovation capabilities in formulations to the Company.\nThe acquisition is being accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. The fair value of proprietary technology acquired and customer relationships were determined by applying the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach.\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\nThe following table outlines the purchase price allocation:\nTrade receivables $ 1.3\nInventories 0.1\nOther intangible assets, net 20.5\nOperating lease assets 0.5\nAccounts payable (0.2)\nCurrent operating lease liabilities (0.2)\nOther current liabilities (0.2)\nOperating lease liabilities (0.3)\nTotal identifiable net assets $ 21.5\nGoodwill 28.7\nNet assets acquired $ 50.2\nThe table below identifies the purchased intangible assets of $20.5:\nTotal Weighted Average Useful Lives\nProprietary formulas $ 19.5 7\nCustomer relationships 1.0 15\nTotal Other intangible assets, net $ 20.5\nThe Company finalized their purchase price accounting in fiscal 2022. The goodwill acquired in this acquisition is attributable to the value the Company expects to achieve from the significant innovation capabilities in formulations that the acquired company will bring to our organization, as well as the workforce acquired. The goodwill was allocated to the Americas segment prior to the Company's reorganization of our reportable segments on October 1, 2021. Refer to Note 12, Goodwill and intangible assets, for additional details. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.\nIn conjunction with the acquisition, the Company entered into incentive compensation agreements with certain key personnel. These agreements allow for potential earn out payments of up to $35.0 based on the achievement of a combination of financial and product development and commercialization performance targets and continued employment with the Company over three performance years. These agreements are not considered a component of the acquisition purchase price but rather as employee compensation arrangements. The Company recognized expense of $1.1 and $3.4 in the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This was recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income in Selling, general and administrative expense and was paid out during fiscal 2022. No amounts have been recognized for the\nsecond or third performance years under the agreement at September 30, 2022.\nFDK Indonesia Acquisition - During fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with FDK Corporation to acquire its subsidiary PT FDK Indonesia, a battery manufacturing facility (FDK Indonesia Acquisition). On October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition for a contractual purchase price of $18.2. After contractual and working capital adjustments, the Company paid cash of $16.9 and had a working capital adjustment of $0.7 in fiscal 2021. The acquisition of the FDK Indonesia facility increased the Company's alkaline battery production capacity and allows for the avoidance of future planned capital expenditures.\nThe Company finalized their purchase price accounting in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2021. The FDK Indonesia Acquisition is being accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the Property, plant and equipment were estimated using the cost approach. After determining the fair value of the real property acquired, which was greater than the purchase price, the acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain of $0.6, which was recorded in Other items, net on the Companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings. No goodwill or intangibles were identified with the purchase.\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\nThe following table outlines the purchase price allocation as of the date of acquisition:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1.7\nTrade receivables 4.3\nInventories 7.8\nOther current assets 1.1\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 19.4\nOther assets 2.8\nAccounts payable (10.7)\nOther current liabilities (0.5)\nDeferred tax liabilities (0.8)\nOther liabilities (6.9)\nNet assets acquired $ 18.2\nCustom Accessories Europe Acquisition - On January 31, 2020, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement to acquire Custom Accessories Europe Group International Limited (CAE) for $1.9 in cash. CAE is a well-established marketer of branded automotive accessories throughout the United Kingdom and Europe. CAE partners with major automotive accessory brand owners to identify and develop complimentary brand extensions supported by sourcing and distribution activities. The purchase agreement had earn out payments that could increase the purchase price up to $9.9 if certain financial metrics are achieved over the next three years. During fiscal 2021, CAE achieved the full earn out threshold under the share purchase agreement, resulting in the full consideration of $9.9 to be paid out, including contingent consideration payments of $6.8 during the year. The Company has allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, resulting in identified intangible assets for vendor relationships of approximately $8.0, which will be amortized over the three-year lives of the vendor agreements.\nPro Forma Financial Information- Pro forma results for the Formulations Acquisition, FDK Indonesia Acquisition and CAE acquisition were not considered material and, as such, are not included.\nAcquisition and Integration Costs- Acquisition and integration costs incurred during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 relate to the FDK Indonesia Acquisition, Formulations Acquisition, the Battery Acquisition and the Auto Care Acquisition. Pre-tax costs incurred were $16.5, $68.9 and $68.0 in the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nPre-tax costs recorded in Costs of products sold were $6.0, $33.7, and $32.0 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, which primarily related to facility exit and integration restructuring costs of $5.2, $31.9 and $29.3 as discussed in Note 6, Restructuring.\nPre-tax acquisition and integration costs recorded in SG&A were $9.4, $40.0 and $38.8 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In fiscal 2022 the SG&A expenses primarily related to the integration of acquired information technology systems, consulting costs, and retention-related compensation costs. In fiscal 2021 and 2020 these expenses primarily related to consulting fees for the 2020 restructuring program, success incentives, and costs of integrating the information technology systems of the Battery and Auto Care Acquisition businesses.\nFor the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 the Company recorded $1.1, $1.1 and $1.3 in Research and development, respectively.\nIncluded in Other items, net was pre-tax income of $5.9 and $4.1 in the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The pre-tax income recorded in fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by the gain on a sale of assets of $3.3, which was part of the integration restructuring discussed in Note 6.\nThe pre-tax income recorded in fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by pre-acquisition insurance proceeds of $4.9, a $1.0 gain on the sale of assets and $0.9 of transition services income, offset by a $2.2 loss related to the hedge contract on the proceeds from the Varta Divestiture and $0.5 of other items.\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\n(5) Divestment\nAs discussed in Note 1, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation, the Divestment Business was classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income as of September 30, 2020. There were no operations for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, or assets or liabilities held for sale as of September 30, 2022 or 2021.\nOn May 29, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with VARTA AG to sell the Divestment Business for \u20ac180.0, subject to approval by the European Commission and certain purchase price adjustments. On January 2, 2020, the Company sold the business to VARTA AG. Total cash proceeds, including related hedging arrangements, net of the final working capital settlement, were $323.1 from Varta AG and Spectrum. Spectrum contributed proceeds pursuant to the terms of the Battery Acquisition agreement.\nFor the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, the Company has recorded a pre-tax loss of $141.6 for the divestment, which includes contractual adjustments and recognition of tax and other indemnifications under the definitive purchase agreement. Under the definitive purchase agreement, the Company indemnified VARTA AG for certain tax liabilities that existed as of the divestment date. As previously disclosed, Spectrum has further indemnified the Company for those liabilities that arose from the tax years prior to the Company's acquisition of the Divestment Business. An indemnification asset and liability, where necessary, has been recorded to reflect these arrangements.\nThe following table summarizes the components of Loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020:\nFor the Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2020\nNet sales $ 115.8\nCost of products sold 88.2\nGross profit 27.6\nSelling, general and administrative expense 18.0\nAdvertising and sales promotion expense 0.3\nResearch and development expense 0.8\nInterest expense 12.1\nLoss on sale of business 141.6\nOther items, net (3.9)\nLoss before income taxes from discontinued operations (141.3)\nIncome tax benefit (1.2)\nNet loss from discontinued operations $ (140.1)\nIncluded in the Net loss from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, are the deferred financing fee write off related to the pre-payment of debt from the divestment proceeds of $6.9, divestment related pre-tax costs of $1.7 and allocated pre-tax interest expense of $5.0.\n(6) Restructuring\nIn the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019, the Company began implementing restructuring related integration plans for our manufacturing and distribution networks. These plans include the closure and combination of distribution and manufacturing facilities in order to reduce complexity and realize greater efficiencies in our manufacturing, packaging and distribution processes. All activities within this plan were substantially complete by December 31, 2021 and the Company does not expect to incur additional material charges associated with these plans.\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\nPart of this plan was the exit of our Dixon, IL leased packaging facility, which the Company vacated during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company entered into a termination agreement with the landlord. The Company terminated the lease agreement, which went into 2028, reducing the finance lease obligations by $9.8. The termination agreement required the Company to pay a termination fee of $4.0, as well as decommissioning costs and brokerage fees. Since the Company has already vacated the facility as a part of the 2019 restructuring program, most assets associated with the location have already been fully depreciated. The termination of this lease resulted in a gain of $4.5 recognized in Other items, net during fiscal 2022.\nIn the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020, the Company initiated a new restructuring program with a primary focus on reorganizing its global end-to-end supply chain network and ensuring accountability by category. This program includes streamlining the Companys end-to-end supply chain model to enable rapid response to category specific demands and enhancing our ability to better serve our customers. Planning and execution of this program began in fiscal year 2021 and this program was substantially complete by December 31, 2021 and the Company does not expect to incur additional material charges associated with these plans.\nThe pre-tax expense for charges related to the restructuring plans for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are noted in the table below and were reflected in Cost of products sold, Selling, general and administrative expense, Research and development, and Other items, net on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income:\nFor the Years Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\n2019 Restructuring Program\nCosts of products sold\nSeverance and related benefit costs $ (0.1) $ 0.1 $ 0.8\nAccelerated depreciation and asset write-offs 1.2 6.7 12.0\nOther exit costs(1)\n2.8 16.5 16.3\nOther items, net\nGain on termination of finance lease(2)\n$ (4.5) - -\nGain on sale of fixed assets(3)\n$ - (3.3) -\nTotal 2019 Restructuring costs $ (0.6) $ 20.0 $ 29.1\n2020 Restructuring Program\nCosts of products sold\nSeverance and related benefit costs $ 0.2 $ 0.5 $ -\nOther restructuring related costs(4)\n1.1 8.1 0.2\nSelling, general and administrate expense\nSeverance and related benefit costs 0.1 0.5 0.4\nOther restructuring related costs(4)\n- 7.5 0.6\nResearch and development expense\nSeverance and related benefit costs - 0.2 -\nTotal 2020 Restructuring Costs $ 1.4 $ 16.8 $ 1.2\nProject Momentum Restructuring\nSelling, general and administrate expense\nOther restructuring related costs(4)\n$ 0.9 $ - $ -\nTotal Momentum Restructuring Costs $ 0.9 $ - $ -\nTotal restructuring related expense $ 1.7 $ 36.8 $ 30.3\n(1) Includes charges primarily related to environmental investigatory and mitigation costs, consulting, relocation and other facility exit costs.\n(2) The gain relates to the exit of our Dixon, IL leased packaging facility, which was a finance leased location. The Company vacated the facility and entered into a termination agreement with the landlord during fiscal year 2022.\n(3) Relates to the sale of the Guatemala battery manufacturing facility in September 2021 net of closing costs, legal fees, and fixed asset write-offs. Net cash proceeds were $5.5.\n(4) Primarily includes consulting fees for the restructuring program.\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\nAlthough the Company's restructuring costs are recorded outside of segment profit, if allocated to our new reportable segments, the restructuring costs noted above for fiscal 2022 would have been included in our Batteries & Lights and Auto Care segments in the amount of $1.3 and $0.4, respectively. The restructuring costs noted above for fiscal year 2021 would have been included in our Batteries & lights and Auto Care segments in the amount of $30.7 and $6.1, respectively. The restructuring costs noted above for fiscal year 2020 would have been incurred within our Batteries & Lights and Auto Care segments in the amount of $21.7 and $8.6, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to the 2019 restructuring program for the twelve Months Ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020:\nUtilized\nSeptember 30, 2019 Charge to Income Cash Non-Cash September 30, 2020\nSeverance & termination related costs $ 9.8 $ 0.8 $ 5.3 $ - $ 5.3\nAccelerated depreciation & asset write-offs - 12.0 - 12.0 -\nOther exit costs - 16.3 13.4 - 2.9\nTotal $ 9.8 $ 29.1 $ 18.7 $ 12.0 $ 8.2\nSeptember 30, 2020 Charge to Income Cash Non-Cash September 30, 2021 (1)\nSeverance & termination related costs $ 5.3 $ 0.1 $ 4.0 $ - $ 1.4\nAccelerated depreciation & asset write-offs - 6.7 - 6.7 -\nGain on sale of fixed assets - (3.3) (5.5) 1.7 0.5\nOther exit costs 2.9 16.5 17.2 - 2.2\nTotal $ 8.2 $ 20.0 $ 15.7 $ 8.4 $ 4.1\nSeptember 30, 2021 Charge to Income Cash Non-Cash September 30, 2022 (1)\nSeverance & termination related costs $ 1.4 $ (0.1) $ 1.2 $ - $ 0.1\nAccelerated depreciation & asset write-offs - 1.2 - 1.2 -\nGain on sale of fixed assets 0.5 - 0.5 - -\nGain on termination of finance lease - (4.5) 5.1 (9.6) -\nOther exit costs 2.2 2.8 5.0 - -\nTotal $ 4.1 $ (0.6) $ 11.8 $ (8.4) $ 0.1\n(1) At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the restructuring reserve is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Other current liabilities.\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to the 2020 restructuring program for the Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020:\nUtilized\nSeptember 30, 2019 Charge to Income Cash Non-Cash September 30, 2020\nSeverance & termination related costs $ - $ 0.4 $ - $ - $ 0.4\nOther restructuring related costs - 0.8 - - 0.8\nTotal $ - $ 1.2 $ - $ - $ 1.2\nSeptember 30, 2020 Charge to Income Cash Non-Cash September 30, 2021 (1)\nSeverance & termination related costs $ 0.4 $ 1.2 $ 0.7 $ - $ 0.9\nOther restructuring related costs 0.8 15.6 15.7 - $ 0.7\nTotal $ 1.2 $ 16.8 $ 16.4 $ - $ 1.6\nSeptember 30, 2021 Charge to Income Cash Non-Cash September 30, 2022 (1)\nSeverance & termination related costs $ 0.9 $ 0.3 $ 0.5 $ - $ 0.7\nOther restructuring related costs $ 0.7 $ 1.1 $ 1.8 $ - -\nTotal $ 1.6 $ 1.4 $ 2.3 $ - $ 0.7\n(1) At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the restructuring reserve is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Other current liabilities.\nSubsequent to the fiscal year-end, the Board of Directors approved a profit recovery program, Project Momentum, which includes an enterprise-wide restructuring focused on recovering operating margins, optimizing our manufacturing, distribution, and global supply chain networks, and enhancing our organizational efficiency across both segments. During the fourth quarter, the Company accrued $0.9 of consulting costs related to the design of the program.\n(7) Income Taxes\nThe (benefit)/provisions for income taxes consisted of the following:\nFor the Years Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nCurrent:\nUnited States - Federal $ (1.9) $ 4.7 $ 13.5\nState 3.5 1.6 3.0\nForeign 59.7 49.9 39.2\nTotal current $ 61.3 $ 56.2 $ 55.7\nDeferred:\nUnited States - Federal (113.1) (57.8) (29.4)\nState (14.2) (3.8) (3.1)\nForeign (8.0) (1.3) (2.3)\nTotal deferred $ (135.3) $ (62.9) $ (34.8)\n(Benefit)/provision for income taxes $ (74.0) $ (6.7) $ 20.9\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\nThe source of pre-tax (loss)/earnings was:\nFor the Years Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nUnited States $ (554.5) $ (90.1) $ (114.1)\nForeign 249.0 244.3 181.8\nPre-tax (loss)/earnings $ (305.5) $ 154.2 $ 67.7\nA reconciliation of income tax (benefit)/provision with the amounts computed at the statutory federal income tax rate follows:\nFor the Years Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nComputed tax at federal statutory rate $ (64.2) 21.0 % $ 32.4 21.0 % $ 14.2 21.0 %\nState income taxes, net of federal tax benefit (9.7) 3.2 0.2 0.1 (0.7) (1.0)\nForeign rate differential 4.4 (1.4) 0.8 0.5 2.0 3.0\nOther taxes including repatriation of foreign earnings and GILTI 2.4 (0.8) 5.5 3.6 4.4 6.5\nForeign tax incentives (2.8) 0.9 (3.7) (2.4) (3.6) (5.3)\nUncertain tax positions (10.1) 3.3 0.2 0.1 2.1 3.1\nNondeductible transaction expenses - - - - 1.0 1.5\nDebt refinancing - - (3.4) (2.2) - -\nTax structuring - - (39.5) (25.6) - -\nOther, net 6.0 (2.0) 0.8 0.6 1.5 2.1\nTotal $ (74.0) 24.2 % $ (6.7) (4.3) % $ 20.9 30.9 %\nThe Company has been granted two foreign tax incentives providing for a reduced tax rate on profits related to certain battery productions.

In addition, there are $10.6 of tax loss carryforwards and credits with no expiration at September 30, 2022. The valuation allowance is primarily attributed to tax loss carryforwards and tax credits outside the U.S.\nIn general, it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and repatriate earnings only when the tax impact is zero or very minimal. No provision has been provided for taxes that would result upon repatriation of our foreign investments to the United States. At September 30, 2022, approximately $1,099 of basis differential in our investment in foreign affiliates was considered indefinitely invested in those businesses. We estimate that the U.S. federal income tax liability that could potentially arise if indefinitely invested basis of foreign subsidiaries were repatriated in full to the U.S. would be significant. While it is not practicable to calculate a specific potential U.S. tax exposure due to changing statutory rates in foreign jurisdictions over time, as well as other factors, we estimate the potential U.S. tax may be in excess of $231, if all unrealized basis differences were repatriated assuming foreign cash was available to do so.\nThe unrecognized tax benefits activity is summarized below:\nFor the Years Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nUnrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year $ 13.5 $ 14.2 $ 12.8\nAdditions based on current year tax positions and acquisitions - 0.1 0.1\nAdditions based on prior year tax positions and acquisitions - 2.6 2.8\nReductions for prior year tax positions - - (0.6)\nSettlements with taxing authorities/statute expirations (4.3) (3.4) (0.9)\nUnrecognized tax benefits, end of year $ 9.2 $ 13.5 $ 14.2\nIncluded in the unrecognized tax benefits noted above are $9.2 of uncertain tax positions that would affect Energizers effective tax rate, if recognized. Energizer does not expect any significant increases or decreases to their unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months of this reporting date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, unrecognized tax benefits are classified as Other liabilities (non-current) to the extent that payments are not anticipated within one year.\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\nEnergizer classifies accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. The accrued interest and penalties are not included in the table above. Energizer has accrued $3.0 of interest (net of the deferred tax asset of $0.1) and penalties of $1.2 at September 30, 2022, $6.8 of interest (net of the deferred tax asset of $1.1) and penalties of $3.4 at September 30, 2021, and $4.9 of interest (net of the deferred tax asset of $0.7) and penalties of $3.9 at September 30, 2020. Interest was computed on the difference between the tax position recognized in accordance with GAAP and the amount expected to be taken in the Company's tax return.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various cities and states, and more than 50 foreign jurisdictions where Energizer has operations. U.S. federal, state and local income tax returns for tax years ended September 30, 2018 and after remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. There are open examinations in the U.S. and at some of the foreign entities and the status of income tax examinations varies by jurisdiction. At this time, Energizer does not anticipate any material adjustments to its financial statements resulting from tax examinations currently in progress.\nThe Company is contractually indemnified by Spectrum for any tax liability of the Acquired Battery and Auto Care Businesses arising from tax years prior to the acquisitions. The Company is also contractually obligated to pay Spectrum any tax benefit it receives in a tax year after the acquisitions as a result of an indemnification payment made by Spectrum. An indemnification asset and liability, where necessary, has been recorded to reflect this arrangement. The Company has also indemnified VARTA AG for certain tax liabilities that existed as of the divestment date. An indemnification asset or liability, where necessary, has been recorded to reflect these arrangements.\n(8) Share-Based Payments\nThe Board of Directors adopted the Energizer Holdings, Inc. Equity Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan) on July 1, 2015, upon completion of the Spin-off. Under the terms of the Plan, stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock equivalents, stock appreciation rights and performance-based stock awards may be granted to directors, officers and employees of the Company. The Plan authorizes a maximum number of 10 million common shares to be awarded.\nOn January 27, 2020, the Company's shareholders approved the Energizer Holdings, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (Omnibus Plan). The Omnibus Plan replaces and supersedes the 2015 Plan. No new awards will be issued under the 2015 Plan, though the terms of the 2015 Plan will continue to govern all awards granted under that plan.\nThe Omnibus Plan authorized 6.5 million shares to be awarded, as well as the 0.3 million shares that were still available for grant under the 2015 Plan. Under the Omnibus Plan, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units (time-based or performance-based), other stock awards and cash-based awards may be granted to directors, officers and employees of the Company. For purposes of determining the number of shares available for future issuance under the Omnibus Plan, awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights, will reduce the shares available for future issuance by two for every one share awarded. Stock options and stock appreciation rights reduce the shares available for future issuance on a one-for-one basis. At September 30, 2022, there were 4.3 million shares available for future awards under the Plan.\nTotal compensation cost charged against income for Energizers share-based compensation arrangements was $13.2, $10.2 and $24.5 for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and was recorded in SG&A expense. The total income tax benefit recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income for share-based compensation arrangements was $2.1, $2.3 and $4.7 for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Equivalents (RSE)\nIn November 2018, the Company granted RSE awards to a group of key employees which included approximately 73,000 shares that vest ratably over four years. The closing stock price on the date of the grant used to determine the award fair value was $60.25.\nIn November 2019, the Company granted RSE awards to a group of key employees of approximately 134,000 shares that vest ratably over four years and granted RSE awards to a group of key executives of approximately 81,000 shares that vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant. In addition, the Company granted approximately 306,000 performance shares to a group of key employees and key executives that will vest subject to meeting target amounts for both cumulative adjusted earnings per share and cumulative free cash flow as a percentage of sales over the three year performance period. These performance\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\nmeasures are equally weighted in determining the final share award with the maximum award payout of approximately 612,000 shares. The closing stock price on the date of the grant used to determine the award fair value was $43.10. Subsequent to year-end, the performance shares issued in November 2019 were all cancelled as the three year performance metrics were not achieved.\nIn November 2020, the Company granted RSE awards to a group of key employees of approximately 120,000 shares that vest ratably over four years and granted RSE awards to a group of key executives of approximately 71,000 shares that vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant. In addition, the Company granted approximately 272,000 performance shares to a group of key employees and key executives that will vest subject to meeting target amounts for both cumulative adjusted earnings per share and cumulative free cash flow as a percentage of sales over the three year performance period. These performance measures are equally weighted in determining the final share award with the maximum award payout of approximately 544,000 shares. The closing stock price on the date of the grant used to determine the award fair value was $42.98.\nIn November 2021, the Company granted RSE awards to a group of key employees of approximately 140,000 shares that vest ratably over four years and granted RSE awards to a group of key executives of approximately 113,000 shares that vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant. In addition, the Company granted approximately 393,000 performance shares to a group of key employees and key executives that will vest subject to two performance requirements. Half of the awards will vest based on meeting target amounts for cumulative adjusted earnings per share and the other half will vest based on total shareholder return (\"TSR\") metrics compared to the Company's performance peer group over the three year performance period. These performance measures are equally weighted with the maximum award payout of approximately 786,000 shares. The closing stock price on the date of the grant used to determine the award fair value for the cumulative adjusted earnings per share portion of the award was $38.75.\nThe portion of the November 2021 performance awards that are contingent upon achievement of the TSR have a 45.7% fair value premium added to the closing stock price on the date of the grant based on a simulation of outcomes under a Monte Carlo valuation model. The assumptions for the valuation of TSR performance shares granted during the year ended September 30, 2022 are summarized in the table below:\nFiscal Year 2022\nExpected term (in years) 3.0\nExpected volatility 42.3 %\nExpected dividend rate 3.1 %\nExpected risk-free rate 0.8 %\nFair value of TSR award at grant $56.45\nThe expected volatility rate for Energizer and the peer companies was based on historical stock price movements. The risk free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturities yield on the grant date for the remaining length of the performance period.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's RSE activity (including performance awards at stretch) during the current fiscal year (shares in millions):\nShares Weighted-Average\nGrant Date Estimated Fair Value per Share\nNonvested RSE at October 1, 2021 2.0 $ 46.44\nGranted 1.2 $ 44.31\nVested (0.3) $ 51.26\nCancelled (0.4) $ 54.99\nNonvested RSE at September 30, 2022 2.5 $ 43.64\nAs of September 30, 2022, there was an estimated $27.7 of total unrecognized compensation costs related to the outstanding RSE awards, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.2 years. The weighted average estimated fair value\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\nfor RSE awards granted was $52.5, $37.1, and $36.8 for September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The estimated fair value of RSE awards that vested was $12.1, $21.7, and $34.0 in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nSubsequent to year-end, in November 2022, the Company granted RSE awards to a group of key employees of approximately 391,000 shares that vest ratably over four years and granted RSE awards to a group of key executives of approximately 147,000 shares that vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant. In addition, the Company granted approximately 344,000 performance shares to a group of key executives that will vest subject to meeting certain performance metrics over the three year performance period. The maximum award payout of approximately 688,000 shares. The closing stock price on the date of the grant used to determine the award fair value was $29.23.\n(9) Earnings per share\nBasic (loss)/earnings per share is based on the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is based on the average number of shares used for the basic (loss)/earnings per share calculation, adjusted for the dilutive effect of restricted stock equivalents, performance shares, deferred compensation equity plan and Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (MCPS).\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, the MCPS were converted to approximately 4.7 million shares of Common stock. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, the issued common shares are included in the basic weighted average common shares outstanding for the period subsequent to the conversion, and included in the diluted calculation prior to their conversion using the if-converted method and are only included if the conversion would be further dilutive to the calculation. The Company's MCPS were considered anti-dilutive for all periods and excluded for the calculations of diluted (loss)/earnings.\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted (loss)/earnings per share for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\nFor the Years Ended September 30,\n(in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 2020\nBasic earnings (loss) / earnings per share\nNet (loss) / earnings from continuing operations $ (231.5) $ 160.9 $ 46.8\nMandatory preferred stock dividends (4.0) (16.2) (16.2)\nNet (loss) / earnings from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders (235.5) 144.7 30.6\nNet loss from discontinued operations, net of tax - - (140.1)\nNet (loss) / earnings attributable to common shareholders $ (235.5) $ 144.7 $ (109.5)\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic 69.9 68.2 68.8\nBasic net (loss) / earnings per common share from continuing operations $ (3.37) $ 2.12 $ 0.44\nBasic net loss per common share from discontinued operations - - (2.03)\nBasic net (loss) / earnings per common share $ (3.37) $ 2.12 $ (1.59)\nDiluted (loss) / earnings per share\nNet (loss) / earnings attributable to common shareholders $ (235.5) $ 144.7 $ (109.5)\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic 69.9 68.2 68.8\nEffect of dilutive restricted stock equivalents - 0.2 0.2\nEffect of dilutive performance shares - 0.2 0.4\nEffect of stock based deferred compensation plan - 0.1 0.1\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted 69.9 68.7 69.5\nDiluted (loss) / earnings per common share from continuing operations $ (3.37) $ 2.11 $ 0.44\nDiluted loss per common share from discontinued operations - - (2.02)\nDiluted net (loss) / earnings per common share $ (3.37) $ 2.11 $ (1.58)\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company was in a net loss position and all of the 0.8 million of outstanding RSE, 1.7 million of performance shares and 0.1 million deferred compensation awards were excluded from the diluted weighted average shares outstanding calculation as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, there were 0.1 million and 0.2 million restricted stock equivalents that were anti-dilutive and not included in the diluted net earnings per share calculations, respectively. Performance based restricted stock equivalents of 1.3 million and 1.1 million were excluded for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as the performance targets for those shares had not been achieved as of the end of the current period.\n(10) Segments\nAs of October 1, 2021, the Company changed its reportable operating segments from two geographical segments, previously Americas and International, to two product groupings, Battery & Lights and Auto Care. This change came with the completion of the Battery and Auto Care Acquisition integrations in fiscal 2022. The Company changed its reporting structure to better reflect what the chief operating decision maker is reviewing to make organizational decisions and resource allocations. The Company has recast the information for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 to align with this presentation.\nSegment performance is evaluated based on segment operating profit, exclusive of general corporate expenses (including share-based compensation costs), amortization of intangibles, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, acquisition and\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\nintegration activities, including restructuring charges, acquisition earn out, the costs of the flooding of our manufacturing facility in Brazil, the costs of exiting the Russian market, and other items determined to be corporate in nature. Financial items, such as interest income and expense, gain on finance lease termination and loss on extinguishment of debt are managed on a global basis at the corporate level. The exclusion of acquisition and integration costs from segment results reflects managements view on how it evaluates segment performance. The Company also excludes amortization of intangibles and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets from segments as these are non-cash items related to the original purchase of the intangibles and not utilized to evaluate current segment performance.\nEnergizers operating model includes a combination of standalone and shared business functions between the product segments, varying by country and region of the world. Shared functions include the sales and marketing functions, as well as human resources, IT and finance shared service costs. Energizer applies a fully allocated cost basis, in which shared business functions are allocated between segments. Such allocations are estimates, and do not represent the costs of such services if performed on a standalone basis.\nSegment sales and profitability for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are presented below:\nFor the Years Ended September 30,\nNet Sales 2022 2021 2020\nBatteries & Lights $ 2,427.3 $ 2,402.8 $ 2,223.5\nAuto Care 622.8 618.7 521.3\nTotal net sales $ 3,050.1 $ 3,021.5 $ 2,744.8\nSegment Profit\nBatteries & Lights 553.6 553.6 512.6\nAuto Care 46.5 98.2 79.4\nTotal segment profit $ 600.1 $ 651.8 $ 592.0\nGeneral corporate and other expenses (1) (101.6) (96.0) (103.8)\nAmortization of intangible assets (61.1) (61.2) (56.5)\nImpairment of goodwill & intangible assets (541.9) - -\nAcquisition and integration costs (2) (16.5) (68.9) (68.0)\nAcquisition earn out (3) (1.1) (3.4) -\nLoss on extinguishment of debt - (103.3) (94.9)\nInterest expense (158.4) (161.8) (195.0)\nProject Momentum Restructuring costs (1) (0.9) - -\nExit of Russian market (4) (14.6) - -\nGain on finance lease termination (5) 4.5 - -\nBrazil flood damage, net of insurance proceeds (6) (9.7) - -\nOther items, net (7) (4.3) (3.0) (6.1)\nTotal (loss)/earnings before income taxes $ (305.5) $ 154.2 $ 67.7\n(1) Recorded in SG&A on the Consolidated (Condensed) Statement of Earnings.\n(2) Acquisition and integration costs were included in the following lines in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income:\nFor the Years Ended September 30,\nAcquisition and Integration Costs 2022 2021 2020\nCost of products sold $ 6.0 $ 33.7 $ 32.0\nSG&A 9.4 40.0 38.8\nResearch and development 1.1 1.1 1.3\nOther items, net - (5.9) (4.1)\nTotal Acquisition and Integration Costs $ 16.5 $ 68.9 $ 68.0\n(3) This represents the estimated earn out achieved through September 30, 2022 and 2021 under the incentive agreements entered into with the Formulations Acquisition and is recorded in SG&A on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\n(4) These are the costs associated with the Company's exit of the Russian market during fiscal 2022.

Energizer's portfolio of leases contains certain real estate, equipment, vehicles and office equipment leases. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Additionally, the Company's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company does not account for lease components separately from non-lease components. The discount rate used to calculate present value for both operating and financing leases is Energizer's incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date, or if available, the rate implicit in the lease. The incremental borrowing rate used is determined based on fully secured borrowings at the time of lease commencement. Many of these agreements contain options to renew or terminate the lease. For calculating lease liabilities, the Company includes these options within the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will execute such options. Some of the leases include variable payments, which primarily are tied to asset usage or sales rather than an index or rate. As such, these variable payments are not included in the calculation of the Company's lease assets and liabilities.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021 the amounts for leases included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet include:\nBalance Sheet Location September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nOperating Leases:\nOperating lease asset $ 100.1 $ 112.3\nOperating lease liabilities - current 15.8 15.5\nOperating lease liabilities 88.2 102.3\nTotal Operating Lease Liabilities $ 104.0 $ 117.8\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years) 15.2 16.3\nWeighted-average discount rate 4.0 % 4.1 %\nFinance Leases:\nProperty, plant and equipment, net $ 32.6 $ 37.2\nCurrent portion of finance leases 0.4 2.3\nLong-term debt 31.9 42.0\nTotal Finance Lease Liabilities $ 32.3 $ 44.3\nWeighted Average remaining lease term (in years) 23.5 19.8\nWeighted-average discount rate 6.7 % 6.7 %\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\nIn April 2022, the Company entered into a termination agreement with the landlord of our finance lease in Dixon, IL. The Company terminated the lease agreement, which went into 2028, reducing our finance lease obligations by $9.8. The termination agreement required the Company to pay a termination fee of $4.0, as well as decommissioning costs and brokerage fees. Since the Company has already vacated the facility as a part of the 2019 restructuring program, most assets associated with the location have already been fully depreciated.

As part of our business planning cycle, we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing for our reporting units in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. During our annual impairment assessment we identified a non-cash impairment within the Auto Care International reporting unit of $17.4. This non-cash impairment was primarily driven by significant sustained currency headwinds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which are expected to continue into fiscal 2023 and are included within the cash flow models, declines in the Auto Care category projections late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, and an increased discount rate. There is no remaining goodwill allocated to this reporting unit after the non-cash impairment. This fair value measurement fell within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, see Note Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management.\nThe Battery & Lights reporting units estimated fair value exceeded their carrying values by more than 100%.The estimated fair value of the Auto Care North America reporting unit, which has a total of $134.2 of goodwill, exceeded its carrying value by 12%. As part of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, the Company estimated the fair value of each reporting unit under the income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow model which incorporates significant estimates and assumptions, including future cash flows driven by revenue and gross margin projections and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows. The Company uses the three-year strategic plan, the annual budget plan for fiscal 2023, and long-term category projections, to determine forecasted cash flows and operating data for the discounted cash flow model. Specifically, revenue growth assumptions are based on historical trends and managements expectations for future growth by category. Gross margin rate assumptions are based on historical trends and management's cost cutting strategies. The discount rates are based on a weighted-average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of similar companies.\nChanges in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the Company's goodwill reporting units could result in impairment charges in future periods, which could be material. Additionally, certain factors have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, which also could result in material impairment charges. These factors include (i) failure to achieve forecasted revenue growth rates, (ii) failure to achieve cost cutting and margin improvement initiatives the Company is implementing, or (iii) increases in the discount rate.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company completed the annual assessments and no impairments were identified.\nIndefinite-lived Intangible Asset Annual Impairment Analysis\nWe completed impairment testing on indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill, which are trademarks/brand names used in our various battery, auto care and lighting product categories. During our annual impairment assessment we identified non-cash impairments of the Armor All, STP, and Rayovac trade names of $370.4, $26.3, and $127.8, respectively. For Armor All and STP, the non-cash impairments were primarily due to declines in their respective Auto Care category projections late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, significant increases in input costs, and a higher discount rate. The Rayovac non-cash impairment was primarily caused by significant sustained currency headwinds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which are expected to continue into fiscal 2023 and are included within the cash flow models, a decrease in the branded sales forecast, increases in input costs, and a higher discount rate.\nThe quantitative estimated fair values were determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, which requires significant assumptions for each brand, including estimates related to revenue growth rates, gross margin rates, operating expenses (SG&A, R&D, and A&P) and discount rates. The projections for our Armor All, STP and Rayovac fair value models are generated using the companys three-year strategic plan, the Company's annual budget plan for fiscal 2023, and long-term category projections, to determine forecasted cash flows and operating data. Specifically, revenue growth assumptions are based on historical trends and managements expectations for future growth by brand and category. Gross margin rate assumptions are based on historical trends and management's cost cutting strategies. Operating expenses are based on historical trends and management's annual budget plan for fiscal 2023, as well as long-term operating and advertising strategies. The discount rates used in the trade name fair value estimates ranged between 9.5% and 10.0%, and are based on a weighted-average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of similar companies. The new carrying values for Armor All, STP, and Rayovac trade names are $228.5, $76.4, and $422.2, respectively.

These factors include (i) failure to achieve forecasted revenue growth rates, (ii) failure to achieve cost cutting and margin improvement initiatives the Company is implementing, (iii) failure to meet forecasted operating expenses, or (iv) increases in the discount rate.\nSTP is within the fuel and oil additives category and due to the current expectation for an increased percentage of electric vehicles in the car parc over the long term, the Company has converted the STP trade name into a definite-life intangible asset with a 25 year useful life. This conversion will result in additional pre-tax amortization expense of approximately $3.0 in fiscal 2023.\nFinally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, a qualitative analysis was performed over the Energizer, Eveready and Varta trade names and no impairments were identified.

The Company wrote-off a total of $18.1 and $20.7 of debt issuance fees as a result of the extinguishment activity during fiscal year 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nInterest Rate Swaps - In March 2017, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with one major financial institution that fixed the variable benchmark component (LIBOR) on $200.0 of Energizer's variable rate debt through June 2022 at an interest rate of 2.03%. In February 2018, the Company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap with an effective date of October 1, 2018, with one major financial institution that fixed the variable benchmark component (LIBOR) on additional variable rate debt at an interest rate of 2.47%. At the effective date, the swap had a notional value of $400.0. Beginning April 1, 2019, the notional amount decreases $50.0 each quarter, and continued to decrease until its termination date of December 31, 2020.\nIn conjunction with the term loan refinance in December 2020, the Company terminated both of these interest rate swaps and entered into a new interest rate swap with the effective date of December 22, 2020, that fixed the variable benchmark component (LIBOR) at an interest rate of 0.95% on variable rate debt of $550.0. On January 22, 2021 the notional value\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\nincreased to $700.0 and will stay at that value through December 22, 2024. The notional value will decrease by $100.0 on December 2024 and by $100.0 each year thereafter until its termination date on December 22, 2027.\nNotes Payable - The notes payable balance was $6.4 at September 30, 2022 and $105.0 at September 30, 2021. The 2022 balance is comprised other borrowings, including those from foreign affiliates. The 2021 balance was comprised of outstanding borrowings on the 2020 Revolving Facility.\nDebt Covenants - The agreements governing the Company's debt contain certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and provisions relating to events of default. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants or with other requirements of these agreements, the lenders may have the right to accelerate the maturity of the debt. Acceleration under one of these facilities would trigger cross defaults to other borrowings. As of September 30, 2022, the Company was in compliance with the provisions and covenants associated with its debt agreements.\nThe counterparties to long-term committed borrowings consist of a number of major financial institutions. The Company consistently monitors positions with, and credit ratings of, counterparties both internally and by using outside ratings agencies.\nFinance Lease Obligations - In fiscal year 2022, the Company entered into a termination agreement with the landlord of our finance lease in Dixon, IL. The Company terminated the lease agreement, which went into 2028, reducing our finance lease obligations by $9.8. The termination agreement required the Company to pay a termination fee of $4.0, as well as decommissioning costs and brokerage fees. Since the Company has already vacated the facility as a part of the 2019 restructuring program, most assets associated with the location have already been fully depreciated. The termination of this lease resulted in a gain of $4.5 recognized in Other items, net during fiscal 2022.\nDebt Maturities - Aggregate maturities of long-term debt as of September 30, 2022 were as follows:\nLong-term debt\n2023 $ 12.0\n2024 12.0\n2025 12.0\n2026 12.0\n2027 12.0\nThereafter 3,459.1\nTotal long-term debt payments due $ 3,519.1\n(14) Pension Plans\nThe Company has several defined benefit pension plans covering many of its employees in the U.S. and certain employees in other countries.

Investment policy for the U.S. plan includes a mandate to diversify assets and invest in a variety of assets classes to achieve that goal. The U.S. plan's assets are currently invested in several funds representing most standard equity and debt security classes. The broad target allocations are approximately: (a) equities, including U.S. and foreign: 30%, and (b) debt securities, including U.S. bonds: 70%. Actual allocations at September 30, 2022 approximated these targets. The U.S. plan held no shares of Company common stock at September 30, 2022.

The investment philosophy is to achieve this objective through diversification of the retirement plan assets. The goal is to earn a suitable return with an appropriate level of risk while maintaining adequate liquidity to distribute benefit payments. The diversified asset allocation includes equity positions, as well as fixed income investments. The increased volatility associated with equities is offset with higher expected returns, while the long duration fixed income investments help dampen the volatility of the overall portfolio. Risk exposure is controlled by re-balancing the retirement plan assets back to target allocations, as needed. Investment firms managing retirement plan assets carry out investment policy within their stated guidelines. Investment performance is monitored against benchmark indices, which reflect the policy and target allocation of the retirement plan assets.\n(15) Defined Contribution Plan\nThe Company sponsors defined contribution plans globally, which extends participation eligibility to the vast majority of employees. In the U.S., the Company matches 100% of participants before tax or Roth contributions up to 6% of eligible compensation. Amounts charged to expense for the U.S. plan during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $10.4, $10.3, and $9.6, respectively, and are reflected in SG&A and Cost of products sold in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income.\n(16) Shareholders' Equity\nThe Company's articles of incorporation authorized 300 million shares of common stock and 10 million shares of preferred stock, each with a par value of $0.01 per share. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had 77,074,245 and 72,386,840, respectively, of common stock issued. During fiscal 2022, all outstanding shares of the Company's 7.50% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (MCPS) automatically converted into shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a rate of 2.1739 shares of the Company's common stock for each share of preferred stock. This resulted in the issuance of approximately 4.7 million shares of common stock.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had approximately 2.5 million shares reserved for issuance under the Equity Incentive Plan and approximately 75,700 shares reserved for issuance under the deferred compensation plan.\nOn November 12, 2020, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program for up to 7.5 million shares of its common stock, replacing the prior authorization from July 2015. During fiscal 2021, the Company entered into a $75.0\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\naccelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. Under the terms of the agreement, approximately 1.5 million shares were delivered in fiscal 2021 and an additional approximately 0.5 million shares were delivered upon termination of the agreement on November 18, 2021. The total number of shares delivered was based on the volume-weighted average stock prices (VWAP) of the Companys common stock during the ASR period of $38.30. The Company paid the full amount of the ASR in fiscal 2021 and recorded $60.0 of treasury stock representing the approximately 1.5 million shares delivered in fiscal 2021 and the remaining $15.0 was recorded as Additional paid in capital. With the delivery of the additional shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the $15.0 was reclassified to treasury stock on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn addition to the ASR program, the Company has repurchased 500,000 shares for $21.3, at an average price of $42.61 per share, and 980,000 shares for $45.0, at an average price of $45.93 per share, during the twelve months ended 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had approximately 5.0 million shares still authorized under this authorization. Future share repurchases, if any, would be made on the open market and the timing and the amount of any purchases will be determined by the Company based on its evaluation of the market conditions, capital allocation objectives, legal and regulatory requirements and other factors.\nFor the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, total dividends declared to shareholders were $85.5 and $84.9 was paid. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, total dividends declared to shareholders were $82.6 and $83.9 was paid. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, total dividends declared to shareholders were $84.0 and $85.4 was paid. The dividends paid included amounts on restricted shares that vested in the period.\nSubsequent to the fiscal year end, on November 7, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 of $0.30 per share of common stock, payable on December 16, 2022, to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 28, 2022.\nSeries A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock - In January 2019, the Company issued 2,156,250 shares of Series A (MCPS), with a par value of $0.01 per share and liquidation preference of $100.00 per share. On January 15, 2022, all outstanding shares of the Company's 7.50% Series A MCPS automatically converted into shares of the Company's common stock. There were 2,156,250 preferred shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2021.\nDividends on the MCPS were payable on a cumulative basis at an annual rate of 7.50% of the liquidation preference of $100.00 per share of MCPS and paid in cash. The Company paid a cash dividend of $1.875 per share of MCPS on October 15, 2021 which had been declared in fiscal 2021. On November 15, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.875 per share of MCPS to all shareholders of record as of the close of January 1, 2022, which was paid on January 15, 2022. No dividends were paid after January 2022.\n(17) Financial Instruments and Risk Management\nThe market risk inherent in the Company's operations creates potential earnings volatility arising from changes in currency rates, interest rates and commodity prices. The Company's policy allows derivatives to be used only for identifiable exposures and, therefore, the Company does not enter into hedges for trading or speculative purposes where the sole objective is to generate profits.\nConcentration of Credit Risk - The counterparties to derivative contracts consist of a number of major financial institutions and are generally institutions with which the Company maintains lines of credit. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts through brokers nor does it trade derivative contracts on any other exchange or over-the-counter markets. Risk of currency positions and mark-to-market valuation of positions are strictly monitored at all times.\nThe Company continually monitors positions with, and credit ratings of, counterparties both internally and by using outside rating agencies. While nonperformance by these counterparties exposes Energizer to potential credit losses, such losses are not anticipated.\nThe Company sells to a large number of customers primarily in the retail trade, including those in mass merchandising, drugstore, supermarket and other channels of distribution throughout the world. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounted for 12.9%, 13.7%, and 14.1% of total net sales in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily in North America. The Company performs ongoing evaluations of its customers financial condition and creditworthiness, but does not generally require\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\ncollateral. While the competitiveness of the retail industry presents an inherent uncertainty, the Company does not believe a significant risk of loss from a concentration of credit risk exists with respect to accounts receivable.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contractual arrangements (derivatives) to reduce its exposure to commodity price and foreign currency risks. The section below outlines the types of derivatives that existed at September 30, 2022 and 2021, as well as the Company's objectives and strategies for holding these derivative instruments.\nCommodity Price Risk - The Company uses raw materials that are subject to price volatility. At times, the Company uses hedging instruments to reduce exposure to variability in cash flows associated with future purchases of certain materials and commodities.\nForeign Currency Risk - A significant portion of Energizers product cost is more closely tied to the U.S. dollar than to the local currencies in which the product is sold. As such, a weakening of currencies relative to the U.S. dollar results in margin declines unless mitigated through pricing actions, which are not always available due to the economic or competitive environment. Conversely, a strengthening in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can improve margins. The primary currencies to which Energizer is exposed include the Euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. However, the Company also has significant exposures in many other currencies which, in the aggregate, may have a material impact on the Company's operations.\nAdditionally, Energizers foreign subsidiaries enter into internal and external transactions that create nonfunctional currency balance sheet positions at the foreign subsidiary level. These exposures are generally the result of intercompany purchases, intercompany loans and, to a lesser extent, external purchases, and are revalued in the foreign subsidiarys local currency at the end of each period. Changes in the value of the non-functional currency balance sheet positions in relation to the foreign subsidiarys local currency results in a transaction gain or loss recorded in Other items, net on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The primary currency to which Energizers foreign subsidiaries are exposed is the U.S. dollar.\nInterest Rate Risk - Energizer has interest rate risk with respect to interest expense on variable rate debt. At September 30, 2022, Energizer had variable rate debt outstanding with a principal balance of $1,188.4 under the 2020 Term Loans and international borrowings. There were no outstanding borrowings on the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2022.\nIn December 2020, the Company entered into an interest rate swap (2020 interest rate swap) with an effective date of December 22, 2020, that fixed the variable benchmark component (LIBOR) at an interest rate of 0.95% on variable debt of $550.0. The notional value increased to $700.0 on January 22, 2021 and will stay at that value through December 22, 2024. The notional value will decrease by $100.0 on December 22, 2024 and by $100.0 each year thereafter until its termination date on December 22, 2027. The notional value of the swap was $700.0 as September 30, 2022.\nDerivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedging Relationships - The Company has entered into a series of forward currency contracts to hedge the cash flow uncertainty of forecasted payment of inventory purchases due to short term currency fluctuations. Energizers primary foreign affiliates, which are exposed to U.S. dollar purchases, have the Euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar as their local currencies. These foreign currencies represent a significant portion of Energizer's foreign currency exposure. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, Energizer had unrealized pre-tax gains of $16.3 and $5.0, respectively, included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Assuming foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar remain at September 30, 2022 levels, over the next twelve months, $15.7 of the pre-tax gain included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss is expected to be recognized in earnings. Contract maturities for these hedges extend into fiscal 2024. There were 62 open foreign currency contracts at September 30, 2022, with a total notional value of approximately $176.\nThe Company has a hedging program on zinc purchases. The contracts were determined to be cash flow hedges and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. The contract maturities for these hedges extend into fiscal 2024. There were 10 open contracts at September 30, 2022, with a total notional value of approximately $38. The unrealized pre-tax loss on the zinc contracts was $6.1 at September 30, 2022 and the unrealized pre-tax gain recorded on zinc contracts was $4.7 at 2021. These were included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, Energizer recorded an unrealized pre-tax gain of $86.4 and $11.7, respectively, on the 2020 Interest rate swap agreement contracts, which was included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nPreviously the Company had another interest rate swap that was terminated early in December 2020 and resulted in a $5.6 loss, which was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This loss was amortized into interest expense over the remainder of the interest payments associated with the Term Loan through June 2022, the original ending date of the interest rate swap.\nDerivatives not Designated in Hedging Relationships - In addition, Energizer enters into foreign currency derivative contracts which are not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes to hedge existing balance sheet exposures. Any gains or losses on these contracts would be offset by corresponding exchange losses or gains on the underlying exposures; thus are not subject to significant market risk. There were 10 open foreign currency derivative contracts which are not designated as cash flow hedges at September 30, 2022, with a total notional value of approximately $122.\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\nThe following table provides the Company's estimated fair values as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments classified as cash flow hedges as of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively:\nAt September 30, 2022 For the Year Ended September 30, 2022\nDerivatives designated as Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Estimated Fair Value Asset / (Liability) (1) Gain / (Loss) Recognized in OCI (2) Gain / (Loss) Reclassified\nFrom OCI into Income (Effective Portion) (3) (4)\nForeign currency contracts $ 16.3 $ 20.9 $ 9.6\nInterest rate swaps 86.4 75.2 (2.5)\nZinc contracts (6.1) (1.4) 9.4\nTotal $ 96.6 $ 94.7 $ 16.5\nAt September 30, 2021 For the Year Ended September 30, 2021\nDerivatives designated as Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Estimated Fair Value Asset (1) (Loss) / Gain Recognized in OCI (2) (Loss) / Gain Reclassified\nFrom OCI into Income (Effective Portion) (3) (4)\nForeign currency contracts $ 5.0 $ (0.5) $ (10.4)\nInterest rate swaps 11.7 9.9 (6.7)\nZinc contracts 4.7 4.5 4.2\nTotal $ 21.4 $ 13.9 $ (12.9)\n(1) All derivative assets are presented in Other current assets or Other assets.

The following table sets forth the Company's financial assets and liabilities, which are carried at fair value, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 that are measured on a recurring basis during the period, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy:\nLevel 2\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021\n(Liabilities)/Assets at estimated fair value:\nDeferred Compensation $ (24.6) $ (25.1)\nDerivatives - Foreign Currency contracts 16.3 5.0\nDerivatives - Foreign Currency contracts (non-hedge) (0.6) -\nDerivatives - Interest Rate Swaps 86.4 11.7\nDerivatives - Zinc contracts (6.1) $ 4.7\nNet Assets/(Liabilities) at estimated fair value $ 71.4 $ (3.7)\nEnergizer had no level 1 financial assets or liabilities, other than pension plan assets, and no level 3 financial assets or liabilities at September 30, 2022 and 2021. The Company does measure certain assets and liabilities, such as Goodwill and Other intangibles, at fair value on a non-recurring basis using level 3 inputs. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the Company recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $541.9. These losses were recorded as Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Refer to Note 12 Goodwill and Intangible Assets for additional information. There were no level 3 fair value measurement losses recognized during the years ended September 30, 2021 or 2020.\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\nDue to the nature of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, carrying amounts on the balance sheets approximate estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of cash was determined based on level 1 inputs and cash equivalents and restricted cash are determined based on level 2 inputs.\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, the estimated fair value of the Company's unfunded deferred compensation liability is determined based upon the quoted market prices of investment options that are offered under the plan. The estimated fair value of foreign currency contracts, interest rate swap and zinc contracts, as described above, is the amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts, considering first, quoted market prices of comparable agreements, or in the absence of quoted market prices, such factors as interest rates, currency exchange rates and remaining maturities.\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, the fair market value of fixed rate long-term debt was $1,795.7 and $2,156.1, respectively, compared to its carrying value of $2,337.1 and $2,152.7, respectively. The estimated fair value of the long-term debt is estimated using yields obtained from independent pricing sources for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The estimated fair value of fixed rate long-term debt has been determined based on level 2 inputs.\n(18) Other Commitments and Contingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company also enters into supply and service contracts. These contracts can include either volume commitments or fixed expiration dates, termination provisions and other standard contractual considerations. At September 30, 2022, the Company had approximately $21.5 of purchase obligations.\n(19) Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss)/Income\nThe following table presents the changes in accumulated other comprehensive (loss)/income (AOCI), net of tax by component:\nForeign Currency Translation Adjustments Pension Activity Zinc Contracts Foreign Currency Contracts Interest Rate Swap Total\nBalance at September 30, 2019 $ (124.0) $ (173.3) $ 0.2 $ 3.1 $ (4.3) (298.3)\nOCI before reclassifications (32.7) 0.3 2.9 (4.7) (5.1) (39.3)\nReclassifications to earnings -

In accordance with the terms of our Shareholder Agreement with Spectrum, Spectrum had the right to sell such shares on or after January 28, 2020, including through one or more registered secondary offerings. At September 30, 2020, Spectrum owned 1.7 million shares, or 2.5% of the Company's outstanding common shares. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Spectrum sold the remainder of their shares, and as such at September 30, 2021 they are no longer considered to be a related party.\nThe transactions between Spectrum and Energizer prior to when Spectrum sold their remaining shares during fiscal 2021 were immaterial. The transactions discussed below cover the time period in which Spectrum was a related party of Energizer Holdings, Inc. in fiscal 2020.\nFollowing the completion of the Battery and Auto Care Acquisitions, the Company and Spectrum entered into transition service agreements (TSA) and reverse TSA. Under the agreements, Energizer and Spectrum provided each other certain specified back office support services on a transitional basis, including among other things, payroll and other human resource services, information systems as well as accounting support.\nThe charges for the transition services are generally intended to allow the providing company to fully recover the allocated direct costs of providing the services, plus all out-of-pocket costs and expenses, and including a nominal profit. As of September 30, 2020, the Company had exited the majority of the TSA and reverse TSA, and during the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company was out of all agreements.\nDuring the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, the Company paid $2.3 to Spectrum related to rent for office space at their Middleton, Wisconsin headquarters.\nFor the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, the Company incurred expense of $8.4 in SG&A and $0.4 in Cost of products sold. The Company also recorded income of $0.9 in Other items, net related to the reverse transaction services agreements provided for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020.\nThe Company also entered into a supply agreement with Spectrum, ancillary to the Auto Care Acquisition that became effective upon the consummation of the acquisition. The supply agreement resulted in expense to the Company of $17.8 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020.\nIn discontinued operations, the Company recorded income of $3.8 for reverse TSA, and recorded expense of $0.3 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020.\n(22) Environmental and Regulatory\nGovernment Regulation and Environmental Matters - The operations of Energizer are subject to various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations intended to protect the public health and the environment. These regulations relate primarily to worker safety, air and water quality, underground fuel storage tanks and waste handling, collection, recycling and disposal. In connection with some sites, Energizer has been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and may be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to certain federal Superfund sites. Energizer may also be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to state-designated sites or other sites outside of the U.S.\nAccrued environmental costs at September 30, 2022 were $15.4, of which $5.3 is expected to be spent during fiscal 2023. It is difficult to quantify with certainty the cost of environmental matters, particularly remediation and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment. Environmental spending estimates could be modified as a result of changes in legal requirements or the enforcement or interpretation of existing requirements.\nLegal Proceedings - The Company and its affiliates are subject to a number of legal proceedings in various jurisdictions arising out of its operations. Many of these legal matters are in preliminary stages and involve complex issues of law and fact, and may proceed for protracted periods of time. The amount of liability, if any, from these proceedings cannot be determined with certainty. The Company and its affiliates are a party to legal proceedings and claims that arise during the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews its legal proceedings and claims, regulatory reviews and inspections on an ongoing basis and\nENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\nfollows appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions. The Company establishes accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and discloses the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading. The Company does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated.
