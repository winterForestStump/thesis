    "content": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nGriffon Corporation (the Company or Griffon, \"we\", \"us\") is a diversified management and holding company that conducts business through wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company, founded in 1959, is a Delaware corporation headquartered in New York, N.Y. and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:GFF).\nBusiness Strategy\nWe own and operate, and seek to acquire, businesses in multiple industries and geographic markets. Our objective is to maintain leading positions in the markets we serve by providing innovative, branded products with superior quality and industry-leading service. We place emphasis on our iconic and well-respected brands, which helps to differentiate us and our offerings from our competitors and strengthens our relationship with our customers and those who ultimately use our products.\nThrough operating a diverse portfolio of businesses, we expect to reduce variability caused by external factors such as market cyclicality, seasonality, and weather. We achieve diversity by providing various product offerings and brands through multiple sales and distribution channels and conducting business across multiple countries which we consider our home markets.\nGriffon oversees the operations of its subsidiaries, allocates resources among them and manages their capital structures. Griffon provides direction and assistance to its subsidiaries in connection with acquisition and growth opportunities as well as in connection with divestitures. As long-term investors, having substantial experience in a variety of industries, our intent is to continue the growth and strengthening of our existing businesses, and to diversify further through investments in our businesses and through acquisitions.\nOver the past five years, we have undertaken a series of transformative transactions. We divested our specialty plastics business in 2018 to focus on our core markets and improve our free cash flow conversion. In our Consumer and Professional Products (\"CPP\") segment, we expanded the scope of our brands through the acquisition of Hunter Fan Company (\"Hunter\") on January 24, 2022 and ClosetMaid, LLC (\"ClosetMaid\") in 2018. In our Home and Building Products (\"HBP\") segment, we acquired CornellCookson, Inc. (\"CornellCookson\") in 2018, which has been integrated into Clopay Corporation (\"Clopay\"), creating a leading North American manufacturer and marketer of residential garage doors and sectional commercial doors, and rolling steel doors and grille products under brands that include Clopay, Ideal, Cornell and Cookson. We established an integrated headquarters for CPP in Orlando, Florida for our portfolio of leading brands that includes AMES, Hunter, True Temper and ClosetMaid. CPP is well positioned to fulfill its ongoing mission of Bringing Brands Together\u2122 with the leading brands in consumer and professional tools; residential, industrial and commercial fans; home storage and organization products; and products that enhance indoor and outdoor lifestyles.\nOn May 16, 2022, Griffon announced that its Board of Directors initiated a process to review a comprehensive range of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value including a sale, merger, divestiture, recapitalization or other strategic transaction. This process is active and discussions with potential counterparties are ongoing with respect to a number of these options. The Committee on Strategic Considerations, a committee comprised of independent directors who serve on Griffon's Board, is overseeing the process and working with Griffon's management and Goldman Sachs & Co, LLC. the Company's financial advisor. There is no assurance that the process will result in any transaction being entered into or consummated.\nOn September 27, 2021, we announced we were exploring strategic alternatives for our Defense Electronics (\"DE\") segment, which consisted of our Telephonics Corporation (\"Telephonics\") subsidiary. On June 27, 2022, we completed the sale of Telephonics to TTM Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTMI) (\"TTM\") for $330,000 in cash, excluding customary post-closing adjustments, primarily related to working capital. Griffon classified the results of operations of our Telephonics business as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operation in the consolidated balance sheets. Accordingly, all references made to results and information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to Griffon's continuing operations, unless noted otherwise.\nOn December 17, 2021, Griffon entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Hunter, a market leader in residential ceiling, commercial, and industrial fans, from MidOcean Partners (MidOcean) for a contractual purchase price of $845,000 and completed the acquisition on January 24, 2022. Hunter, part of our CPP segment, complements and diversifies our portfolio of leading consumer brands and products. We financed the acquisition of Hunter with a new $800,000 seven-year Term Loan B facility; we used a combination of cash on hand and revolver borrowings to fund the balance of the purchase price and related acquisition and debt expenditures.\nUpdate of COVID-19 on Our Business\nThe health and safety of our employees, our customers and their families is always a high priority for Griffon. As of the date of this filing, all of Griffon's facilities are fully operational. Our supply chain experienced and, to some extent, is still recovering from certain disruptions which, together with other factors such as a shortage of labor, resulted in longer delivery lead times and restricted manufacturing capacity for certain of our products. When COVID-19 struck, we implemented a variety of new policies and procedures, including additional cleaning, social distancing, staggered shifts and prohibiting or significantly restricting on-site visitors, to minimize the risk to our employees of contracting COVID-19. While many of these precautions have been relaxed or eliminated as the health risk of COVID-19 has decreased, we would not hesitate to reinstitute and/or modify these policies and procedures as necessary should the health risk return to an unacceptable level. In such event, our businesses or our suppliers could be required by government authorities to temporarily cease operations; might be limited in their production capacity due to complying with restrictions relating to the operation of businesses to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19; or could suffer their own supply chain disruptions, impacting their ability to continue to supply us with the quantity of materials required by us.\nWe will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take actions that impact our operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders. While we are unable to determine or predict the nature, duration or scope of the overall impact COVID-19 will have on our businesses, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, we believe it is important to discuss where our company stands today, how we have responded (and will continue to respond) to COVID 19 and how our operations and financial condition may change as COVID-19 evolves.\nGriffon believes it has adequate liquidity to invest in its existing businesses and execute its business plan, while managing its capital structure on both a short-term and long-term basis. At September 30, 2022, $290,385 of revolver capacity was available under Griffon's Credit Agreement and Griffon had cash and equivalents of $120,184.\nOther Business Highlights\nIn August 2020 Griffon completed the Public Offering of 8,700,000 shares of our common stock for total net proceeds of $178,165. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under its Credit Agreement. The Company used the remainder of the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nDuring 2020, Griffon issued, at par, $1,000,000 of 5.75% Senior Notes due in 2028 (the 2028 Senior Notes). Proceeds from the 2028 Senior Notes were used to redeem the $1,000,000 of 5.25% Senior Notes due in 2022.\nIn January 2020, Griffon amended its credit agreement to increase the total amount available for borrowing from $350,000 to $400,000, extend its maturity date from March 22, 2021 to March 22, 2025 and modify certain other provisions of the facility (the \"Credit Agreement\").\nIn November 2019, Griffon announced the development of a next-generation business platform for CPP to enhance the growth, efficiency, and competitiveness of its U.S. operations, and on November 12, 2020, Griffon announced that CPP is broadening this strategic initiative to include additional North American facilities, the AMES United Kingdom (U.K.) and Australia businesses, and a manufacturing facility in China. On April 28, 2022, Griffon announced a reduced scope and an accelerated timeline for the initiative, which was completed in fiscal 2022. These changes reflect the rapid progress made with the initiative, and reduced investment in facilities expansion and equipment given recent significant increases in construction and equipment costs. Any remaining expenditures, after the end of fiscal 2022, including those related to the deployment of AMES' global information systems, will be included in the continuing operations of the business. Future investments in equipment, particularly for automation, will be part of normal-course annual capital expenditures.\nThis initiative included three key development areas. First, certain AMES U.S. and global operations were consolidated to optimize facilities footprint and talent. Second, strategic investments in automation and facilities expansion were made to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing and fulfillment operations, and support e-commerce growth. Third, multiple\nindependent information systems were unified into a single data and analytics platform, which will serve the whole AMES global enterprise.\nWe continue to expect that this initiative will result in annual cash savings of $25,000. Realization of expected cash savings will begin in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The cost to implement this new business platform, over the duration of the project, included one-time charges of approximately $51,869 and capital investments of approximately $15,000, net of future proceeds from the sale of exited facilities.\nIn June 2018, Clopay acquired CornellCookson, a leading provider of rolling steel service doors, fire doors, and grilles, for an effective purchase price of approximately $170,000. This transaction strengthened Clopay's strategic portfolio with a line of commercial rolling steel door products to complement Clopay's sectional door offerings in the commercial sector, and expanded the Clopay network of professional dealers focused on the commercial market.\nIn March 2018, we announced the combination of the ClosetMaid operations with those of AMES, which improved operational efficiencies by leveraging the complementary products, customers, warehousing and distribution, manufacturing, and sourcing capabilities of the two businesses.\nIn February 2018, we closed on the sale of our Clopay Plastics Products (\"Plastics\") business to Berry Global, Inc. (\"Berry\") for approximately $465,000, net of certain post-closing adjustments, thus exiting the specialty plastics industry that the Company had entered when it acquired Clopay Corporation in 1986. This transaction provided immediate liquidity and improved Griffon's cash flow given the historically higher capital needs of the Plastics operations as compared to Griffons remaining businesses.\nIn October 2017, we acquired ClosetMaid from Emerson Electric Co. (NYSE:EMR) for an effective purchase price of approximately $165,000. ClosetMaid, founded in 1965, is a leading North American manufacturer and marketer of wood and wire closet organization, general living storage and wire garage storage products, and sells to some of the largest home center retail chains, mass merchandisers, and direct-to-builder professional installers in North America. We believe that ClosetMaid is the leading brand in its category, with excellent consumer recognition.\nWe believe these actions have established a solid foundation for growth in sales, profit, and cash generation and bolster Griffons platforms for opportunistic strategic acquisitions.\nOther Acquisitions and Dispositions\nOn December 22, 2020, AMES acquired Quatro Design Pty Ltd (Quatro), a leading Australian manufacturer and supplier of glass fiber reinforced concrete landscaping products for residential, commercial, and public sector projects for a purchase price of AUD $3,500 (approximately $2,700). Quatro contributed approximately $5,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nOn November 29, 2019, AMES acquired Vatre Group Limited (\"Apta\"), a leading U.K. supplier of innovative garden pottery and associated products sold to leading U.K. and Ireland garden centers for approximately $10,500 (GBP 8,750), inclusive of a post-closing working capital adjustment, net of cash acquired. This acquisition broadens AMES' product offerings in the U.K. market and increases its in-country operational footprint. Apta contributed approximately $20,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nOn February 13, 2018, AMES acquired Kelkay, a leading U.K. manufacturer and distributor of decorative outdoor landscaping products sold to garden centers, retailers and grocers in the U.K. and Ireland. This acquisition broadened AMES' product offerings in the market and increased its in-country operational footprint.\nIn November 2017, Griffon acquired Harper Brush Works, a leading U.S. manufacturer of cleaning products for professional, home, and industrial use, from Horizon Global (NYSE:HZN). This acquisition expanded the AMES line of long-handle tools in North America to include brooms, brushes, and other cleaning products.\nDuring fiscal 2017, Griffon also completed a number of other acquisitions to expand and enhance AMES' global footprint. In the United Kingdom, Griffon acquired La Hacienda, an outdoor living brand of unique heating and garden d\u00e9cor products, in July 2017. The acquisition of La Hacienda, together with the February 2018 acquisition of Kelkay and November 2020 acquisition of Apta, provides AMES with additional brands and a platform for growth in the U.K. market and access to leading garden centers, retailers, and grocers in the UK and Ireland. In Australia, Griffon acquired Hills Home Living, the iconic brand\nof clotheslines and home products, from Hills Limited (ASX:HIL) in December 2016, and in September 2017 Griffon acquired Tuscan Path, an Australian provider of pots, planters, pavers, decorative stone, and garden d\u00e9cor products. The Hills, Tuscan Path and December, 2020 Quatro acquisitions broadened AMES' outdoor living and lawn and garden business, strengthening AMES portfolio of brands and its market position in Australia and New Zealand.\nFurther Information\nGriffon posts and makes available, free of charge through its website at www.griffon.com, its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as press releases, as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are published or filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). The information found on Griffon's website is not part of this or any other report it files with or furnishes to the SEC.\nFor information regarding revenue, profit and total assets of each segment, see the Reportable Segments footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nReportable Segments:\nGriffon conducts its operations through two reportable segments:\nConsumer and Professional Products (CPP) is a leading North American manufacturer and a global provider of branded consumer and professional tools; residential, industrial and commercial fans; home storage and organization products; and products that enhance indoor and outdoor lifestyles. CPP sells products globally through a portfolio of leading brands including AMES, since 1774, Hunter, since 1886, True Temper, and ClosetMaid.\nHome and Building Products (\"HBP\") conducts its operations through Clopay. Founded in 1964, Clopay is the largest manufacturer and marketer of garage doors and rolling steel doors in North America. Residential and commercial sectional garage doors are sold through professional dealers and leading home center retail chains throughout North America under the brands Clopay, Ideal, and Holmes. Rolling steel door and grille products designed for commercial, industrial, institutional, and retail use are sold under the Cornell and Cookson brands.\nReportable Segments:\nCONSUMER AND PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS\nConsumer and Professional Products (CPP) is a leading North American manufacturer and a global provider of branded consumer and professional tools; residential, industrial and commercial fans; home storage and organization products; and products that enhance indoor and outdoor lifestyles. CPP sells products globally through a portfolio of leading brands including AMES, Hunter and ClosetMaid. AMES, founded in Massachusetts in 1774, has the distinction of being one of the oldest companies in continuous operation in the United States. Over its long life, AMES has grown organically and through the acquisition of other leading and historic tool businesses such as True Temper, Union Tools, and Garant. Today, AMES is a leading manufacturer of long-handled tools and landscaping products for homeowners and professionals in North America, and also provides these products in key global markets including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., and Ireland. Under the ClosetMaid brand, CPP is the leading provider of wood and wire closet organization, general living storage, and wire garage storage products in the United States. Under the Hunter brand, since 1886, CPP is a leading provider of residential, industrial and commercial fans in the United States.\nSince the acquisition of AMES by Griffon in 2010, CPP has benefited from strategic acquisitions that have expanded its product portfolio and geographic presence. The Hunter Fan, ClosetMaid, Southern Patio, and Harper Brush Works acquisitions added to, or expanded CPP's product categories in North America to include residential, industrial and commercial fans, storage and organization, decorative landscaping, and cleaning products. The acquisitions of Northcote, Cyclone, Hills, Nylex, Tuscan Path and Quatro in Australia established AMES as a leading supplier of tools and landscaping categories in the Australian market. As a result of the acquisitions of Kelkay, La Hacienda and Apta, the U.K. and Ireland have become key markets for AMES products.\nCPP has approximately 3,200 employees worldwide.\nBrands\nCPP's brands are among the most recognized across its primary product categories in North America, Australia and the United Kingdom. Its brand portfolio for long-handled tools, outdoor d\u00e9cor, and landscaping product includes AMES\u00ae, True Temper\u00ae, Garant\u00ae, Harper\u00ae, UnionTools\u00ae, Westmix\u2122, Cyclone\u00ae, Southern Patio\u00ae, Northcote Pottery\u2122, Nylex\u00ae, Hills\u00ae, Kelkay\u00ae, Tuscan Path\u00ae, La Hacienda\u00ae, Kelso\u2122, Dynamic Design\u00ae\u2122, Apta\u00ae and Quatro Design\u00ae. Contractor-oriented tool brands include Razor-Back\u00ae Professional Tools and Jackson\u00ae Professional Tools. CPP's home organization, general living storage, and garage storage products are sold primarily under the ClosetMaid\u00ae brand. CPP's residential, industrial and commercial fan products are sold under the Hunter Fan and Casablanca brands.\nThis strong portfolio of brands enables CPP to build and maintain long-standing relationships with leading retailers and distributors. In addition, given the breadth of its brand portfolio and product category depth, CPP is able to offer specific, differentiated branding strategies for key retail customers. These strategies focus on enhancement of brand value, with the goal of de-commoditizing CPP products through identity and functionality elements that makes each top brand unique, attractive and visually recognizable by the consumer.\nProducts\nCPP manufactures and markets a broad portfolio of long-handled tools, landscaping products, home organization products and residential, industrial and commercial fans. This portfolio contains many iconic brands and is anchored by six core product categories: seasonal outdoor tools, project tools, outdoor d\u00e9cor and watering, home organization, fans and cleaning products. As a result of brand portfolio recognition, outstanding product quality, industry leading service and strong customer relationships, CPP has earned market-leading positions in its six core product categories. The following is a brief description of CPP's primary product lines:\nSeasonal Outdoor Tools\nLong-Handled Tools: An extensive line of engineered tools including shovels, spades, scoops, rakes, hoes, cultivators, weeders, post hole diggers, scrapers, edgers and forks, marketed under leading brand names including AMES\u00ae, True Temper\u00ae, UnionTools\u00ae, Garant\u00ae, Cyclone\u00ae and Kelso\u2122, as well as contractor-oriented brands including Razor-Back\u00ae Jackson\u00ae and Darby\u2122.\nWheelbarrows: AMES designs, develops and manufactures a full line of wheelbarrows and lawn carts, primarily under the AMES\u00ae, True Temper\u00ae, Jackson\u00ae Professional Tools, UnionTools\u00ae, Garant\u00ae and Westmix\u2122 brand names. The products range in size, material (poly and steel), tray form, tire type, handle length and color based on the needs of homeowners, landscapers and contractors.\nSnow Tools: A complete line of snow tools is marketed under the True Temper\u00ae, Garant\u00ae and Union Tools\u00ae brand names. The snow tool line includes shovels, pushers, roof rakes, sled sleigh shovels, scoops and ice scrapers.\nPruning: The pruning line is made up of pruners, loppers, shears, and other tools sold primarily under the True Temper\u00ae, Cyclone\u00ae and Garant\u00ae brand names.\nProject Tools\nStriking Tools: Axes, picks, mattocks, mauls, wood splitters, sledgehammers, pry bars and repair handles make up the striking tools product line. These products are marketed under the True Temper\u00ae, AMES\u00ae, Cyclone\u00ae, Garant\u00ae, Jackson\u00ae Professional Tools and Razor-Back\u00ae Professional Tools brand names.\nHand Tools: Hammers, screwdrivers, pliers, adjustable wrenches, handsaws, tape measures, levels, clamps, and other traditional hand tools make up this product line. These products are marketed under the Trojan\u00ae, Cyclone\u00ae and Supercraft\u00ae brand names. In addition, gardening hand tools, such as trowels, cultivators, weeders and other specialty garden hand tools, are marketed under the AMES\u00ae brand name.\nOutdoor D\u00e9cor and Watering\nPlanters and Lawn Accessories: AMES is a designer, manufacturer and distributor of indoor and outdoor planters and accessories, sold under the Southern Patio\u00ae, Northcote Pottery\u2122, Tuscan Path, La Hacienda\u00ae, Hills\u00ae, Kelkay\u00ae, Quatro Design\u00ae and Dynamic Design\u00ae\u2122 brand names, as well as various private label brands. The range of planter sizes (from 6 to 32 inches) is available in various designs, colors and materials.\nGarden Hose and Storage: AMES offers a wide range of manufactured and sourced garden hoses and hose reels under the AMES\u00ae, NeverLeak\u00ae and Nylex\u00ae brand names.\nHome Organization: AMES designs, manufactures and sells a comprehensive portfolio of wire and wood shelving, containers, storage cabinets and other closet and home organization accessories primarily under the highly recognized ClosetMaid\u00ae brand name and other private label brands. Wire products include wire shelving and hardware, wire accessories and kitchen storage products. Wire product brands include Maximum Load\u00ae, SuperSlide\u00ae and ShelfTrack\u00ae. Wood solutions include closet systems, cube storage, storage furniture and cabinets. Selected wood product brands include MasterSuite\u00ae, Suite Symphony\u00ae\u2122, ExpressShelf\u00ae, Style+\u00ae, and SpaceCreations\u00ae.\nFans: CPP designs and sells residential, industrial and commercial fans under the Hunter Fan and Casablanca brand names.\nCleaning Products: CPP offers a complete line of cleaning products for professional, home, and industrial use, including brooms, brushes, squeegees, and other cleaning products, primarily under the Harper\u00ae brand.\nCustomers\nCPP sells products throughout North America, Australia, New Zealand, the U.K. and Ireland through (1) home centers, such as The Home Depot, Inc. (Home Depot), Lowes Companies Inc. (Lowes), Rona Inc., Bunnings Warehouse (\"Bunnings\") and Woodies (with the average length of the relationship with these customers being approximately 30 years); (2) mass market, specialty, and hardware retailers including Tractor Supply Corporation (Tractor Supply), Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (\"Walmart\"), Target Corporation (\"Target\"), Canadian Tire Corporation, Limited (\"Canadian Tire\"), Costco Wholesale Corporation (\"Costco\"), Ace, Do-It-Best and True Value Company; (3) industrial distributors, such as W.W. Grainger, Inc. and ORS Nasco; (4) homebuilders, such as D.R. Horton, KB Home, Lennar and NVR, Inc.; and (5) E-commerce platforms, such as Amazon Inc. (Amazon), Wayfair Inc., (Wayfair), Hayneedle Inc., (Hayneedle), Overstock Inc. (Overstock) , and Spreetail LLC. (Spreetail).\nHome Depot, Lowe's, Menards and Bunnings are significant customers of CPP. The loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the CPP business and on Griffon.\nProduct Development\nCPP product development efforts focus on both new products and product line extensions. CPP continually improves existing products as well as develops new products to satisfy consumer needs, expand revenue opportunities, maintain or extend competitive advantages, increase market opportunity and reduce production costs. Products are developed through in-house industrial design and engineering staffs to introduce new products and product line extensions that are timely and cost effective.\nSales and Marketing\nCPP's sales organization is structured by product line and distribution channel in the U.S., and by country internationally. In the U.S., a dedicated team of sales professionals is provided for each of the large retail customers. Offices are maintained adjacent to each of the two largest customers headquarters, supported by a shared in-house sales analyst. In addition, sales professionals are assigned to domestic, wholesale and industrial distribution channels. Sales teams located in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Ireland handle sales in each of their respective regions. In Australia, a dedicated team of sales professionals is provided for the largest retail customer. CPP has made significant investments in automation, facilities expansion and fulfillment operations to support e-commerce growth.\nRaw Materials and Suppliers\nCPP's primary raw material inputs include resin (primarily polypropylene and high density polyethylene), wood (particleboard and hardwoods including ash, hickory and poplar logs) and steel (hot rolled, cold rolled, and wire rod). All raw materials are generally available from a number of sources. Certain components are purchased, such as heavy forged components and wheelbarrow tires. Most final assembly is completed internally in order to ensure consistent quality. CPP also sources certain finished goods, primarily in storage and organization, outdoor d\u00e9cor, residential, industrial and commercial fans, and tools for non-North American locations.\nCompetition\nThe long-handled tools and landscaping product industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Most competitors consist of small, privately-held companies focusing on a single product category. Some competitors, such as Fiskars Corporation in the hand tool and pruning tool market and Truper Herramientas S.A. de C.V. in the long-handled and garden tool space, compete in various tool categories. Suncast Corporation competes in the hose reel and accessory market, and more recently in the long-handled plastic snow shovel category. In addition, there is competition from imported or sourced products from China, India and other low-cost producing countries, particularly in long-handled tools, wheelbarrows, planters, striking tools and pruning tools.\nThe home storage and organizational solutions industry is also highly fragmented. CPP, primarily under the ClosetMaid brands, sells through retail, direct to consumer (e-commerce category) and direct to installer (building) channels and competes with a significant number of companies across each of these unique channels. Principal competition for retail wire products is from Newell Brands, Inc. through their Rubbermaid\u00ae product line. FirstService Brands, Inc. sells competing wood solutions under the brand California Closets\u00ae, but does not sell through the retail or direct to consumer channels.\nThe residential, industrial, and commercial fan industry is fragmented. CPP, under the highly recognized Hunter brand, sells through direct to consumer (e-commerce category), retail, and direct to installer (industrial and commercial) channels. CPP's principal competitors in the consumer ceiling fan market are retailer house brands such as Hampton Bay in The Home Depot and Harbor Breeze in Lowes, followed by Minka Air. In the industrial and commercial fan space, principal competitors are Big Ass Fans, Rite-Hite, Macro Air, and Minka Air.\nCPP differentiates itself and provides the best value to customers through its successful history of innovation, dependable supply chain and high on-time delivery rates, quality, product performance, and highly recognized product brands. CPP's size, depth and breadth of product offering, category knowledge, research and development (R&D) investment, service and its ability to react to sudden changes in demand from seasonal weather patterns, especially during harsh winter months, are competitive advantages. Offshore manufacturers lack sufficient product innovation, capacity, proximity to market and distribution capabilities to service large retailers or to efficiently and effectively compete in highly seasonal, weather related product categories.\nManufacturing and Distribution\nCPP has a combination of internal and external, and domestic and foreign, manufacturing sources from which it sources products for sale in the markets it serves. Principal North American manufacturing facilities include 644,000 square feet of manufacturing operations in Harrisburg and Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, a 676,000 square foot facility in Ocala, Florida, and a 353,000 square foot manufacturing center in St. Francois, Quebec, Canada. CPP operates smaller manufacturing facilities, including wood mills, at several other locations in the United States, and internationally in Jiangmen, China; and Grafton, New South Wales and Wonthaggi, Victoria, both in Australia.\nCPP has three principal distribution facilities in the United States, a 1.4 million square foot facility in Carlisle, Pennsylvania a 997,000 square foot facility in Reno, Nevada and a 600,000 square foot facility in Byhalia, MS. Finished goods are transported to these facilities from both North American manufacturing sites and from North American ports by both an internal fleet, as well as over the road trucking and rail. Additionally, light assembly is performed at the Carlisle and Reno locations. Smaller distribution centers are also strategically located in the U.S. in Ocala, Florida, and internationally in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and Ireland.\nHOME AND BUILDING PRODUCTS\nThe HBP segment consists of Clopay. Founded in 1964 and acquired by Griffon in 1986, Clopay has grown organically and through acquisitions to become the largest manufacturer and marketer of garage doors and rolling steel doors in North America. Clopay also manufactures a complete line of entry door systems uniquely designed to complement its popular residential garage door styles. The majority of Clopay's sales come from home remodeling and renovation projects, with the balance from commercial construction and new residential housing construction. Sales into the home remodeling market are driven by the aging of the housing stock, existing home sales activity, and the trends of improving both home appearance and energy efficiency. Sales into the commercial market are driven by the aging of nonresidential buildings, including warehouses, institutional and industrial facilities, increased business activity, changes to building codes, security of facilities and trends of improving function and performance.\nClopay has approximately 2,900 employees.\nBrands\nClopay brings over 50 years of experience and innovation to the residential and sectional garage door industry, and has over 100 years of experience in the rolling steel industry. Residential and commercial sectional products are sold under market-leading brands including Clopay\u00ae, Americas Favorite Garage Doors\u00ae, Holmes Garage Door Company\u00ae and IDEAL Door\u00ae. Clopay commercial rolling steel door brands include Cornell\u00ae, Cookson\u00ae and Clopay\u00ae.\nProducts and Service\nClopay manufactures a broad line of residential sectional garage doors with a variety of options, at varying prices. Clopay offers garage doors made primarily from steel, plastic composite and wood, and also sells related products, such as garage door openers manufactured by third parties. Clopay also offers a complete line of entry door systems uniquely designed to complement its popular residential garage door styles.\nCommercial door products manufactured and marketed by Clopay include rolling steel service doors, fire doors, shutters, steel security grilles, and room dividers. Clopay also manufactures and markets commercial sectional doors, which are similar to residential garage doors, but are designed to meet the more demanding performance specifications of a commercial application.\nCustomers\nClopay is currently the exclusive supplier of residential garage doors throughout North America to Home Depot and Menards. The loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on Clopay and Griffon. Clopay distributes its garage doors directly to customers from its manufacturing facilities and through its distribution centers located throughout the U.S. and Canada. These distribution centers allow Clopay to maintain an inventory of garage doors near installing dealers and provide quick-ship service to retail and professional dealer customers.\nProduct Development\nClopay product development efforts focus on both new products and improvements to existing products. Products are developed through in-house design and engineering staffs.\nClopay operates technical development centers where its research engineers design and develop new products and technologies and perform durability and performance testing of new and existing products, materials and finishes. Clopay continually improves its door offerings through these development efforts, focusing on characteristics such as strength, design, operating performance and durability, and energy efficiency. The process engineering teams also work to develop new manufacturing processes and production techniques aimed at improving manufacturing efficiencies and ensuring quality-made products.\nSales and Marketing\nThe Clopay sales and marketing organization supports our customers, consults on new product development and aggressively markets door solutions, with a primary focus on the North American market. Clopay maintains a strong promotional presence, in both traditional and digital media.\nClopay customers utilize a proprietary residential door web application, the MyDoor\u00ae mobile enabled app, that guides consumers through an easy to use visualization and pricing program, allowing them to select the optimal door for their home. For Clopay's commercial products, Clopay's Commercial Door Quoter (CDQ\u00ae\u2122) and CornellCookson's WebGen\u2122 systems are available to assist our professional dealers streamline their quoting and submittal process for greater productivity and back office efficiency improvement.\nRaw Materials and Suppliers\nThe principal raw material used in Clopay's manufacturing is galvanized steel. Clopay also utilizes certain hardware components, as well as wood and insulated foam. All raw materials are generally available from a number of sources.\nCompetition\nThe sectional garage door and commercial rolling steel door industry includes several large national manufacturers and many smaller, regional and local manufacturers. Clopay competes on the basis of service, quality, price, brand awareness and product design.\nClopay brand names are widely recognized in the building products industry. Clopay believes that it has earned a reputation among installing dealers and retailers for producing a broad range of innovative, high-quality doors with industry leading lead times. Clopay's market position and brand recognition are key marketing tools for expanding its customer base, leveraging its distribution network and increasing its market share.\nManufacturing and Distribution\nClopay's principal manufacturing facilities include 1,480,000 square feet in Troy and Russia, Ohio, 279,000 square feet in Mountain Top, Pennsylvania and 163,000 square feet in Goodyear, Arizona.\nClopay distributes its products through a wide range of distribution channels, including a national network of 52 distribution centers with a total of approximately 1,200,000 square feet. Additionally, products are sold to over 2,500 independent professional installing dealers and to major home center retail chains including Home Depot and Menards (with the average length of the relationship with these customers being greater than 25 years). Clopay maintains strong relationships with its installing dealers and believes it is the largest supplier of sectional garage doors to the retail and professional installing channels in North America and the largest supplier of rolling steel door products in North America. Clopay is currently the exclusive supplier of residential garage doors throughout North America to Home Depot and Menards.\nDiscontinued Operation:\nDEFENSE ELECTRONICS\nOn September 27, 2021, Griffon announced it was exploring strategic alternatives for its Defense Electronics segment, which consisted of Telephonics Corporation (\"Telephonics\"), and on June 27, 2022, Griffon completed the sale of Telephonics to TTM for $330,000, excluding certain customary post-closing adjustments, primarily related to working capital. Griffon classified the results of operations of the Telephonics business as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operation as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets. Accordingly, all references made to results and information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to Griffon's continuing operations unless noted otherwise.\nGriffon Corporation\nEmployees\nAs of September 30, 2022, Griffon and its subsidiaries employ approximately 6,200 employees located primarily throughout the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and China. Generally, the total number of employees of Griffon and its subsidiaries does not significantly fluctuate throughout the year. However, acquisition activity or the opening of new branches or lines of business, or other changes in the level of Griffon's business activity (for instance, based on actual or anticipated customer demand or other factors), could require staffing level adjustments.\nApproximately 70 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements in the U.S., with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union (an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations), and the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union. Additionally, approximately 200 employees in Canada are represented by the Trade Union Advisory Committee. Griffon believes its relationships with its employees are satisfactory.\nIn managing its human capital resources, Griffon aims to attract a qualified workforce through an inclusive and accessible recruiting process that utilizes online recruiting platforms, campus outreach, internships and job fairs. Griffon also seeks to retain employees by offering competitive wages, benefits and training opportunities, as well as promoting a safe and healthy workplace. Griffon and all of its businesses strictly comply with all applicable state, local and international laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which Griffon and its businesses have facilities. This applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including recruiting, hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leaves of absence, compensation and training. All applicants and employees are treated with the same high level of respect regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, marital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or protected veteran status.\nRegulation\nGriffons operations are subject to various environmental, health, and employee safety laws and regulations. Griffon believes that it is in material compliance with these laws and regulations. Historically, compliance with environmental, health, and employee safety laws and regulations have not materially affected, and are not expected to materially affect, Griffons capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Nevertheless, Griffon cannot guarantee that, in the future, it will not incur additional costs for compliance or that such costs will not be material.\nCustomers\nA small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffons consolidated revenue. In 2022, Home Depot represented 13% of Griffons consolidated revenue, 19% of CPP's revenue and 7% of HBP's revenue.\nNo other customer accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenue. Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffons largest customers and Griffon's relationships with them. Orders from these customers are subject to change and may fluctuate materially. The loss of all or a portion of volume from any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on Griffons financial results, liquidity and operations.\nSeasonality\nGriffon's revenue and earnings are generally lowest in our first and fourth quarters ending December 31, and September 30, respectively, and highest in the second and third quarters ending March 31, and June 30, respectively, primarily due to the seasonality within the CPP and HBP businesses. In 2022, with the addition of Hunter Fan, 58% (55%, excluding Hunter Fan sales) of CPP's' sales occurred during the second and third quarters compared to 53% in both 2021 and 2020. HBPs business is driven by renovation and construction during warm weather, which is historically at reduced levels during the winter months, generally in our second quarter.\nDemand for lawn and garden products is influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather during peak gardening season. AMES' sales volume can be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, hurricanes, water shortages or floods. In addition, lack of snow or lower than average snowfall during the winter season may result in reduced sales of certain AMES' products, such as snow shovels and other snow tools. As a result, AMES' results of operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nFinancial Information About Geographic Areas\nSegment and operating results are included in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nFor geographic financial information, see the Reportable Segment footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nGriffons non-U.S. businesses are primarily in Canada, Australia, the U.K., Ireland and China.\nResearch and Development\nGriffons businesses are encouraged to improve existing products as well as develop new products to satisfy customer needs; expand revenue opportunities; maintain or extend competitive advantages; increase market share and reduce production costs. R&D costs, not recoverable under contractual arrangements, are charged to expense as incurred.\nIntellectual Property\nGriffon follows a practice of actively protecting and enforcing its proprietary rights in the U.S. and throughout the world where Griffons products are sold. All intellectual property information presented in this section is as of September 30, 2022.\nTrademarks are of significant importance to Griffons HBP and CPP businesses. With 50 years of experience and innovation in the garage door industry, and over 100 years of experience in the rolling steel door industry, HBP has a significant level of goodwill in its strong family of brands, including: Clopay\u00ae, Americas Favorite Doors\u00ae; Holmes Garage Door Company\u00ae; IDEAL Door\u00ae; and the Cornell\u00ae and Cookson\u00ae commercial door brands. Principal global and regional trademarks used by CPP for its tool and landscape products include AMES\u00ae, True Temper\u00ae, Garant\u00ae, Harper\u00ae, UnionTools\u00ae, Westmix\u2122, Cyclone\u00ae, Southern Patio\u00ae, Northcote Pottery\u2122, Nylex\u00ae, Hills\u00ae, Kelkay\u00ae, Tuscan Path\u00ae, La Hacienda\u00ae, Kelso\u2122, Apta\u00ae, and Dynamic Design\u00ae, as well as contractor-oriented brands including Razor-Back\u00ae Professional Tools and Jackson\u00ae Professional Tools. Storage and home organization brands within CPP include ClosetMaid\u00ae, MasterSuite\u00ae, Suite Symphony\u00ae, Cubeicals\u00ae, ExpressShelf\u00ae, SpaceCreations\u00ae, Maximum Load\u00ae, SuperSlide\u00ae and ShelfTrack\u00ae. CPPs Hunter Fan Company has over 135 years of experience in the ceiling fan industry with well-recognized brands including Hunter\u00ae, Casablanca\u00ae, Hunter Industrial\u00ae, and Jan Fan\u00ae. The HBP and CPP businesses have approximately 1,671 registered trademarks and approximately 174 pending trademark applications around the world. Griffons rights in these trademarks endure for as long as they are used and registered.\nPatents are also important to the HBP and CPP businesses. HBP holds approximately 45 issued patents and 23 pending patent applications in the U.S., as well as approximately 19 and 46 corresponding foreign patents and patent applications, primarily related to garage door system components and operation. CPP protects its designs and product innovation through the use of patents, and currently has approximately 723 issued patents and approximately 211 pending patent applications in the U.S., as well as approximately 310 and 107 corresponding foreign patents and patent applications, respectively. Design patents are generally valid for fourteen years, and utility patents are generally valid for twenty years, from the date of filing. Griffon's patents are in various stages of their terms of validity.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance\nGriffon and its operating companies have always taken into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations in the management of our businesses. Griffon is a subscriber to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and published its inaugural annual ESG report, in relation to fiscal 2021, benchmarked to both UNGC Sustainable Development Goals and to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board criteria. The Griffon ESG policy and fiscal 2021 ESG Report can be found on the Griffon website at www.griffon.com.\nThe fiscal 2021 ESG Report discusses community involvement, charitable giving, employee safety, employee education and welfare, energy consumption, water consumption, waste generated, recycled raw materials, and packaging initiatives. We are preparing to set ESG goals in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 based on the metrics gathered in fiscal 2021, which process continued through 2022, and will continue through fiscal 2023.\nGriffon has assessed the environmental risk from its operations and has focused its efforts to date on areas with the potential to have the greatest environmental impact. Where available, we use recycled materials to construct our products, and we continuously improve our packaging to reduce both volume and environmental impact. For example, bags used for AMES Kelkay aggregate products in the UK are made from plant-based materials, and not from petroleum. Seventy percent of the steel used in HBP's garage doors is recycled steel. AMES is a member of the Appalachian Hardwood Manufacturers Association, which provides sustainable hardwoods for AMES tools, and is committed to purchasing hardwoods through the Sustainable Forestry Initiative.\nGriffon continues its efforts to reduce carbon emissions by reducing electricity and natural gas usage at its operating facilities. Our Clopay business helps its customers reduce their own carbon footprints by providing garage doors that meet LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) building construction standards. While Griffons facilities are not large consumers of water, we routinely examine options to reduce water usage or reuse water at our facilities. AMES used recycled AMES and ClosetMaid tools and scrap materials in the construction of the new AMES headquarters facility in the Orlando, Florida area. Over the years, Griffon operating companies have reduced the use of solvents and other chemicals and now rarely generate hazardous waste of any kind.\nOur operating companies are involved in the local communities in which they operate. We are involved in more than 100 charitable and community organizations, including well known national concerns such as Habitat for Humanity, Boys and Girls Clubs, the Home Depot Foundation (Diamond Sponsor) and the American Cancer Society, as well as local groups such as garden clubs. For example, employees at our Clopay subsidiary built a new home for Habitat for Humanity, and AMES contributed tools and products to that effort. Our communities know that they can count on us in a crisis.\nOver the last five years, we have invested millions of dollars in capital improvements relating to energy consumption and to employee safety and health. These improvements include lighting energy efficiency projects saving in excess of 1.5 million kilowatt-hours, major upgrades to our loading and unloading operations (which had been the source of a significant portion of our worker injuries), ergonomic improvements, machine guarding and elimination of certain high-risk repetitive jobs through use of robotics. Griffon has also invested significant time and capital reducing ergonomic injuries through better work positioning and lifting improvements. Griffon has also invested over one million dollars in improvements to employee welfare facilities, such as break areas and cafeterias. We view our employees as more than just workers. Through our Employee Stock Ownership Plan, our U.S. employees own approximately nine percent of Griffon stock. Our businesses engage in a variety of outreach programs in the various communities in which we operate to recruit new employees at all levels. These programs involve high schools and vocational schools, as well as colleges and universities, and often include internships as a means for potential new employees to experience what it is like to be part of our team. We also have a variety of onboarding programs, onsite job training programs, leadership development programs, and tuition reimbursement and education assistance policies to further the development and advancement of our employees.\nIn all of our geographies, we use on-site inspections and specific contractual terms to manage our supply chains to ensure compliance with environmental and social laws and regulations, as well as our policies in these areas, including with respect to human rights, child labor, slave labor and unsafe working conditions. All significant CPP suppliers worldwide must periodically submit to a Factory Compliance and Capacity Assessment, which evaluates not only quality control and vendor capabilities, but assesses to what extent each supplier emphasizes environmental, labor and social considerations in the operation of its business. These activities have continued despite the travel difficulties caused by COVID. In China, where CPP both operates a manufacturing facility and sources materials and products from third parties, CPP has dedicated compliance personnel who report directly into CPP General Counsels.\nHonesty, transparency, and ethical practices have been ordinary course at Griffon for decades, and we continue to review and upgrade our programs in these areas. Our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (\"Code\"), to which every employee certifies annually, requires that each and every employee conduct business to the highest ethical standards. Any acts of bribery are strictly prohibited, as is human trafficking and activities supporting human trafficking, such as the use of conflicts minerals. The Code prohibits all business courtesies except for those with an insignificant value, and even then, only under limited circumstances. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines are published on our website. While the guidelines require that a majority of directors be independent, currently all of our directors are independent except our CEO (constituting over 92% of our directors). Griffon has appointed a lead independent director and has four principal board committees - Audit, Compensation,\nNominating and Corporate Governance, and Finance - each of which has its responsibilities set forth in a charter available on the Griffon website.\nWe expect each of our employees around the world to work hard to deliver outstanding products to our customers and to deliver value to our shareholders. And, while doing so, we expect them to respect and adhere to our environmental, social and governance commitments and policies, and to make our company a place at which all employees are proud to come to work every day.\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant\nThe following is a current list of Griffons executive officers:\nName Age Positions Held and Prior Business Experience\nRonald J.

Risk Factors\nGriffons business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause Griffons actual results to vary materially from recent or anticipated future results. The risk factors discussed in this section should be carefully considered with all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors should not be considered the only risk factors facing Griffon. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also materially impact Griffons business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows in the future.\nIn general, Griffon is subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact other diverse manufacturing companies including, but not limited to, general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; impact of natural disasters and pandemics, and their effect on global markets; possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Griffon has identified the following specific risks and uncertainties that it believes have the potential to materially affect its business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nCurrent worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could adversely affect Griffons businesses.\nThe current worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could continue to have an adverse effect on Griffon during 2023, within both the CPP and HBP segments, which are linked to the U.S. housing and the commercial property markets, and the U.S. economy in general. Purchases of many CPP and HBP products are discretionary for consumers who are generally more willing to purchase products during periods in which favorable macroeconomic conditions prevail. These conditions could make it more difficult to obtain additional credit on favorable terms for investments in current businesses or for acquisitions, or could render financing unavailable; in addition, while we do not have any near term debt maturities, if these conditions persist, we may have difficulty refinancing our debt when it comes due. Griffon is also exposed to certain fundamental economic risks including a decrease in the demand for the products and services it offers or a higher likelihood of default on its receivables.\nAdverse trends and general economic conditions, especially those that relate to construction and renovation, will impact Griffons business.\nThe CPP and HBP businesses serve residential and commercial construction and renovation, and are influenced by market conditions that affect these industries. For the year ended September 30, 2022, approximately 47% and 53% of Griffons consolidated revenue was derived from the CPP and HBP segments, respectively, which were dependent on renovation of existing homes, new home construction, and commercial non-residential construction, repair and replacement. The strength of the U.S. economy, the age of existing home stock, job growth, interest rates, consumer confidence and the availability of consumer credit, as well as demographic factors such as migration into the U.S. and migration of the population within the U.S., have an effect on CPP and HBP. To the extent market conditions for residential or commercial construction and renovation are weaker than expected, this will likely have an adverse impact on the performance and financial results of the CPP and HBP businesses.\nGriffon is exposed to fluctuations in inflation, which could negatively affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInflation rates, including residential mortgage rates, particularly in the United States, have increased recently to historic levels. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the annual inflation rate for the United States was approximately 8.2% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. Continued high inflation or increases in inflation may result in decreased demand for Griffons products and services and increased operating costs and expenses, including labor costs and costs of raw materials and supplies. In particular, higher home mortgage rates typically result in a slowdown in both the purchase and construction of new homes and renovation of existing homes, which will reduce demand for certain of Griffons products. In addition, the United States Federal Reserve has raised, and may again raise, interest rates in response to concerns about inflation. Increases in interest rates, especially if coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets, may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks, which may result in economic recession. In the event inflation continues to increase, we may seek to increase the sales prices of our products and services in order to maintain satisfactory margins. Any attempts to offset Griffons cost increases with price increases may result in reduced sales, increase customer dissatisfaction or harm to reputation. Additionally, Griffons operating companies may be unable to raise the prices of their products and services at or above the rate at which their costs increase, which may reduce revenues and operating margins and have a material adverse effect on financial results and future growth.\nGriffon operates in highly competitive industries and may be unable to compete effectively.\nGriffons operating companies face intense competition in the markets they serve. Griffon competes primarily on the basis of technical expertise, product differentiation, quality of products and services, and price. There are a number of competitors to Griffon, some of which are larger and have greater resources than Griffons operating companies. Griffon's operating companies may face additional competition from companies that operate in countries with significantly lower operating costs.\nMany CPP and HBP customers are large mass merchandisers, such as home centers, warehouse clubs, discount stores, commercial distributors and e-commerce companies. The growing share of the market represented by these large mass merchandisers, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have contributed to the increase of multi-category retailers and e-commerce companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers. Many of these retailers import products directly from foreign suppliers to source and sell products under their own private label brands to compete with CPP and HBP products and brands, which puts increasing price pressure on the products of these businesses. In addition, the intense\ncompetition in the retail and e-commerce sectors, combined with the overall increasingly competitive economic environment, may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty, or failing in the future. The loss of, or a failure by, one of CPPs or HBPs significant customers could adversely impact our sales and operating cash flows.\nTo address all of these challenges, CPP and HBP must be able to respond to these competitive pressures, and the failure to respond effectively could result in a loss of sales, reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases. In addition, there can be no assurance that Griffon will not encounter increased competition in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on Griffons financial results.\nThe loss of large customers can harm financial results.\nA small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon's consolidated revenue. Home Depot, Lowes and Bunnings are significant customers of CPP, and Home Depot and Menards are significant customers of HBP. Home Depot accounted for approximately 13% of consolidated revenue, 19% of CPP's revenue and 7% of HBP's revenue for the year ended September 30, 2022. Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffons largest customers, as well as Griffons relationships with them. Orders from these customers are subject to fluctuation and may be reduced materially due to changes in customer needs or other factors. Any reduction or delay in sales of products to one or more of these customers could significantly reduce Griffons revenue. Griffons operating results will also depend on successfully developing relationships with additional key customers. Griffon cannot assure that its largest customers will be retained or that additional key customers will be recruited. Also, both CPP and HBP extend credit to its customers, which exposes it to credit risk. The largest customer accounted for approximately 26%, 7% and 17% of the net accounts receivable of CPP, HBP and Griffon as of September 30, 2022, respectively. If this customer were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay its debts, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of CPP, HBP and Griffon could be adversely affected.\nReliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may impair the ability of CPP and HBP to meet their customer demands.\nCPP and HBP rely on a limited number of domestic and foreign companies to supply components and manufacture certain of their products. The percentage of CPP and HBP worldwide sourced finished goods as a percent of revenue approximated 34% and 5%, respectively, in 2022. The percentage of CPP and HBP's worldwide sourced components as a percent of cost of goods sold approximated 13% and 14%, respectively, in 2022. Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may reduce control over the timing of deliveries and quality of both CPP and HBP products. Reduced product quality or failure to deliver products timely may jeopardize relationships with certain of CPP's and HBP's key customers. In addition, reliance on third party suppliers or manufacturers may result in the failure to meet CPP and HBP customer demands. Continued turbulence in the worldwide economy may affect the liquidity and financial condition of CPP and HBP suppliers. Should any of these parties fail to manufacture sufficient supply, go out of business or discontinue a particular component, alternative suppliers may not be found in a timely manner, if at all. Such events may impact the ability of CPP and HBP to fill orders, which could have a material adverse effect on customer relationships.\nA product provided to HBP by one of its suppliers was found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of a competitor of this supplier. The supplier developed an alternative design for such product that has allowed it to meet HBPs needs and which the supplier believes is non-infringing; however, the competitor has alleged, in a pending administrative proceeding, that the redesigned product also infringes on its intellectual property rights. The supplier is also appealing the initial finding of infringement and believes it has a reasonable likelihood of success. However, should the alternative design be deemed to be an infringing product and should the supplier lose its appeal of the initial finding of infringement, and as a result the supply of this product is interrupted, it could adversely impact HBPs business and results of operations.\nIf Griffon is unable to obtain raw materials for products at favorable prices it could adversely impact operating performance.\nCPP and HBP suppliers primarily provide resin, wood, steel and wire rod. Both of these businesses could experience shortages of raw materials or components for products or be forced to seek alternative sources of supply. If temporary shortages due to disruptions in supply caused by weather, transportation, production delays or other factors require raw materials to be secured from sources other than current suppliers, the terms may not be as favorable as current terms or certain materials may not be available at all. In recent years, both CPP and HBP have experienced price increases for most of their raw materials.\nWhile most key raw materials used in Griffons businesses are generally available from numerous sources, raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. Because raw materials in the aggregate constitute a significant component of the cost of goods sold, price fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on Griffons results of operations. Griffons ability to pass raw material price increases to customers is limited due to supply arrangements and competitive pricing pressure, and there is\ngenerally a time lag between increased raw material costs and implementation of corresponding price increases for Griffons products. In particular, sharp increases in raw material prices are more difficult to pass through to customers and may negatively affect short-term financial performance.\nCPP is subject to risks from sourcing from international locations, especially China\nCPP's business is global, with products and raw materials sourced from, manufactured in and sold in multiple countries around the world. There are risks associated with conducting a business that may be impacted by political and other developments associated with international trade. In this regard, certain products sold by CPP in the United States and elsewhere are currently sourced from suppliers in China, with some of these products sourced exclusively from suppliers in China. Certain raw materials used by CPP may be sourced from China and therefore may have their prices and availability impacted by tariffs imposed on trade between the United States and China.\nThe sourcing of CPP finished goods, components and raw materials from China are generally subject to supply agreements with Chinese companies. China does not have a well-developed, consolidated body of laws governing agreements with international customers. Enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic, and it may be difficult to obtain swift and equitable enforcement or to obtain enforcement of a judgment by a court of another jurisdiction. The relative limited Chinese judicial precedent on matters of international trade in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation. In addition, interpretation of statutes and regulations in China may be subject to government policies or political changes.\nBecause of the volume of sourcing by CPP from China, the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China, including the imposition of tariffs on various Chinese imports into the U.S. at various times since March 2018, represents a continuing risk to CPP revenue and operating performance. The tariffs currently apply to approximately $375 billion in annual U.S. imports from China. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 requires that the duties must terminate after four years unless one or more domestic beneficiaries of the tariffs requests their continuation. In September 2022, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) announced that it had received such requests and would therefore continue the tariffs pending a comprehensive review of their necessity. The process for completing this review, which contemplates a period of public comment, means the tariffs will remain in effect for several months at least, with an unpredictable outcome.\nIn addition to tariffs, an increased global focus on forced labor in supply chains has the potential to impact our business operations. In June 2022, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) went into effect and establishes a rebuttable presumption that goods made in whole or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the Peoples Republic of China are produced with forced labor, and directs US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to prevent entry of products made with forced labor into the U.S. market. Importers whose shipments are detained by CBP under the UFLPA can rebut the presumption with clear and convincing evidence that the products were not produced with forced labor. This requires that the importer submit detailed information regarding every supplier and sub-supplier, as well as all components and raw materials, relating to the goods being detained, and detention costs accrue during the pendency of CBPs evaluation. From June 21, 2022 through September 30, 2022, more than 1,450 shipments from China to U.S importers, valued at approximately $429 million, were targeted by CBP for further inspection. Neither CPP nor its suppliers currently manufacture or source products, components or raw materials from the Uyghur region of China; however, CBP takes a broad approach when targeting shipments they believe may have originated from the Uyghur region based on product definitions, tariff codes and supplier names that lead them to suspect the goods come from the Uyghur region. As a result, CPP shipments may be targeted for detention in which case they become subject to the rebuttable presumption that they were sourced from the Uyghur region even though they are demonstrably outside the scope of the UFLPA. In view of the increased enforcement of forced labor initiatives, we are updating our compliance measures and working with our China supply base to validate their supply chains, from raw materials through components to finished goods, to ensure our goods are not made using forced labor. We cannot be certain that our products will not be targeted or that our shipments will not be detained, which may impact our operating performance. Forced labor enforcement initiatives are targeting imports from other countries besides China, and we are monitoring the products and countries subject to increased scrutiny for potential impacts to our operations.\nThe continuing political and economic conflicts between U.S. and China have resulted in and may continue to cause retaliatory policies from both countries, and it is unknown whether current US-China relations over Taiwan, including the commencement of negotiations regarding a new trade initiative between the United States and Taiwan, will impact the ongoing trade dispute with China. We cannot predict what new and additional retaliatory policies and regulations may be implemented by the Chinese government in response to the U.S./Taiwan engagement, and any such policies and regulations or other responses may adversely affect our business operations in China.\nCPP and HBP operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and the activities and regulations of the World Trade Organization. Although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization, sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties and/or quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country, trade agreements can also adversely affect CPP and HBP businesses. For example, trade agreements can result in setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K., or may make it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where CPP and HBP competitors source products.\nThe ability of CPP and HBP to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may continue to be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the U.S. and other countries, as well as the potential for increased costs due to currency exchange fluctuations. These issues could delay importation of products or require CPP and HBP to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on CPP and HBP business and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak, or any other future pandemic could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe future impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, or any other future pandemic, and the spread of the pathogen on a global basis could adversely affect our businesses in a number of respects, although the extent, nature and timing of such impact cannot be predicted as of the date of this filing. The COVID-19 outbreak led countries around the world, as well as most states in the U.S., to implement restrictions from time-to-time relating to the operation of almost all types of businesses. Most of these restrictions have been eliminated or reduced due to a reduction in the health risk of COVID-19. As of the date of this filing, all of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are operating. However, government actions taken based on the changing nature of the outbreak in the U.S. or in other countries in which we do business could result in temporary closures of Griffon facilities.\nDuring the height of COVID-19 our supply chain experienced certain disruptions which, together with other factors such as a shortage of labor, resulted in longer delivery lead times and restricted manufacturing capacity for certain of our products. While our supply chain appears to generally be stable at this time, should a resurgence of COVID-19 occur, our supply chain could again be negatively impacted; for example, certain of our suppliers could be required by government authorities to temporarily cease operations or might be limited in their production capacity.\nIf as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, including a potential resurgence of the virus in the fall and winter months, governments take additional protective actions, it may have a material adverse impact on Griffons businesses and operating results for the reasons described above. In such event, the extent and duration of any impact on our businesses would be difficult to predict. To the extent the COVID-19 outbreak adversely affects our businesses, operations, financial condition and operating results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks factors such as those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness, as described in more detail below.\nGriffons businesses are subject to seasonal variations and the impact of uncertain weather patterns.\nGriffon's revenue and earnings are generally lowest in our first and fourth quarters ending December 31, and September 30, respectively, and highest in the second and third quarters ending March 31, and June 30, respectively, primarily due to the seasonality within the AMES and HBP businesses. In 2022, with the addition of Hunter Fan, 58% (55%, excluding Hunter Fan sales) of AMES' sales occurred during the second and third quarters compared to 53% in both 2021 and 2020. HBPs business is driven by renovation and construction during warm weather, which is generally at reduced levels during the winter months, generally in our second quarter.\nDemand for lawn and garden products is influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season. AMES' sales volumes could be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, hurricanes, water shortages or floods. In addition, lack of snow or lower than average snowfall during the winter season may result in reduced sales of certain AMES' products such as snow shovels and other snow tools. As a result, AMES' results of operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nUnionized employees could strike or participate in a work stoppage.\nAt September 30, 2022, Griffon employed approximately 6,200 people on a full-time basis, approximately 4% of whom are covered by collective bargaining or similar labor agreements. If unionized employees engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or if Griffon is unable to negotiate acceptable extensions of agreements with labor unions, a significant disruption of operations and increased operating costs could occur. In addition, any renegotiation or renewal of labor agreements could result in higher wages or benefits paid to unionized employees, which could increase operating costs and as a result have a material adverse effect on profitability.\nGriffons operations and reputation may be adversely impacted if our information technology (IT) systems, or the IT systems of third parties with whom we do business, fail to perform adequately or if we or such third parties are the subject of a data breach or cyber-attack.\nWe rely on IT systems, networks and services to conduct our business, including communicating with employees and our key commercial customers, ordering and managing materials and products from suppliers, shipping products to customers and analyzing and reporting results of operations. While we have taken steps to ensure the security of our information technology systems, our systems may nevertheless be vulnerable to computer viruses, security breaches and other disruptions from unauthorized users. Cyber criminals are becoming more sophisticated and knowledgeable every day, and as their tactics evolve, it is a constant challenge to ensure that our IT security practices are sufficient to protect our IT systems and data. If our IT systems are damaged or cease to function properly for an extended period of time, whether as a result of a significant cyber incident or otherwise, our ability to communicate internally as well as with our customers and suppliers could be significantly impaired, which may adversely impact our business, operations and reputation.\nIn the normal course of our business, we collect, store, and transmit proprietary and confidential information regarding our brands, customers, employees, suppliers and others. We also engage third parties that store, process and transmit these types of information, as well as personal information, on our behalf. An operational failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to loss, misuse or unauthorized disclosure of this information about our employees or customers, which may result in regulatory or other legal proceedings, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. We also may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Any such attacks or precautionary measures taken to prevent anticipated attacks may result in increasing costs, including costs for additional technologies, training, and third-party consultants. The losses incurred from a breach of data security and operational failures as well as the precautionary measures required to address this evolving risk may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on our information systems to process orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, purchase, sell, and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations, and provide superior service to our customers. If these systems are damaged, infiltrated, shutdown, or cease to function properly (whether by planned upgrades, force majeure, telecommunications failures, hardware or software break-ins or viruses, other cyber security incidents, or otherwise), we may suffer disruption in our ability to manage and operate our business.\nThere can be no assurance that the precautions which we have taken against certain events that could disrupt the operations of our information systems will prevent the occurrence of such a disruption. Any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nGriffon may be unable to implement its acquisition growth strategy, which may result in added expenses without a commensurate increase in revenue and income, and divert managements attention.\nMaking strategic acquisitions is a significant part of Griffons growth plans. The ability to successfully complete acquisitions depends on identifying and acquiring, on acceptable terms, companies that either complement or enhance currently held businesses or expand Griffon into new profitable businesses, and, for certain acquisitions, obtaining financing on acceptable terms. Additionally, Griffon must properly integrate acquired businesses in order to maximize profitability. The competition for acquisition candidates is intense and Griffon cannot assure that it will successfully identify acquisition candidates and complete acquisitions at reasonable purchase prices, in a timely manner, or at all. Further, there is a risk that acquisitions will not be properly integrated into Griffons existing structure. Griffon closed the acquisitions of La Hacienda, Tuscan Path, ClosetMaid and Harper Brush in the months of July through November 2017, Kelkay in February 2018, CornellCookson in June 2018, Apta in November 2019, Quatro in December 2020 and Hunter Fan in January 2022. This integration risk may be exacerbated when numerous acquisitions are consummated in a short time period.\nIn implementing an acquisition growth strategy, the following may be encountered:\nCosts associated with incomplete or poorly implemented acquisitions;\nExpenses, delays and difficulties of integrating acquired companies into Griffons existing organization;\nDilution of the interest of existing stockholders;\nDiversion of managements attention; or\nDifficulty in obtaining financing on acceptable terms, or at all.\nAn unsuccessful implementation of Griffons acquisition growth strategy, including the failure to properly integrate acquisitions, could have an adverse impact on Griffons results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions, which could impose restrictions on our business operations and harm our operating results.\nThe pendency of our current process to explore strategic alternatives and the possible failure to consummate a strategic transaction could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our future business and results of operations.\nIn May 2022, Griffons Board of Directors publicly announced that it would explore a comprehensive range of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value including a sale, merger, divestiture, recapitalization or other strategic transaction. This process is active and ongoing. The uncertainties associated with this process, and the expenses and efforts involved, may negatively affect our business and our relationships with employees, customers, suppliers, distributors and vendors. If we do not enter into or consummate a strategic transaction, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if we do not consummate a transaction, the price of our common stock may decline from the current market price, as the current market price might incorporate a market assumption that a transaction will be consummated. A failed transaction may also result in reduced employee morale and productivity, negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community. Further, any disruptions to our business resulting from any announcement and pendency of a transaction, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, suppliers, distributors, vendors and employees or recruiting and retention efforts, could continue or accelerate in the event of a failed acquisition. Matters relating to any failed transaction may require significant costs and expenses and substantial management time and resources, which could otherwise have been devoted to operating and growing our businesses.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWhile Griffons senior notes, which have limited covenants, are not due until 2028; its $800 million Term Loan B (current balance of $496 million), which also has limited covenants, is not due until 2029; and its $400 million revolving line of credit, which has greater covenant requirements, does not mature until 2025, there are potential impacts from Griffons use of debt to finance certain of its activities, especially acquisitions and expansions, as set forth below.\nCompliance with restrictions and covenants in Griffons debt agreements may limit its ability to take corporate actions.\nThe credit agreement entered into by, and, to a lesser extent, the terms of the senior notes issued by, Griffon each contain covenants that restrict the ability of Griffon and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional debt, pay dividends, incur liens and make investments, acquisitions, dispositions, restricted payments and capital expenditures. Under the credit agreement, Griffon is also required to comply with specific financial ratios and tests. Griffon may not be able to comply in the future with these covenants or restrictions as a result of events beyond its control, such as prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions or a change in control of Griffon. If Griffon defaults in maintaining compliance with the covenants and restrictions in its credit agreement or the senior notes, its lenders could declare all of the principal and interest amounts outstanding due and payable and, in the case of the credit agreement, terminate the commitments to extend credit to Griffon in the future. If Griffon or its subsidiaries are unable to secure credit in the future, its business could be harmed.\nGriffon may be unable to raise additional financing if needed.\nGriffon may need to raise additional financing in the future in order to implement its business plan, refinance debt, or acquire new or complimentary businesses or assets. Any required additional financing may be unavailable, or only available at unfavorable terms, due to uncertainties in the credit markets. If Griffon raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, current holders of its common stock may experience significant ownership interest dilution and the holders of the new securities may have rights senior to the rights associated with current outstanding common stock.\nGriffons indebtedness and interest expense could limit cash flow and adversely affect operations and Griffons ability to make full payment on outstanding debt.\nGriffons indebtedness poses potential risks such as:\nA substantial portion of cash flows from operations could be used to pay principal and interest on debt, thereby reducing the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development and other general corporate purposes;\nInsufficient cash flows from operations may force Griffon to sell assets, or seek additional capital, which Griffon may not be able to secure on favorable terms, if at all; and\nIts level of indebtedness may make Griffon more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns.\nRisk Related to Our Common Stock\nGriffon has the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of issued and outstanding common stock.\nThe issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution to existing stockholders equity interests. Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder vote or approval, 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and has the ability to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any such series. Any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of Griffons common stock. While there is no present intention of issuing any such preferred stock, Griffon reserves the right to do so at any time. In addition, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 85,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 57,064,331 shares, net of treasury shares, were outstanding as of September 30, 2022. Additionally, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, securities convertible into either shares of common stock or preferred stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nEach of Griffon's businesses faces risks related to the disruption of its primary manufacturing facilities.\nThe manufacturing facilities for each of Griffon's businesses are concentrated in just a few locations, and in the case of CPP, some of these locations are abroad in low-cost locations. Any of Griffon's manufacturing facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, such as natural or man-made disasters, pandemics, terrorist activities, disruptions of information technology resources, and utility interruptions. Such disruptions may cause delays in shipping products, which could result in the loss of business or customer trust, adversely affecting Griffons businesses and operating results.\nManufacturing capacity constraints or increased manufacturing costs may have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nGriffons current manufacturing resources may be inadequate to meet significantly increased demand for some of its products. Griffons ability to increase its manufacturing capacity depends on many factors, including the availability of capital, steadily increasing consumer demand, equipment delivery, construction lead-times, installation, qualification, and permitting and other regulatory requirements. Increasing capacity through the use of third-party manufacturers may depend on Griffons ability to develop and maintain such relationships and the ability of such third parties to devote additional capacity to fill its orders.\nA lack of sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand could cause customer service levels to decrease, which may negatively affect customer demand for Griffon's products and customer relations generally, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, operating facilities at or near capacity may also increase production and distribution costs and negatively impact relations with employees or contractors, which could result in disruptions to operations.\nIn addition, manufacturing costs may increase significantly and Griffon may not be able to pass along all or any of such increase to its customers; and when such increases are passed off to customers, there will be a time lag, which may be significant.\nIf CPP and HBP do not continue to develop and maintain leading brands or realize the anticipated benefits of advertising and promotion spend, its operating results may suffer.\nThe ability of CPP and HBP to compete successfully depends in part on the companys ability to develop and maintain leading brands so that retail and other customers will need its products to meet consumer demand. Leading brands allow both CPP and HBP to realize economies of scale in its operations. The development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brand-building and marketing initiatives. While CPP and HBP plan to continue to increase its expenditures for advertising and promotion and other brand-building and marketing initiatives over the long term, the initiatives may not deliver the anticipated results and the results of such initiatives may not cover the costs of the increased investment.\nGriffon may be required to record impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nGriffon is required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment or on an interim basis if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists. If impairment testing indicates that the carrying amount of reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the respective fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized. If goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets were to become impaired, the results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax goodwill impairment of $342,027, and a non-cash pre-tax indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment of $175,000. These non-cash impairments resulted in an aggregate decrease of $8.43 in our earnings per share for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Should we have to record additional impairment charges in the future, it could similarly have a significant negative impact on our earnings per share for the year in which any such impairment charge is recorded.\nIf Griffon's subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their obligations, Griffon's performance and ability to win future business could be harmed.\nGriffon relies on other companies to provide materials, major components and products to fulfill contractual obligations. Such arrangements may involve subcontracts, teaming arrangements, or supply agreements with other companies. There is a risk that Griffon may have disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed. In addition, changes in the economic environment, including constraints on available financing, may adversely affect the financial stability of Griffon's supply chain and their ability to meet their performance requirements or to provide needed supplies on a timely basis. A disruption or failure of any supplier could have an adverse effect on Griffon's business resulting in an impact to profitability, possible termination of a contract, imposition of fines or penalties, and harm to Griffon's reputation impacting its ability to secure future business.\nGriffons companies must continually improve existing products, design and sell new products and invest in research and development in order to compete effectively.\nThe markets for Griffons products are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products. Due to constant changes in Griffon's markets, future success depends on Griffon's ability to develop new technologies, products, processes and product applications. Griffon's long-term success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that are appealing to ultimate end users and create demand. New product development and commercialization efforts, including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which Griffon has limited or no prior experience, have inherent risks. These risks include the costs involved, such as development and commercialization, product development or launch delays, and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance or growth in sales or operating income.\nGriffon also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with Griffons products. In addition, sales generated by new products could cause a decline in sales of Griffons other existing products. If new product development and commercialization efforts are not successful, Griffons financial results could be adversely affected.\nProduct and technological developments are accomplished both through internally-funded R&D projects, as well as through strategic partnerships with customers. Because it is not generally possible to predict the amount of time required and costs involved in achieving certain R&D objectives, actual development costs may exceed budgeted amounts and estimated product development schedules may be extended. Griffons financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if:\nProduct improvements are not completed on a timely basis;\nNew products are not introduced on a timely basis or do not achieve sufficient market penetration;\nThere are budget overruns or delays in R&D efforts; or\nNew products experience reliability or quality problems, or otherwise do not meet customer preferences or requirements.\nThe loss of certain key officers or employees could adversely affect Griffons business.\nThe success of Griffon is materially dependent upon the continued services of certain key officers and employees. The loss of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on Griffons operating results or financial condition.\nGriffon is exposed to a variety of risks relating to non-U.S. sales and operations, including non-U.S. economic and political conditions and fluctuations in exchange rates.\nGriffon and its companies conduct operations in Canada, Australasia, the U.K., and China, and sell their products in many countries around the world. Sales of products through non-U.S. subsidiaries accounted for approximately 17% of consolidated revenue for the year ended September 30, 2022. These sales could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, such as tariffs, the ability of the Company to enter into industrial cooperation agreements (offset agreements), differing intellectual property rights and laws and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs in such locations. Enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdictions can be uncertain, and the lack of a sophisticated body of laws can create various uncertainties, including with respect to customer and supplier contracts. Currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in the non-U.S. regions in which Griffon does business may also have an impact on future reported financial results.\nGriffon's international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect operations. Griffon is subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, Griffon is subject to certain export controls, laws and regulations, as well as to economic sanctions, laws and embargoes imposed by various governments or organizations, including the U.S. and the European Union or member countries. Violations of anti-corruption, export controls or sanctions laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, including loss of export privileges and loss of authorizations needed to conduct Griffon's international business. Such violations could also result in Griffon being subject to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGriffon may not be able to protect its proprietary rights.\nGriffon relies on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, common law, trade secrets, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to protect proprietary rights. Such measures do not provide absolute protection and Griffon cannot give assurance that measures for protecting these proprietary rights are and will be adequate, or that competitors will not independently develop similar technologies.\nGriffon or its suppliers may inadvertently infringe on, or may be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights of others.\nGriffon is regularly improving its technology and employing existing technologies in new ways. Though Griffon takes reasonable precautions to ensure it does not infringe on the rights of others, it is possible that Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by others. If Griffon is found to have infringed on the propriety rights held by others, any related litigation or settlement relating to such infringement may have a material effect on Griffons business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIt is also possible that Griffons suppliers may inadvertently infringe on, or be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by others. For example, a product provided to HBP by one of its suppliers was found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of a competitor of this supplier. If other Griffon suppliers are found to have infringed (or are alleged to have infringed) on\nthe propriety rights of others, such infringement may have a material adverse effect on Griffons business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the supplier may not be able to develop an alternative design that meets Griffons needs at a comparable cost or at all, and the supply of certain products or components to Griffon may be interrupted.\nGriffon is exposed to product liability and warranty claims.\nGriffon is subject to product liability and warranty claims in the ordinary course of business, including with respect to former businesses now included within discontinued operations. These claims relate to the conformity of its products with required specifications, and to alleged or actual defects in Griffons products (or in end-products in which Griffons products were a component part) that cause damage to property or persons. There can be no assurance that the frequency and severity of product liability claims brought against Griffon will not increase, which claims can be brought either by an injured customer of an end product manufacturer who used one of Griffon's products as a component or by a direct purchaser. There is also no assurance that the number and value of warranty claims will not increase as compared to historical claim rates, or that Griffon's warranty reserve at any particular time is sufficient. No assurance can be given that indemnification from customers or coverage under insurance policies will be adequate to cover future product liability claims against Griffon; for example, product liability insurance typically does not cover claims for punitive damages. Warranty claims are typically not covered by insurance at all. Product liability insurance can be expensive, difficult to maintain and may be unobtainable in the future on acceptable terms. The amount and scope of any insurance coverage may be inadequate if a product liability claim is successfully asserted. Furthermore, if any significant claims are made, the business and the related financial condition of Griffon may be adversely affected by negative publicity.\nGriffon has been, and may in the future be, subject to claims and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.\nGriffons operations and assets are subject to environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, the handling and disposal of wastes, including solid and hazardous wastes, and otherwise relating to health, safety and protection of the environment, in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Griffon does not expect to make any expenditure with respect to ongoing compliance with or remediation under these environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results or financial condition. However, the applicable requirements under environmental laws and regulations may change at any time.\nGriffon can incur environmental costs related to sites that are no longer owned or operated, as well as third-party sites to which hazardous materials are sent. Material expenditures or liabilities may be incurred in connection with such claims. See the Commitment and Contingencies footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on environmental contingencies. Based on facts presently known, the outcome of current environmental matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on Griffons results of operations and financial condition. However, presently unknown environmental conditions, changes in environmental laws and regulations or other unanticipated events may give rise to claims that may involve material expenditures or liabilities.\nChanges in income tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect profitability.\nGriffon is subject to Federal, state and local income taxes in the U.S. and in various taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. Tax provisions and liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various U.S. and international tax jurisdictions. Griffons effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets or the amendment or enactment of tax laws. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits by U.S. Federal, state and local tax authorities, as well as tax authorities in the taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. If such audits result in assessments different from recorded income tax liabilities, Griffons future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to its income tax provision.\nActions taken by activist shareholders could be disruptive and costly and may conflict with or disrupt the strategic direction of our business.\nSimilar to the activist shareholder campaign initiated in 2021, activist shareholders may from time to time attempt to effect changes in our strategic direction and seek changes regarding Griffons corporate governance or structure. Our Board of Directors and management team strive to maintain constructive, ongoing communications with all shareholders who wish to speak with us, including activist shareholders, and welcomes their views and opinions with the goal of working together constructively to enhance value for all shareholders. However, activist campaigns that contest, or conflict with, our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on us because:\na.responding to actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time consuming, and divert the attention of our Board and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies, and\nb.perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may cause (i) instability or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, (ii) concern on the part of current or potential customers, (iii) loss of business opportunities, or (iv) difficulties in attracting and retain qualified personnel and business partners.\nActivist campaigns may also cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions, or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the fundamental underlying value of our businesses. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone. Item 2. Properties\nGriffon occupies approximately 10,460,000 square feet of general office, factory and warehouse space primarily throughout the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Australia, U.K., Ireland and China.

CPP also owns approximately 169,000 square feet of additional space for operational wood mills in the U.S.\nAll facilities are generally well maintained and suitable for the operations conducted. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nGriffon is involved in litigation, investigations and claims arising out of the normal conduct of business, including those relating to commercial transactions, product liability and warranty claims, environmental, employment, and health and safety matters. Griffon estimates and accrues liabilities resulting from such matters based on a variety of factors, including the stage of the proceeding; potential settlement value; assessments by internal and external counsel; and assessments by environmental engineers and consultants of potential environmental liabilities and remediation costs. Such estimates are not discounted to reflect the time value of money due to the uncertainty in estimating the timing of the expenditures, which may extend over several years.\nWhile it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to certain contingent liabilities and claims, Griffon believes, based upon examination of currently available information, experience to date, and advice from legal counsel, that the individual and aggregate liabilities resulting from the ultimate resolution of these contingent matters, after taking into consideration existing insurance coverage and amounts already provided for, will not have a material adverse impact on consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Refer to Note 16 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for a discussion of the Company's litigation. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5.

[Reserved] Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Unless otherwise indicated, all references to years or year-end refers to the fiscal year ending September 30 and dollars are in thousands, except per share data)\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company\nGriffon Corporation (the Company, Griffon, \"we\" or \"us\") is a diversified management and holding company that conducts business through wholly-owned subsidiaries. Griffon oversees the operations of its subsidiaries, allocates resources among them and manages their capital structures. Griffon provides direction and assistance to its subsidiaries in connection with acquisition and growth opportunities as well as in connection with divestitures. In order to further diversify, Griffon also seeks out, evaluates and, when appropriate, will acquire additional businesses that offer potentially attractive returns on capital.\nThe Company was founded in 1959, is a Delaware corporation headquartered in New York, N.Y. and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:GFF).\nOn September 27, 2021, Griffon announced it was exploring strategic alternatives for its Defense Electronics (\"DE\") segment, which consisted of our Telephonics Corporation (\"Telephonics\") subsidiary. On June 27, 2022, we completed the sale of Telephonics to TTM Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTMI) (\"TTM\") for $330,000 in cash, excluding customary post-closing adjustments, primarily related to working capital. Since September 2021, we have classified the results of operations of our Telephonics business as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operation as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets. Accordingly, all references made to results and information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to Griffon's continuing operations, unless noted otherwise.\nGriffon now conducts its operations through two reportable segments:\nConsumer and Professional Products (CPP) is a leading North American manufacturer and a global provider of branded consumer and professional tools; residential, industrial and commercial fans; home storage and organization products; and products that enhance indoor and outdoor lifestyles. CPP sells products globally through a portfolio of leading brands including AMES, since 1774, Hunter, since 1886, True Temper, and ClosetMaid. CPP revenue was 47%, 54%, and 55% of Griffons consolidated revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nHome and Building Products (\"HBP\") conducts its operations through Clopay. Founded in 1964, Clopay is the largest manufacturer and marketer of garage doors and rolling steel doors in North America. Residential and commercial sectional garage doors are sold through professional dealers and leading home center retail chains throughout North America under the brands Clopay, Ideal, and Holmes. Rolling steel door and grille products designed for commercial, industrial, institutional, and retail use are sold under the Cornell and Cookson brands. HBP revenue was 53%, 46% and 45% of Griffons consolidated revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOn May 16, 2022, Griffon announced that its Board of Directors initiated a process to review a comprehensive range of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value including a sale, merger, divestiture, recapitalization or other strategic transaction. This process is active and discussions with potential counterparties are ongoing with respect to a number of these options. The Committee on Strategic Considerations, a committee comprised of independent directors who serve on Griffon's Board, is overseeing the process and working with Griffon's management and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, the Company's financial advisor. There is no assurance that the process will result in any transaction being entered into or consummated.\nOn December 17, 2021, Griffon entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Hunter Fan Company (Hunter), a market leader in residential ceiling, commercial, and industrial fans, from MidOcean Partners (MidOcean) for a contractual purchase price of $845,000 and completed the acquisition on January 24, 2022. Hunter, part of our CPP segment, complements and diversifies our portfolio of leading consumer brands and products. We financed the acquisition of Hunter with a new $800,000 seven year Term Loan B facility; we used a combination of cash on hand and revolver borrowings to fund the balance of the purchase price and related acquisition and debt expenditures.\nOn December 22, 2020, AMES acquired Quatro Design Pty Ltd (Quatro), a leading Australian manufacturer and supplier of\nglass fiber reinforced concrete landscaping products for residential, commercial, and public sector projects. Quatro contributed approximately $5,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nIn August 2020 Griffon Corporation completed the public offering of 8,700,000 shares of our common stock for total net proceeds of $178,165 (the \"Public Offering\"). The Company used a portion of the net proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under its Credit Agreement. The Company used the remainder of the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nOn February 19, 2020, Griffon issued, at par, $850,000 of 5.75% Senior Notes due in 2028 and on June 8, 2020 Griffon issued an additional $150,000 of notes under the same indenture at 100.25% of par (collectively the \"2028 Senior Notes\"). Proceeds from the 2028 Senior Notes were used to redeem the $1,000,000 of 5.25% Senior Notes due 2022 (the \"2022 Senior Notes\").\nIn January 2020, Griffon amended its credit agreement to increase the total amount available for borrowing from $350,000 to $400,000, extend its maturity date from March 22, 2021 to March 22, 2025 and modify certain other provisions of the facility (the \"Credit Agreement\").\nOn November 29, 2019, AMES acquired Vatre Group Limited (\"Apta\"), a leading United Kingdom supplier of innovative garden pottery and associated products sold to leading UK and Ireland garden centers for approximately $10,500 (GBP 8,750), inclusive of a post-closing working capital adjustment, net of cash acquired. This acquisition broadens AMES' product offerings in the UK market and increases its in-country operational footprint. Apta contributed approximately $20,000 in revenue in the first 12 months after the acquisition.\nUpdate of COVID-19 on Our Business\nThe health and safety of our employees, our customers and their families is always a high priority for Griffon. As of the date of this filing, all of Griffon's facilities are fully operational. When COVID-19 struck, we implemented a variety of new policies and procedures, including additional cleaning, social distancing, staggered shifts and prohibiting or significantly restricting on-site visitors, to minimize the risk to our employees of contracting COVID-19. While many of these precautions have been relaxed or eliminated as the health risk of COVID-19 has decreased, we would not hesitate to reinstitute and/or modify these policies and procedures as necessary should the health risk return to an unacceptable level. In such event, our businesses or our suppliers could be required by government authorities to temporarily cease operations; might be limited in their production capacity due to complying with restrictions relating to the operation of businesses to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19; or could suffer their own supply chain disruptions, impacting their ability to continue to supply us with the quantity of materials required by us. While we are unable to determine or predict the nature, duration or scope of the overall impact COVID-19 will have on our businesses, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, we believe it is important to discuss where our company stands today, how we have responded (and will continue to respond) to COVID 19 and how our operations and financial condition may change as COVID-19 evolves. See information provided in Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2022 Compared to 2021\nRevenue for the year ended September 30, 2022 of $2,848,488 compared to $2,270,626 for the year ended September 30, 2021 increased 25% resulting from increased revenue at HBP and CPP of 45% and 9%, respectively. Hunter (purchased on January 24, 2022) contributed $246,474 of revenue in 2022.\nGross profit for 2022 was $936,886 compared to $641,113 in 2021. Gross profit as a percent of sales (gross margin) for 2022 and 2021 was 32.9% and 28.2%, respectively. In the years ended 2022 and 2021, gross profit included restructuring charges of $7,964 and $7,923, respectively. In the year ended 2022, gross profit also included amortization of $5,401 related to the fair value step-up of acquired inventory sold in connection with the Hunter Fan acquisition. Excluding these charges from both years, gross profit would have been $950,251 or 33.4% of revenue, compared to $649,036 or 28.6% in the prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2022 of $608,926 increased 29% from $470,530 in 2021. The 2022 SG&A expenses included restructuring charges of $8,818, acquisition costs of $9,303, strategic review (retention and other) of $9,683, special dividend ESOP charges of $10,538, proxy expenses of $6,952. The 2021 SG&A expenses included restructuring charges of $13,495. Excluding these items from both periods, 2022 SG&A expenses would have been $563,632, or 19.8% of revenue compared to $457,035 or 20.1%, with the increase in expenses primarily due to the inclusion of expenses related to Hunter, which was acquired in January 2022, and increased distribution and shipping costs.\nIn connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, Griffon performed its annual impairment testing of its goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles. Indicators of impairment were present due to decreases in comparable company market multiples for the CPP reporting units and increased interest rates, and the related impact on weighted average cost of capital rates. Accordingly, a quantitative assessment was performed, which resulted in non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles of $342,027 and $175,000. respectively, recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022.\nInterest expense in 2022 of $84,379 increased 34% compared to 2021 of $63,175, primarily as a result of increased debt levels related to the $800,000 seven year Term Loan B facility entered into in connection with the Hunter acquisition, of which Griffon repaid $300,000 aggregate principal amount in the third quarter of 2022.\nOther income (expense) of $6,881 and $2,107 in 2022 and 2021, respectively, includes $305 and ($81), respectively, of net currency exchange transaction gains (losses) from receivables and payables held in non-functional currencies, $(225) and $283, respectively, of net gains (losses) on investments, and $4,256 and $907, respectively, of net periodic benefit plan income. Other income (expense) also includes rental income of $689 in 2022 and $624 in 2021. Additionally, it includes royalty income of $2,250 for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nGriffon reported Income (loss) before tax from continuing operations for 2022 of $(270,879) compared to $109,955 for 2021. In 2022, the Company had an effective income tax rate of (6.2)% compared to 36.1% in 2021. The 2022 tax rate included $3,913 of discrete and certain other tax provisions net, and other items that affect comparability, as listed below. The 2021 tax rate included $3,245 of discrete and certain other tax provisions, net, and other items that affect comparability, as listed below. Excluding the discrete and certain other tax provisions, net, and other items that affect comparability, as listed below, the effective income tax rates for 2022 and 2021 were 29.0% and 31.7%, respectively. These rates reflect the impact of tax reserves and changes in earnings mix between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.\nLoss from continuing operations for 2022 was $287,715, or $5.57 per share, compared to Income from continuing operations of $70,302, or $1.32 per share in 2021. The 2022 income from continuing operations included the following:\n- Restructuring charges of $16,782 ($12,479, net of tax, or $0.23 per share);\n- Debt extinguishment, net $4,529 ($3,474, net of tax, or $0.06 per share);\n- Acquisition costs of $9,303 ($8,149, net of tax, or $0.15 per share);\n- Strategic review - retention and other of $9,683 ($7,280, net of tax, or $0.13 per share);\n- Special dividend ESOP charges of $10,538 ($8,083, net of tax, or $0.15 per share);\n- Proxy expenses of $6,952 ($5,359, net of tax, or $0.10 per share);\n- Fair value step-up of acquired inventory sold of $5,401 ($4,012, net of tax, or $0.07 per share);\n- Goodwill and intangible asset impairments of $517,027 ($454,753, net of tax, or $8.43 per share); and\n- Discrete and certain other tax provision, net, of $3,913 or 0.07 per share.\nThe 2021 income from continuing operations included the following:\n- Restructuring charges of $21,418 ($16,131, net of tax, or $0.30 per share); and\n- Discrete and certain other tax provision, net, of $3,245 or $0.06 per share.\nExcluding these items from both reporting periods, 2022 Income from continuing operations would have been $219,786, or $4.07 per share compared to $89,678, or $1.68 per share, in 2021.\n2021 Compared to 2020\nRevenue for the year ended September 30, 2021 of $2,270,626 compared to $2,066,546 in the year ended September 30, 2020 increased 10% resulting from increased revenue at HBP and CPP of 12% and 8%, respectively.\nGross profit for 2021 was $641,113 compared to $583,994 in 2020. Gross margin as a percent of sales (gross margin) for 2021 and 2020 was 28.2% and 28.3%, respectively. In the years ended 2021 and 2020, gross profit included restructuring charges of $7,923 and $4,159, respectively. Excluding restructuring charges from both years, gross profit would have been $649,036 or 28.6% of revenue, compared to $588,153 or 28.5% in the prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2021 of $470,530 increased 6% from $444,454 in 2020. The 2021 SG&A expenses included restructuring charges of $13,495. The 2020 SG&A expenses included restructuring charges of $9,510, acquisition costs of $2,960 and income from the reversal of contingent consideration related to the Kelkay acquisition of $1,733. Excluding these items from both periods, the 2021 SG&A expenses would have been $457,035, or 20.1% of revenue compared to $433,717 or 21.0%, with the increase in expenses primarily due to increased distribution and shipping costs.\nInterest expense in 2021 of $63,175 decreased 5% compared to 2020 of $66,544, primarily as a result of decreased outstanding borrowings and decreased variable interest rates on our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOther income (expense) of $2,107 and $1,661 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, includes $81 and $915, respectively, of net currency exchange transaction losses from receivables and payables held in non-functional currencies, $283 and $184, respectively, of net gains on investments, and $907 and $1,559, respectively, of net periodic benefit plan income. Other income (expense) also includes rental income of $624 in both 2021 and 2020.\nGriffon reported Income before tax from continuing operations for 2021 of $109,955 compared to $67,481 for 2020. In 2021, the Company had an effective income tax rate of 36.1% compared to 38.6% in 2020. The 2021 tax rate included $3,245 of discrete and certain other tax provisions, net, and other items that affect comparability, as listed below. The 2020 tax rate included $966 of discrete and certain other tax provisions, net, and other items that affect comparability, as listed below. Excluding the discrete and certain other tax provisions, net, and other items that affect comparability, as listed below, the effective income tax rates for 2021 and 2020 were 31.7% and 33.9%, respectively. These rates reflect the impact of tax reserves and changes in earnings mix between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.\nIncome from continuing operations for 2021 was $70,302, or $1.32 per share, compared to $41,444, or $0.92 per share in 2020. The 2021 income from continuing operations included the following:\n- Restructuring charges of $21,418 ($16,131, net of tax, or $0.30 per share); and\n- Discrete and certain other tax provision, net, of $3,245 or $0.06 per share.\nThe 2020 income from continuing operations included the following:\n- Restructuring charges of $13,669 ($10,177, net of tax, or $0.23 per share);\n- Loss from debt extinguishment $7,925 ($6,167, net of tax, or $0.14 per share);\n- Acquisition costs of $2,960 ($2,297, net of tax, or $0.05 per share); and\n- Acquisition contingent consideration benefit of $1,733 ($1,403, net of tax, or $0.03 per share); and\n- Discrete and certain other tax provision, net, of $966 or $0.02 per share.\nExcluding these items from both reporting periods, 2021 Income from continuing operations would have been $89,678, or $1.68 per share compared to $59,647, or $1.33 per share, in 2020.\nGriffon evaluates performance based on Earnings (loss) per share and Income (loss) from continuing operations excluding non-cash impairment charges, restructuring charges, debt extinguishment, acquisition related expenses, discrete and certain other tax items, as well other items that may affect comparability, as applicable. Griffon believes this information is useful to investors for the same reason.

These benefits were partially offset by a 20% reduction in volume primarily from reduced consumer demand and rebalancing of customer inventory levels in North America and the United Kingdom (U.K.), in part offset by Australia. Foreign exchange was an unfavorable impact of 2%.\nCPP Adjusted EBITDA in 2022 decreased 14% to $99,308 compared to $115,673 in 2021. Excluding the Hunter contribution of $43,579, EBITDA of $55,729 decreased 52% primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the reduced volume noted above and the related impact on manufacturing absorption, and increased material, labor and transportation costs, partially offset by the benefits of price and mix. The year ended September 30, 2022 included increased demurrage and detention costs, primarily related to COVID-19 and global supply chain disruptions, of approximately $15,172 ($9,512 related to Hunter).\nSegment depreciation and amortization increased $13,129 from the comparable prior year period primarily due to depreciation for new assets placed in service and the Hunter assets acquired.\nOn January 24, 2022, Griffon completed the acquisition of Hunter Fan Company (Hunter), a market leader in residential ceiling, commercial, and industrial fans for a contractual purchase price of $845,000. Hunter adds to Griffon's CPP segment, complementing and diversifying our portfolio of leading consumer brands and products.\nOn December 22, 2020, AMES acquired Quatro Design Pty Ltd (Quatro), a leading Australian manufacturer and supplier of glass fiber reinforced concrete landscaping products for residential, commercial, and public sector projects, for approximately AU$3,500.\nStrategic Initiative and Restructuring Charges\nIn November 2019, Griffon announced the development of a next-generation business platform for CPP to enhance the growth, efficiency, and competitiveness of its U.S. operations, and on November 12, 2020, Griffon announced that CPP was broadening this strategic initiative to include additional North American facilities, the AMES United Kingdom (U.K.) and Australia businesses, and a manufacturing facility in China. On April 28, 2022, Griffon announced a reduced scope and an accelerated timeline for the initiative, which was completed in fiscal 2022. These changes reflect the rapid progress made with the\ninitiative, and reduced investment in facilities expansion and equipment given recent significant increases in construction and equipment costs. Any remaining expenditures, after the end of fiscal 2022, including those related to the deployment of AMES' global information systems, will be included in the continuing operations of the business. Future investments in equipment, particularly for automation, will be part of normal-course annual capital expenditures.\nThis initiative included three key development areas. First, certain AMES U.S. and global operations were consolidated to optimize facilities footprint and talent. Second, strategic investments in automation and facilities expansion were made to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing and fulfillment operations, and support e-commerce growth. Third, multiple independent information systems were unified into a single data and analytics platform, which will serve the whole AMES global enterprise.\nWe continue to expect that this initiative with result in annual cash savings of $25,000. Realization of expected cash savings will begin in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The cost to implement this new business platform, over the duration of the project, included one-time charges of approximately $51,869 and capital investments of approximately $15,000, net of future proceeds from the sale of exited facilities. Cumulative charges of $51,869 consisted of cash charges totaling $35,691 and non-cash, asset-related charges totaling $16,178; the cash charges included $12,934 for one-time termination benefits and other personnel-related costs and $22,757 for facility exit costs. During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, CPP incurred pre-tax restructuring and related exit costs approximating $16,782 and $21,418, respectively. During the years ended September, 30, 2022 and 2021, capital expenditures of $6,337 and $8,774, respectively, were driven by investment in CPP business intelligence systems and e-commerce facility.\nCash Charges Non-Cash Charges\nPersonnel related costs Facilities, exit costs and other Facility and other Total Capital Investments\nPhase I $ 12,000 $ 4,000 $ 19,000 35,000 $ 40,000\nPhase II 14,000 16,000 - 30,000 25,000\nIncrease (Reduction) in Scope (13,066) 2,757 (2,822) (13,131) (50,000)\nTotal Charges 12,934 22,757 16,178 51,869 15,000\nTotal 2020 restructuring charges (5,620) (3,357) (4,692) (13,669) (6,733)\nTotal 2021 restructuring charges (3,190) (11,573) (6,655) (21,418) (8,774)\nTotal 2022 restructuring charges (4,124) (7,827) (4,831) (16,782) (6,337)\nTotal cumulative charges $ (12,934) $ (22,757) $ (16,178) $ (51,869) $ (21,844)\nEstimate to Complete $ - $ - $ - $ - $ (6,844) (a)\n(a) Includes future proceeds from the sale of exited facilities.\n2021 Compared to 2020\nCPP revenue in 2021 increased $90,285, or 8%, compared to 2020, comprised of a 3% increase in volume, driven by increased consumer demand across all international geographies, partially offset by reduced volume in the U.S. due to labor, transportation and supply chain disruptions.

As a result, Griffon classified the results of operations of the Telephonics business as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operation as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets. Accordingly, all references made to results and information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to Griffon's continuing operations unless noted otherwise.\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, Griffon's discontinued assets and liabilities includes the Company's obligation of $8,846 in connection with the sale of Telephonics related to certain customary post-closing adjustments, primarily working capital and retention bonuses.

See Note 8, Discontinued Operations.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity\nManagement assesses Griffons liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, bank lines of credit and the ability to attract long-term capital under satisfactory terms. Griffon believes it has sufficient liquidity available to invest in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing its capital structure on both a short-term and long-term basis.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $54,200. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the U.S., and we do not currently anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event we determine that funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the U.S., we will be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds (unless applicable U.S. taxes have already been paid).\nGriffon's primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations, cash on hand and our January 2025 five-year secured $400,000 revolving credit facility (\"Credit Facility\").

The 2028 Senior Notes were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") via an exchange offer. The fair value of the 2028 Senior Notes approximated $833,433 on September 30, 2022 based upon quoted market prices (level 1 inputs).

In connection with the prepayment of the Term Loan B Griffon recognized a $6,296 charge on the prepayment of debt, $5,575 related to the write-off of underwriting fees and other expenses and $721 of the original issue discount. The Term Loan B facility is subject to the same affirmative and negative covenants that apply to the Revolver, but is not subject to any financial maintenance covenants. Term Loan B borrowings are secured by the same collateral as the Revolver. The fair value of the Term Loan B facility approximated $476,160 on September 30, 2022 based upon quoted market prices (level 1 inputs). At September 30, 2022, $8,823 of underwriting fees and other expenses incurred remained to be amortized.\nThe Revolver's maximum borrowing availability is $400,000 and it matures on March 22, 2025.

Borrowings under the Revolver may be repaid and re-borrowed at any time. Interest is payable on borrowings at either a SOFR, SONIA or base rate benchmark rate, plus an applicable margin, which adjusts based on financial performance. Current margins are 0.50% for base rate loans, 1.50% for SOFR loans and 1.50% for SONIA loans. The Revolver has certain financial maintenance tests including a maximum total leverage ratio, a maximum senior secured leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The negative covenants place limits on Griffon's ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, and make restricted payments and investments. Both the Revolver and Term Loan B borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Griffons material domestic subsidiaries and are secured, on a first priority basis, by substantially all domestic assets of the Company and the guarantors, and a pledge of not greater than 65% of the equity interest in Griffons material, first-tier foreign subsidiaries. At September 30, 2022, under the Credit Agreement, there were $97,328 in outstanding borrowings; outstanding standby letters of credit were $12,287; and $290,385 was available, subject to certain loan covenants, for borrowing at that date.\nAt September 30, 2022, Griffon and its subsidiaries were in compliance with the terms and covenants of its credit and loan agreements.

Purchase obligations reflect those purchase orders in which the commitment is considered to be firm.\nGriffon rents real property and equipment under operating leases expiring at various dates. Operating lease obligations over the next twelve months is approximately $40,998. Refer to Note 21 - Leases.\nCustomers\nA small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffons consolidated revenue. In 2022, Home Depot represented 13% of Griffons consolidated revenue, 19% of CPP's revenue and 7% of HBP's revenue.\nNo other customer exceeded 10% or more of consolidated revenue. Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffons largest customers and our relationships with them. Orders from these customers are subject to change and may fluctuate materially. The loss of all or a portion of volume from any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on Griffons liquidity and operations.\nSUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nGriffons Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally by Clopay Corporation, The AMES Companies, Inc., Clopay AMES Holding Corp., ClosetMaid LLC, AMES Hunter Holdings Corporation, Hunter Fan Company, CornellCookson, LLC and Cornell Real Estate Holdings, LLC, all of which are indirectly 100% owned by Griffon. In accordance with Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act, presented below are summarized financial information of the Parent (Griffon) subsidiaries and the Guarantor subsidiaries as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 and for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. All intercompany balances and transactions between subsidiaries under Parent and subsidiaries under the Guarantor have been eliminated. The information presented below excludes eliminations necessary to arrive at the information on a consolidated basis. The summarized information excludes financial information of the Non-Guarantors, including earnings from and investments in these entities. The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations or financial position of the guarantor companies or non-guarantor companies had they operated as independent entities. The guarantor companies and the non-guarantor companies include the consolidated financial results of their wholly-owned subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method.\nThe indentures relating to the Senior Notes (the Indentures) contain terms providing that, under certain limited circumstances, a guarantor will be released from its obligations to guarantee the Senior Notes. These circumstances include (i) a sale of at least a majority of the stock, or all or substantially all the assets, of the subsidiary guarantor as permitted by the Indentures; (ii) a public equity offering of a subsidiary guarantor that qualifies as a Minority Business as defined in the Indentures (generally, a business the EBITDA of which constitutes less than 50% of the segment adjusted EBITDA of the Company for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters), and that meets certain other specified conditions as set forth in the Indentures; (iii) the designation of a guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary as defined in the Indentures, in compliance with the terms of the Indentures; (iv) Griffon exercising its right to defease the Senior Notes, or to otherwise discharge its obligations under the Indentures, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Indentures; and (v) upon obtaining the requisite consent of the holders of the Senior Notes.\nSummarized Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nFor the Year Ended For the Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nParent Company Guarantor Companies Parent Company Guarantor Companies\nNet sales $ - $ 2,301,215 $ - $ 1,727,074\nGross profit $ - $ 752,982 $ - $ 459,879\nIncome (loss) from operations $ (43,492) $ (127,982) $ (22,321) $ 135,510\nEquity in earnings of Guarantor subsidiaries $ (184,618) $ - $ 75,769 $ -\nNet income (loss) $ (74,423) $ (184,618) $ (40,047) $ 75,769\nSummarized Balance Sheet Information\nFor the Year Ended For the Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nParent Company Guarantor Companies Parent Company Guarantor Companies\nCurrent assets $ 49,238 $ 915,329 $ 116,260 $ 746,371\nNon-current assets 15,571 1,393,864 15,782 999,138\nTotal assets $ 64,809 $ 2,309,193 $ 132,042 $ 1,745,509\nCurrent liabilities $ 78,635 $ 275,165 $ 41,334 $ 321,363\nLong-term debt 1,538,235 12,886 998,787 $ 14,482\nOther liabilities 4,331 322,224 43,337 $ 156,694\nTotal liabilities $ 1,621,201 $ 610,275 $ 1,083,458 $ 492,539\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of Griffons consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. of America (GAAP) requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in public disclosures of Griffon, including information regarding contingencies, risk and its financial condition. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions, and form the basis for estimating the carrying values of assets and liabilities, as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment for commitments and contingencies. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates.\nAn estimate is considered to be critical if it is subjective and if changes in the estimate using different assumptions would result in a material impact on Griffons financial position or results of operations. The following have been identified as the most critical accounting policies and estimates:\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations identified under the terms of contracts with its customers are satisfied. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a bundle of goods or services, to the customer, and is the unit of accounting. A contract with a customer is an agreement which both parties have approved, that creates enforceable rights and obligations, has commercial substance and with respect to which payment terms are identified and collectability is probable. Once the Company has entered into a contract or purchase order, it is evaluated to identify performance obligations. For each performance obligation, revenue is recognized when control of the promised products is transferred to the customer, or services are satisfied under the contract or purchase order, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services (the transaction price).\nA contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. A majority of the Companys contracts have a single performance obligation which represents, in most cases, the product being sold to the customer. To a lesser extent, some contracts include multiple performance obligations such as a product, the related installation, and extended warranty services. These contracts require judgment in determining the number of performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these contacts are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes. In these types of contracts, the Company allocates the total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. The Company uses an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price for separate performance obligations or a cost plus margin approach when one is not available. The transaction price includes variable consideration, such as discounts and volume rebates, when it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognized will not occur. Variable consideration is determined using either the expected value or the most likely amount of consideration to be received based on historical experience and the specific facts and circumstances at the time of evaluation.\nThe Companys performance obligations are recognized at a point in time related to the manufacture and sale of a broad range of products and components, and revenue is recognized when title, and risk and rewards of ownership, have transferred to the customer, which is generally upon shipment.\nA majority of the Company's revenue is short cycle in nature with shipments occurring within one year from order and does not include a material long-term financing component, implicitly or explicitly. Payment terms generally range between 15 to 90 days and vary by the location of the business, the type of products manufactured to be sold and the volume of products sold, among other factors.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when all factors are met, including when control of a product transfers to the customer upon its shipment, completion of installation, testing, certification or other substantive acceptance required under the contract. Other than standard product warranty provisions, sales arrangements provide for no other significant post-shipment obligations on the Company. From time-to-time and for certain customers, rebates and other sales incentives, promotional allowances or discounts are offered, typically related to customer purchase volumes, all of which are fixed or determinable and are classified as a reduction of revenue and recorded at the time of sale. Griffon provides for sales returns and allowances based upon historical returns experience. The Company includes shipping costs billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs in either Cost of Goods and Services and Selling, general and administrative expenses, as applicable.\nThe majority of the Companys contracts offer assurance-type warranties in connection with the sale of a product to a customer. Assurance-type warranties provide a customer with assurance that the related product will function as the parties intended because it complies with agreed-upon specifications. Such warranties do not represent a separate performance obligation.\nPayment terms vary depending on the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. Generally, the period between the time revenue is recognized and the time payment is due is not significant. Shipping and handling charges are not considered a separate performance obligation. Additionally, all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected from a customer (e.g., sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes) are excluded from revenue.\nInventories\nInventories, stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out or average) or net realizable value, include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs.\nGriffons businesses typically do not require inventory that is susceptible to becoming obsolete or dated. In general, HBP produces residential and commercial sectional garage doors, commercial rolling steel door and grille products, and CPP produces long-handled tools and landscaping products, storage and organizational products and residential, industrial and commercial fans, all in response to orders from customers of retailers and dealers or based on expected orders, as applicable.\nWarranty Accruals\nDirect customer and end-user warranties are provided on certain products. These warranties cover manufacturing defects that would prevent the product from performing in line with its intended and marketed use. The terms of such warranties vary by product line and generally provide for the repair or replacement of the defective product. Warranty claims data is collected and analyzed with a focus on the historical amount of claims, the products involved, the amount of time between the warranty claims and the products respective sales and the amount of current sales. Based on such analysis, warranty accruals are recorded as an increase to cost of sales and regularly reviewed for adequacy.\nStock-based Compensation\nGriffon has issued stock-based compensation to certain employees, officers and directors in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units.\nCompensation expense for restricted stock and restricted stock units is recognized ratably over the required service period based on the fair value of the grant, calculated as the number of shares or units granted multiplied by the stock price on the date of grant, and for performance shares or units, the likelihood of achieving the performance criteria. For certain restricted stock grants with a performance metric related to Griffon's stock price, the company performs a valuation as of the date of grant and recognizes the expense over the vesting period. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.\nExpected Loss Allowances for Discount, Doubtful Account and Returns\nTrade receivables are recorded at their stated amount, less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. The expected loss allowance represents estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations (usually due to customers potential insolvency), discounts related to early payment of accounts receivables by customers and estimates for returns. The expected loss allowance for doubtful accounts includes amounts for certain customers in which a risk of default has been specifically identified, as well as an amount for customer defaults, based on a formula, when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. Allowance for discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue and the provision related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in SG&A expenses.\nAcquisitions\nAcquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date and that the fair value of acquired in-process research and development be recorded on the balance sheet. Related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the purchase price over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nGoodwill, Long-Lived Intangible and Tangible Assets, and Impairment\nAs of September 30, 2022, the balance of goodwill on our balance sheet is $335,790 and indefinite-lived intangibles representing our trademarks is $399,668. We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, and more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below the carrying amount. Such events or changes in circumstance include significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate in which our reporting units operate, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, when some portion of a reporting unit is disposed of or classified as held for sale, or when a change in the composition of reporting units occurs for other reasons, such as a change in operating segments. To test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we may perform both a qualitative assessment and quantitative assessment. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment, we consider operating results as well as circumstances impacting the operations or cash flows of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions and reporting unit events and circumstances. For the quantitative test, the assessment is based on both an income-based and market-based valuation approach. If it is determined that an impairment exists, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value.\nUnder the income-based approach, we determine the fair value of a reporting unit by using discounted cash flows that require significant judgement and assumptions, such as our best estimate of future revenue, operating costs, cash flows, expected long-term cash flow growth rates (terminal value growth rates), and risk adjusted discount rates. Under the market-based approach, we determine the fair value of a reporting unit by applying those multiples exhibited by comparable publicly traded companies and those multiples paid in acquisitions of peer company transactions to the financial results of the reporting units. We then compare the fair value estimates resulting from the income and market-based valuations to the sum of Griffons market capitalization and net debt position to assess the reasonableness of the implied control premium. We determine the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets by using the relief from royalty method, which estimates the value of a trademark by discounting to present value the hypothetical royalty payments that are saved by owning the asset rather than licensing it.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we performed a qualitative assessment of the HBP reporting unit and determined that indicators that the fair value was less than the carrying amount were not present. However, indicators of impairment were present for our CPP reporting units driven by a decrease in comparable company market multiples and an increase in interest rates and the related impact on weighted average cost of capital rates. As such, in connection with the preparation of our\nfinancial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we performed a quantitative assessment of the CPP reporting units using both an income-based and market-based approach. The impairment tests resulted in a pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $342,027. Further, we compared the estimated fair values of the CPP indefinite lived intangibles to their carrying amounts which resulted in a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $175,000. A 100-basis point increase in the discount rate would have resulted in an additional impairment charge to our indefinite-lived intangible assets of $34,000.\nWe performed a qualitative assessment as of September 30, 2021, and 2020, as the estimated fair values of each reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying amount based on our baseline quantitative assessment, which was performed as of March 31, 2020. Our qualitative assessment determined that indicators that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than the carrying amount were not present. We performed a qualitative assessment as of September 30, 2021, and 2020 considering all the above factors and determined that indefinite-lived intangibles fair values were greater than their book values.\nLong-lived assets, such as customer relationships and software, and tangible assets, primarily property, plant and equipment, are amortized over their expected useful lives, which involve significant assumptions and estimates. We assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of such assets based on the expectations of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset group. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, a loss would be recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we tested long-lived intangible and tangible assets for impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted cash flows of each CPP asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group and determined that an impairment did not exist. No event or indicator of impairment existed for the HBP assets groups.\nFair value estimates are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Any changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects, which may result from a decline in Griffons stock price, a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of Griffons control, or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of Griffons reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.\nLeases\nOn October 1, 2019, the Company adopted the Accounting Standards Codifications (\"ASC\") Topic 842, Leases, which requires the recording of operating lease Right-of-Use (\"ROU\") assets and operating lease liabilities. Finance leases were not impacted by the adoption of ASC Topic 842, as finance lease liabilities and the corresponding assets were already recorded in the balance sheet under the previous guidance, ASC Topic 840. The Company has elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allows us to carry forward the historical lease classification. We also elected a practical expedient to determine the reasonably certain lease term.\nThe Company applied the modified retrospective approach, whereby the cumulative effect of adoption is recognized as of the date of adoption and comparative prior periods are not retrospectively adjusted. As a result, upon adoption, we recognized ROU assets of $163,552 and lease liabilities of $163,676 associated with our operating leases. The standard had no material impact to retained earnings or on our Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. For leases existing as of October 1, 2019, we have elected to use the remaining lease term as of the adoption date in determining the incremental borrowing rate. Our determination of the lease term may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The ROU assets and short and long-term liabilities associated with our operating leases are shown as separate line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant, and equipment, net, other accrued liabilities, and other non-current liabilities.\nFor operating leases, fixed lease payments are recognized as operating lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases and impaired operating leases, the ROU asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term, along with recognition of interest expense associated with accretion of the lease liability. For leases with a lease term of 12 months or less (a \"Short-term\" lease), any fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over such term, and are not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Variable lease cost for both operating and finance leases, if any, is recognized as incurred. The Company has lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, we account for lease components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance).\nRestructuring Reserves\nFrom time to time, Griffon will establish restructuring reserves at an operation. These reserves, for both termination and facility related exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though Griffon believes the estimates made are reasonable, they could differ materially from the actual costs.\nIncome Taxes\nGriffons effective tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which Griffon operates. For interim financial reporting, the annual tax rate is estimated based on projected taxable income for the full year, and a quarterly income tax provision is recorded in accordance with the anticipated annual rate. As the year progresses, the annual tax rate is refined as new information becomes available, including year-to-date financial results. This process often results in changes to the effective tax rate throughout the year. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which a tax benefit has been recorded in the income statement. The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses; a forecast of future profitability; the duration of statutory carryback and carryforward periods; the Company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused; and tax planning alternatives. The likelihood that the deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income is assessed at least quarterly, and the valuation allowance, if any, is adjusted accordingly.\nTax benefits are recognized for an uncertain tax position when, in managements judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount that is judged to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized in the period in which they are identified. The effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which Griffon has recorded a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, Griffon believes its liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate. Favorable resolution of an unrecognized tax benefit could be recognized as a reduction in Griffons tax provision and effective tax rate in the period of resolution. Unfavorable settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit may require the use of cash in the period of resolution. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as non-current. However, if it is anticipated that a cash settlement will occur within one year, that portion of the liability is presented as current. Interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is recorded as income tax expense.\nPension Benefits\nGriffon sponsors defined and supplemental benefit pension plans for certain active and retired employees. Annual amounts relating to these plans are recorded based on actuarial projections, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases and turnover rates. The actuarial assumptions used to determine pension liabilities, assets and expense are reviewed annually and modified based on current economic conditions and trends. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the nature of the plans investments and expectations for long-term rates of return. The discount rate used to measure obligations is based on a corporate bond spot-rate yield curve that matches projected future benefit payments, with the appropriate spot rate applicable to the timing of the projected future benefit\npayments. Assumptions used in determining Griffons obligations under the defined benefit pension plans are believed to be reasonable, based on experience and advice from independent actuaries; however, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect Griffons financial position or results of operations.\nAll of the defined benefit plans are frozen and have ceased accruing benefits.\nNew Accounting Standards\nFor a discussion of the new accounting standards impacting the Company, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rates\nGriffons exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to variable interest rate debt and investments in cash and equivalents.\nGriffon's amended and restated Credit Agreement references a benchmark rate with SONIA or SOFR. In addition, certain other\nof Griffons credit facilities have a LIBOR and BBSY (Bank Bill Swap Rate) based variable interest rate. Due to the current\nand expected level of borrowings under these facilities, a 100 basis point change in SONIA, SOFR, BBSY, or LIBOR would\nnot have a material impact on Griffons results of operations or liquidity.\nForeign Exchange\nGriffon conducts business in various non-U.S. countries, primarily in Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand and China; therefore, changes in the value of the currencies of these countries affect the financial position and cash flows when translated into U.S. Dollars. Griffon has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its non-U.S. operations. Griffon may, from time to time, hedge its currency risk exposures. A change of 10% in the value of all applicable foreign currencies would not have a material effect on Griffons financial position and cash flows. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe financial statements of Griffon and its subsidiaries and the report thereon of Grant Thornton LLP (PCAOB ID 248) are included herein:\n\u25aaReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.\n\u25aaConsolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2022 and 2021.\n\u25aaConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\u25aaConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\u25aaConsolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\u25aaNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\u25aaSchedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Account.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Shareholders\nGriffon Corporation\nOpinions on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Griffon Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule included under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the financial statements). We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nBasis for opinions\nThe Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nOur audit of, and opinion on, the Companys internal control over financial reporting does not include the internal control over financial reporting of Hunter Fan Company (Hunter), a wholly-owned subsidiary, whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting 31 percent and 9 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022. As indicated in Managements Report, Hunter Fan Company was acquired during 2022. Managements assertion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting excluded internal control over financial reporting of Hunter Fan Company.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical audit matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAnnual Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing\nAs described further in notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually at the reporting unit level. The Company performed its annual impairment testing of goodwill as of September 30, 2022, comparing the fair value of the Companys reporting units to the respective reporting units carrying value, including goodwill. For the Consumer Professional Products (CPP) and Hunter reporting units and associated indefinite-lived intangible assets, indicators of impairment were present, and as such, the Company performed a quantitative assessment. The fair value of CPP and Hunter were determined using a combination of the income and market-based valuation approach methodologies, which include the present value of expected future cash flows and the use of market assumptions specific to each reporting unit. The Company used prospective financial information to which discount rates were applied to calculate the fair value. Similarly to goodwill, the Company tested indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment as of September 30, 2022. The Company utilized a relief from royalty method to calculate and compare the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their book value, which includes the use of market assumptions specific to each reporting unit. As a result of the impairment tests, the Company recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment as of September 30, 2022. We identified the Companys impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for CPP and Hunter as a critical audit matter.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that the impairment testing is a critical audit matter are as follows: The determination of the fair value of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles require management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future cash flows and discount rates. This requires management to evaluate historical results and expectations of future operating performance based on relevant information available to them regarding expectations of industry performance, as well as expectations for entity-specific performance. In addition, determining the discount rate requires management to evaluate the appropriate risk premium based on their judgment of industry and entity-specific risks. Management also used a selection of comparable companies that correspond to each reporting unit to derive a market-based multiple. As disclosed by management, changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived assets. In turn, auditing these judgments and assumptions requires a high degree of auditor judgment.\nOur audit procedures related to the quantitative impairment testing included the following: We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to the impairment testing, including the Companys ability to develop the estimates utilized in calculating the fair value of the CPP and Hunter reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Such estimates included prospective financial information, long-term growth rates, discount rates and weighted average cost of capital. With the assistance of valuation specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of the valuation methodology utilized and assessed the appropriateness of inputs utilized. We evaluated the qualifications of those responsible for preparing the calculations of fair values. We tested the inputs, significant judgments and estimates utilized in performing the annual impairment test, which included comparing managements judgments and estimates to industry and market data. We tested the inputs, significant judgments and estimates, as follows: a) tested prospective financial information and long-term growth rates by comparing to historical trends and industry expectations, performed a sensitivity analysis over growth rates and assessed managements historical ability to accurately forecast; b) tested discount and royalty rates by comparing to historical rates and industry expectations, compared rates to market comparable companies, including comparable licensing agreements and independently calculated discount rates for comparison to those used by management; and c) tested weighted average cost of capital by analyzing the implied discount rate and independently calculated a weighted-average discount rate using individual discount rates and compared to the rate utilized by management.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2006.\nNew York, New York\nNovember 17 , 2022\nGRIFFON CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nAt September 30, 2022 At September 30, 2021\nCURRENT ASSETS\nCash and equivalents $ 120,184 $ 248,653\nAccounts receivable, net of allowances of $12,137 and $8,787\n361,653 294,804\nInventories 669,193 472,794\nPrepaid and other current assets 62,453 76,009\nAssets of discontinued operations held for sale -

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDescription of business\nGriffon Corporation (the Company, Griffon, \"we\" or \"us\") is a diversified management and holding company that conducts business through wholly-owned subsidiaries. Griffon oversees the operations of its subsidiaries, allocates resources among them and manages their capital structures. Griffon provides direction and assistance to its subsidiaries in connection with acquisition and growth opportunities as well as in connection with divestitures. In order to further diversify, Griffon also seeks out, evaluates and, when appropriate, will acquire additional businesses that offer potentially attractive returns on capital.\nThe Company was founded in 1959, is a Delaware corporation headquartered in New York, N.Y. and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:GFF).\nOn May 16, 2022, Griffon announced that its Board of Directors initiated a process to review a comprehensive range of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value including a sale, merger, divestiture, recapitalization or other strategic transaction. This process is active and discussions with potential counterparties are ongoing with respect to a number of these options. The Committee on Strategic Considerations, a committee comprised of independent directors who serve on Griffon's Board, is overseeing the process and working with Griffon's management and Goldman Sachs & Co, LLC. the Company's financial advisor. There is no assurance that the process will result in any transaction being entered into or consummated.\nOn December 17, 2021, Griffon entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Hunter Fan Company (Hunter), a market leader in residential ceiling, commercial, and industrial fans, from MidOcean Partners (MidOcean) for a contractual purchase price of $845,000 and completed the acquisition on January 24, 2022. The acquisition of Hunter was financed primarily with a new $800,000 seven year Term Loan B facility; a combination of cash on hand and revolver borrowings was used to fund the balance of the purchase price and related acquisition and debt expenditures.\nOn September 27, 2021, Griffon announced it was exploring strategic alternatives for its Defense Electronics segment, which consisted of Telephonics Corporation (\"Telephonics\"), and on June 27, 2022, Griffon completed the sale of Telephonics to TTM for $330,000, excluding customary post-closing adjustments, primarily related to working capital. As a result, Griffon classified the results of operations of the Telephonics business as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operation as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets. All references made to results and information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to Griffon's continuing operations unless noted otherwise.\nOn December 22, 2020, AMES acquired Quatro Design Pty Ltd (Quatro), a leading Australian manufacturer and supplier of\nglass fiber reinforced concrete landscaping products for residential, commercial, and public sector projects.\nIn August 2020 Griffon Corporation completed the public offering of 8,700,000 shares of our common stock for total net proceeds of $178,165 (the \"Public Offering\"). The Company used a portion of the net proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under its Credit Agreement. The Company used the remainder of the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nDuring 2020, Griffon issued $1,000,000 of 5.75% Senior Notes due in 2028 (the 2028 Senior Notes) at par. Proceeds from the 2028 Senior Notes were used to redeem the $1,000,000 of 5.25% Senior Notes due 2022 (the \"2022 Senior Notes\").\nIn January 2020, Griffon amended its credit agreement to increase the total amount available for borrowing from $350,000 to $400,000, extend its maturity date from March 22, 2021 to March 22, 2025 and modify certain other provisions of the facility (the \"Credit Agreement\").\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non-US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nIn November 2019, Griffon announced the development of a next-generation business platform for CPP to enhance the growth, efficiency, and competitiveness of its U.S. operations, and on November 12, 2020, Griffon announced that CPP is broadening this strategic initiative to include additional North American facilities, the AMES United Kingdom (U.K.) and Australia businesses, and a manufacturing facility in China. On April 28, 2022, Griffon announced a reduced scope and an accelerated timeline for the initiative, which was completed in fiscal 2022. These changes reflect the rapid progress made with the initiative, and reduced investment in facilities expansion and equipment given recent significant increases in construction and equipment costs. Any remaining expenditures, after the end of fiscal 2022, including those related to the deployment of AMES' global information systems, will be included in the continuing operations of the business. Future investments in equipment, particularly for automation, will be part of normal-course annual capital expenditures.\nThis initiative included three key development areas. First, certain AMES U.S. and global operations were consolidated to optimize facilities footprint and talent. Second, strategic investments in automation and facilities expansion were made to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing and fulfillment operations, and support e-commerce growth. Third, multiple independent information systems were unified into a single data and analytics platform, which will serve the whole AMES global enterprise.\nThe cost to implement this new business platform, over the duration of the project, included one-time charges of approximately $51,869 and capital investments of approximately $15,000, net of future proceeds from the sale of exited facilities. Total cumulative charges of $51,869 consisted of cash charges totaling $35,691 and non-cash, asset-related charges totaling $16,178; the cash charges included $12,934 for one-time termination benefits and other personnel-related costs and $22,757 for facility exit costs.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. The health and safety of our employees, our customers and their families is always a high priority for Griffon. As of the date of this filing, all of Griffon's facilities are fully operational. When COVID-19 struck, we implemented a variety of new policies and procedures, including additional cleaning, social distancing, staggered shifts and prohibiting or significantly restricting on-site visitors, to minimize the risk to our employees of contracting COVID-19. While many of these precautions have been relaxed or eliminated as the health risk of COVID-19 has decreased, we would not hesitate to reinstitute and/or modify these policies and procedures as necessary should the health risk return to an unacceptable level. In such event, our suppliers could be required by government authorities to temporarily cease operations; might be limited in their production capacity due to complying with restrictions relating to the operation of businesses to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19; or could suffer their own supply chain disruptions, impacting their ability to continue to supply us with the quantity of materials required by us. While we are unable to determine or predict the nature, duration or scope of the overall impact COVID-19 will have on our businesses, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, we believe it is important to discuss where our company stands today, how we have responded (and will continue to respond) to COVID 19 and how our operations and financial condition may change as COVID-19 evolves. See information provided in Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Form 10-K\nGriffon currently conducts its operations through two reportable segments:\nConsumer and Professional Products (CPP) is a leading North American manufacturer and a global provider of branded consumer and professional tools; residential, industrial and commercial fans; home storage and organization products; and products that enhance indoor and outdoor lifestyles. CPP sells products globally through a portfolio of leading brands including AMES, since 1774, Hunter, since 1886, True Temper, and ClosetMaid.\nHome and Building Products (\"HBP\") conducts its operations through Clopay. Founded in 1964, Clopay is the largest manufacturer and marketer of garage doors and rolling steel doors in North America. Residential and commercial sectional garage doors are sold through professional dealers and leading home center retail chains throughout North America under the brands Clopay, Ideal, and Holmes. Rolling steel door and grille products designed for commercial, industrial, institutional, and retail use are sold under the Cornell and Cookson brands.\nConsolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Griffon and all subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included from the dates of acquisitions.\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non-US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nEarnings per share\nDue to rounding, the sum of earnings per share may not equal earnings per share of Net income.\nDiscontinued operations\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, discontinued operations includes the Telephonics business, and the assets and liabilities of discontinued installations business and other discontinued activities which have been segregated from Griffon's continuing operations primarily related to insurance claims, product liability, warranty and environmental reserves. See Note 8, Discontinued Operations.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates may be adjusted due to changes in economic, industry or customer financial conditions, as well as changes in technology or demand. Significant estimates include expected loss allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and returns, net realizable value of inventories, restructuring reserves, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, assumptions associated with pension benefit obligations and income or expenses, useful lives associated with depreciation and amortization of intangible and fixed assets, warranty reserves, sales incentive accruals, assumption associated with stock based compensation valuation, income taxes and tax valuation reserves, environmental reserves, legal reserves, insurance reserves, the valuation of assets and liabilities of discontinued operations, assumptions associated with valuation of acquired assets and assumed liabilities of acquired companies and the accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions Griffon may undertake in the future. Actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.\nCash and equivalents\nGriffon considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents primarily consist of overnight commercial paper, highly-rated liquid money market funds backed by U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Agency securities, as well as insured bank deposits. Griffon had cash in non-U.S. bank accounts of approximately $54,200 and $65,000 at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Substantially all U.S. cash and equivalents are in excess of FDIC insured limits. Griffon regularly evaluates the financial stability of all institutions and funds that hold its cash and equivalents.\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts and notes payable and revolving credit debt approximate fair value due to either the short-term nature of such instruments or the fact that the interest rate of the revolving credit debt is based upon current market rates.\nThe fair value hierarchy, as outlined in the applicable accounting guidance, establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instruments categorization within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The accounting guidance establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, as follows:\nLevel 1 inputs are measured and recorded at fair value based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.\nLevel 2 inputs include inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non-US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nthat are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe fair value of Griffons 2028 Senior Notes approximated $833,433, on September 30, 2022. Fair values were based upon quoted market prices (level 1 inputs).\nInsurance contracts with a value of $3,447 at September 30, 2022 are measured and recorded at fair value based upon quoted prices in active markets for similar assets (level 2 inputs) and are included in Other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, marketable debt and equity securities, measured at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets (level 2 inputs), with a fair value of $62 ($83 cost basis) and $16,044 ($15,050 cost basis), respectively, were included in Prepaid and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn the normal course of business, Griffons operations are exposed to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To manage these risks, Griffon may enter into various derivative contracts such as foreign currency exchange contracts, including forwards and options. Griffon entered into several such contracts in order to lock into a foreign currency rate for planned settlements of trade and inter-company liabilities payable in USD as discussed below.\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, Griffon had $25,000 and $20,000 of Australian dollar contracts at a weighted average rate of $1.42 and $1.27, respectively, which qualified for hedge accounting. These hedges were all deemed effective as cash flow hedges with gains and losses related to changes in fair value deferred and recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and Prepaid and other current assets, or Accrued liabilities, until settlement. Upon settlement, gains and losses were recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Cost of goods and services. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) included deferred gains of $2,017 ($1,412, net of tax) and deferred gains of $1,710 ($1,197, net of tax) at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Upon settlement gains/(losses) of $5,477 and $(2,204) were recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Cost of goods and services (\"COGS\") during 2022 and 2021, respectively. All contracts expire in 30 to 90 days.\nAt September 30, 2022, Griffon had $74,250 of Chinese Yuan contracts at a weighted average rate of $6.79, which qualified for hedge accounting (level 2 inputs). These hedges were all deemed effective as cash flow hedges with gains and losses related to changes in fair value deferred and recorded in AOCI and Prepaid and other current assets, or Accrued liabilities, until settlement. Upon settlement, gains and losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Cost of goods and services. AOCI included deferred losses of $3,179 ($2,320, net of tax) at September 30, 2022. Upon settlement, losses of $736 were recorded in COGS during 2022. All contracts expire in 11 to 396 days.\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, Griffon had $6,300 and $4,600, respectively, of Canadian dollar contracts at a weighted average rate of $1.28 and $1.26, respectively. These contracts, which protect Canadian operations from currency fluctuations for U.S. dollar based purchases, do not qualify for hedge accounting and fair value gains of $427 and $38 were recorded in Other assets and to Other income for the outstanding contracts, based on similar contract values (level 2 inputs), for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Realized gains (losses) of $247 and $(381) were recorded in Other income during 2022 and 2021, respectively. All contracts expire in 3 to 390 days.\nPension plan assets with a fair value of $144,091 at September 30, 2022, are measured and recorded at fair value based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (level 1 inputs), quoted market prices for similar assets (level 2 inputs) and fair value assumptions for unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists (level 3).\nThe Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method, in which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition using a method substantially similar to the goodwill impairment test\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non-US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nmethodology (level 3 inputs). The operating results of the acquired companies are included in Griffons consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition in each instance.\nNon-U.S. currency translation\nAssets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries, where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, have been translated at year-end exchange rates and profit and loss accounts have been translated using weighted average exchange rates during the applicable fiscal year. Adjustments resulting from currency translation are recorded in AOCI as cumulative translation adjustments. The Company recognized cumulative translation losses of $37,920 during 2022 and gains of $6,433 during 2021. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the cumulative foreign currency translation recorded in AOCI was a loss of $57,170 and $19,250, respectively. Assets and liabilities of an entity that are denominated in currencies other than that entitys functional currency are re-measured into the functional currency using period end exchange rates, or historical rates where applicable to certain balances. Gains and losses arising on remeasurements are recorded within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income as a component of Other income (expense).\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations identified under the terms of contracts with its customers are satisfied. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a bundle of goods or services, to the customer, and is the unit of accounting. A contract with a customer is an agreement which both parties have approved, that creates enforceable rights and obligations, has commercial substance and with respect to which payment terms are identified and collectability is probable. Once the Company has entered into a contract or purchase order, it is evaluated to identify performance obligations. For each performance obligation, revenue is recognized when control of the promised products is transferred to the customer, or services are satisfied under the contract or purchase order, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services (the transaction price).\nThe Companys performance obligations are recognized at a point in time related to the manufacture and sale of a broad range of products and components, and revenue is recognized when title, and risk and rewards of ownership, have transferred to the customer, which is generally upon shipment.\nRefer to Note 2 - Revenue for more detail.\nAccounts receivable, expected loss allowance for doubtful accounts and concentrations of credit risk\nAccounts receivable is composed principally of trade accounts receivable, that arise from the sale of goods or services on account, and is stated at historical cost. A substantial portion of Griffons trade receivables are from Home Depot, whose financial condition is dependent on the construction and related retail sectors of the economy. As a percentage of consolidated accounts receivable, Home Depot was 17%. Griffon performs continuing evaluations of the financial condition of its customers, and although Griffon generally does not require collateral, letters of credit may be required from customers in certain circumstances.\nTrade receivables are recorded at the stated amount, less expected loss allowance for doubtful accounts and, when appropriate, for customer program reserves and cash discounts. The expected loss allowance represents estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations (usually due to customers potential insolvency). The expected loss allowance for doubtful accounts includes amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified, as well as an amount for customer defaults based on a formula when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. The provision related to the expected loss allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses. The Company writes-off accounts receivable when they are deemed to be uncollectible.\nCustomer program reserves and cash discounts are netted against accounts receivable when it is customer practice to reduce invoices for these amounts. The amounts netted against accounts receivable in 2022 and 2021 were $69,656 and $49,833, respectively.\nAll accounts receivable amounts are expected to be collected in less than one year.\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non-US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nThe Company does not currently have customers or contracts that prescribe specific retainage provisions.\nInventories\nInventories, stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out or average) or net realizable value, include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs.\nGriffons businesses typically do not require inventory that is susceptible to becoming obsolete or dated. In general, HBP produces residential and commercial sectional garage doors, commercial rolling steel door and grille products, and CPP produces long-handled tools and landscaping products, and storage and organizational products, both in response to orders from customers of retailers and dealers or based on expected orders, as applicable.\nLong-Lived Assets, Including Intangible Assets\nProperty, plant and equipment includes the historical cost of land, buildings, equipment and significant improvements to existing plant and equipment or, in the case of acquisitions, a fair market value appraisal of such assets completed at the time of acquisition. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When property or equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the respective accounts and the gain or loss is recognized.\nDepreciation expense, which includes amortization of assets under capital leases, was $46,443, $42,741 and $42,614 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and was calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation included in SG&A expenses was $16,683, $14,362 and $13,944 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The remaining components of depreciation, attributable to manufacturing operations, are included in Cost of goods and services. Estimated useful lives for property, plant and equipment are as follows: buildings and building improvements, 25 to 40 years; machinery and equipment, 2 to 15 years; and leasehold improvements, over the term of the lease or life of the improvement, whichever is shorter.\nCapitalized interest costs included in Property, plant and equipment were $1,739, $1,592 and $2,098 for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The original cost of fully-depreciated property, plant and equipment remaining in use at September 30, 2022 was approximately $274,783.\nLong-lived assets, including customer relationships and software, and tangible assets, primarily property, plant and equipment, are amortized over their expected useful lives, which involve significant assumptions and estimates. We assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of such assets based on the expectations of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset group. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, a loss would be recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we tested long-lived intangible and tangible assets for impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted cash flows of each CPP asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group and determined that an impairment did not exist. No event or indicator of impairment existed for the HBP assets groups.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, and more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below the carrying amount. Such events or changes in circumstance include significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate in which our reporting units operate, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, when some portion of a reporting unit is disposed of or classified as held for sale, or when a change in the composition of reporting units occurs for other reasons, such as a change in operating segments. To test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we may perform both a qualitative assessment and quantitative assessment. If we elect to perform a\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non-US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nqualitative assessment, we consider operating results as well as circumstances impacting the operations or cash flows of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions and reporting unit events and circumstances. For the quantitative test, the assessment is based on both an income-based and market-based valuation approach. If it is determined that an impairment exists, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value.\nFair value estimates are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Any changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects, which may result from a decline in Griffons stock price, a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of Griffons control, or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of Griffons reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we performed a qualitative assessment of the HBP reporting unit and determined that indicators that the fair value was less than the carrying amount were not present. However, indicators of impairment were present for our CPP reporting units driven by a decrease in comparable company market multiples and an increase in interest rates and the related impact on weighted average cost of capital rates. As such, in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we performed a quantitative assessment of the CPP reporting units using both an income-based and market-based approach. The impairment tests resulted in a pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $342,027. Further, we compared the estimated fair values of the CPP indefinite lived intangibles to their carrying values which resulted in a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $175,000.\nLeases\nOn October 1, 2019, the Company adopted the Accounting Standards Codifications (\"ASC\") Topic 842, Leases, which requires the recording of operating lease Right-of-Use (\"ROU\") assets and operating lease liabilities. Finance leases were not impacted by the adoption of ASC Topic 842, as finance lease liabilities and the corresponding assets were already recorded in the balance sheet under the previous guidance, ASC Topic 840. The Company has elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allows us to carry forward the historical lease classification. We also elected a practical expedient to determine the reasonably certain lease term.\nThe Company applied the modified retrospective approach, whereby the cumulative effect of adoption is recognized as of the date of adoption and comparative prior periods are not retrospectively adjusted. As a result, upon adoption, we recognized ROU assets of $163,552 and lease liabilities of $163,676 associated with our operating leases. The standard had no material impact to retained earnings or on our Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. For leases existing as of October 1, 2019, we have elected to use the remaining lease term as of the adoption date in determining the incremental borrowing rate. Our determination of the lease term may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The ROU assets and short and long-term liabilities associated with our operating leases are shown as separate line items on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant, and equipment, net, other accrued liabilities, and other non-current liabilities.\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non-US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nFor operating leases, fixed lease payments are recognized as operating lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases and impaired operating leases, the ROU asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term, along with recognition of interest expense associated with accretion of the lease liability. For leases with a lease term of 12 months or less (a \"Short-term\" lease), any fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over such term, and are not recognized on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Variable lease cost for both operating and finance leases, if any, is recognized as incurred. The Company has lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, we account for lease components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance).\nDefinite-lived long-lived assets\nAmortizable intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. For financial reporting purposes, definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, generally eight to twenty-five years. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.\nThere were no indicators of impairment during the three years ending September 30, 2022.\nIncome taxes\nWe are subject to Federal, state and local income taxes in the U.S. and in various taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns in accordance with applicable accounting guidance for accounting for income taxes, using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.\nWe record a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Both positive and negative evidence are considered in forming our judgment as to whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, and more weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. Valuation allowances are reassessed whenever there are changes in circumstances that may cause a change in judgment.\nThe accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record, as needed, a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made.\nResearch and development costs, shipping and handling costs and advertising costs\nResearch and development costs are charged to SG&A expense as incurred and amounted to approximately $16,000 in 2022, $7,000 in 2021 and $8,000 in 2020.\nTotal shipping and handling costs were $130,830 in 2022, $113,700 in 2021 and $100,135 in 2020, of which $69,000 in 2022, $58,100 in 2021 and $54,500 in 2020 were included in SG&A. Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred in SG&A, was $22,000 in 2022, $19,000 in 2021 and $18,000 in 2020.\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non-US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nRisk, retention and insurance\nGriffons property and casualty insurance programs contain various deductibles that, based on Griffons experience, are reasonable and customary for a company of its size and risk profile. Griffon generally maintains deductibles for claims and liabilities related primarily to workers compensation, general, product and automobile liability as well as property damage and business interruption losses resulting from certain events. Griffon does not consider any of the deductibles to represent a material risk to Griffon. Griffon accrues for claim exposures that are probable of occurrence and can be reasonably estimated. Insurance is maintained to transfer risk beyond the level of self-retention and provides protection on both an individual claim and annual aggregate basis.\nPension benefits\nGriffon sponsors defined and supplemental benefit pension plans for certain retired employees. Annual amounts relating to these plans are recorded based on actuarial projections, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases and turnover rates. Actuarial assumptions used to determine pension liabilities, assets and expense are reviewed annually and modified based on current economic conditions and trends. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the nature of the plan's investments and expectations for long-term rates of return. The discount rate used to measure obligations is based on a corporate bond spot-rate yield curve that matches projected future benefit payments, with the appropriate spot rate applicable to the timing of the projected future benefit payments. Assumptions used in determining Griffons obligations under the defined benefit pension plans are believed to be reasonable, based on experience and advice from independent actuaries; however, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially impact Griffons financial position or results of operations.\nAll of the defined benefit plans are frozen and have ceased accruing benefits.\nThe Companys non-service cost components of net periodic benefit plan cost was a benefit of $4,256, $907 and $1,559 during 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively.\nIssued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805); Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. This new guidance affects all entities that enter into a business combination within the scope of ASC 805-10. Under this new guidance, the acquirer should determine what contract assets and/or liabilities it would have recorded under ASC 606 (Revenue Guidance) as of the acquisition date, as if the acquirer had entered into the original contract at the same date and on the same terms as the acquirer. Under current U.S. GAAP, contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded by the acquirer at fair value. This update is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNew Accounting Standards Implemented\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued guidance on simplifying the accounting for income taxes by clarifying and amending existing guidance related to the recognition of franchise tax, the evaluation of a step up in the tax basis of goodwill, and the effects of enacted changes in tax laws or rates in the effective tax rate computation, among other clarifications. This guidance became effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2022. We adopted the recognition of non-income taxes on the modified retrospective basis. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued guidance to clarify disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted, and was effective for the Company in our fiscal year beginning October 1, 2021. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures.\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non-US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nThe Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements, and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.\nNOTE 2 - REVENUE\nThe Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations identified under the terms of contracts with its customers are satisfied. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a bundle of goods or services, to the customer, and is the unit of accounting. A contract with a customer is an agreement which both parties have approved, that creates enforceable rights and obligations, has commercial substance and with respect to which payment terms are identified and collectability is probable. Once the Company has entered into a contract or purchase order, it is evaluated to identify performance obligations. For each performance obligation, revenue is recognized when control of the promised products is transferred to the customer, or services are satisfied under the contract or purchase order, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services (the transaction price).\nA contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. A majority of the Companys contracts have a single performance obligation which represents, in most cases, the product being sold to the customer. To a lesser extent, some contracts include multiple performance obligations such as a product, the related installation, and extended warranty services. These contracts require judgment in determining the number of performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these contacts are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes. In these types of contracts, the Company allocates the total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. The Company uses an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price for separate performance obligations or a cost plus margin approach when one is not available. The transaction price includes variable consideration, such as discounts and volume rebates, when it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognized will not occur. Variable consideration is determined using either the expected value or the most likely amount of consideration to be received based on historical experience and the specific facts and circumstances at the time of evaluation.\nSee Note 18 - Business Segments for revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by end markets, segments and geographic location.\nThe Companys performance obligations are recognized at a point in time related to the manufacture and sale of a broad range of products and components and revenue is recognized when title, and risk and rewards of ownership, have transferred to the customer, which is generally upon shipment.\nA majority of the Company's revenue is short cycle in nature with shipments occurring within one year from order and does not include a material long-term financing component, implicitly or explicitly. Payment terms generally range between 15 to 90 days and vary by the location of the business, the type of products manufactured to be sold and the volume of products sold, among other factors.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when all factors are met, including when control of a product transfers to the customer upon its shipment, completion of installation, testing, certification or other substantive acceptance required under the contract. Other than standard product warranty provisions, sales arrangements provide for no other significant post-shipment obligations on the Company. From time-to-time and for certain customers, rebates and other sales incentives, promotional allowances or discounts are offered, typically related to customer purchase volumes, all of which are fixed or determinable and are classified as a reduction of revenue and recorded at the time of sale. Griffon provides for sales returns and allowances based upon historical returns experience. The Company includes shipping costs billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs in either Cost of Goods and Services or Selling, General and Administrative expenses.\nThe majority of the Companys contracts offer assurance-type warranties in connection with the sale of a product to a customer. Assurance-type warranties provide a customer with assurance that the related product will function as the parties intended because it complies with agreed-upon specifications. Such warranties do not represent a separate performance obligation.\nPayment terms vary depending on the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. Generally, the period between the time revenue is recognized and the time payment is due is not significant. Shipping and handling charges\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non-US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nare not considered a separate performance obligation. Additionally, all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected from a customer (e.g., sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes) are excluded from revenue.\nNOTE 3 - ACQUISITIONS\nGriffon continually evaluates potential acquisitions that either strategically fit within its portfolio or expand its portfolio into new product lines or adjacent markets. Griffon has completed a number of acquisitions that have been accounted for as business combinations, in which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition and have resulted in the recognition of goodwill. The operating results of the business acquisitions are included in Griffons consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.\nOn December 17, 2021, Griffon entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Hunter, a market leader in residential ceiling, commercial, and industrial fans, from MidOcean for a contractual purchase price of $845,000 and completed the acquisition on January 24, 2022. The acquisition was primarily financed with a new $800,000 seven year Term Loan B facility; we used a combination of cash on hand and revolver borrowings to fund the balance of the purchase price and related acquisition and debt expenditures. Hunter complements and diversifies Griffon's portfolio of leading consumer brands and products. Since the date of acquisition through September 30, 2022, Hunter's revenue and Segment Adjusted EBITDA was $246,474 and $43,579, respectively. The goodwill recognized was $258,536, which was assigned to the CPP segment, and is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The final purchase price allocation, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, will be based on final appraisals and other analysis of fair values of acquired assets and liabilities. The following unaudited proforma summary from continuing operations presents consolidated information as if the Company acquired Hunter on October 1, 2020:\nProforma For the Year Ended September 30, (unaudited)\n2022 2021\nRevenue $ 2,938,998 $ 2,624,378\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations (288,062) 77,804\nGriffon did not include any material, nonrecurring proforma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination in the proforma revenue and earnings.

The guidance requires companies to consider forward-looking information to estimate expected credit losses, resulting in earlier recognition of losses for receivables that are current or not yet due, which were not considered under the previous accounting guidance.\nThe Company is exposed to credit losses primarily through sales of products and services. Trade receivables are recorded at their stated amount, less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. The Companys expected loss allowance methodology for trade receivables is primarily based on the aging method of the accounts receivables balances and the financial condition of its customers. The allowances represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations (usually due to customers potential insolvency), discounts related to early payment of accounts receivables by customers and estimates for returns. The allowance for doubtful accounts includes amounts for certain customers in which a risk of default has been specifically identified, as well as an amount for customer defaults, based on a formula, when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. Allowance for discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue and the provision related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in SG&A expenses.\nThe Company also considers current and expected future economic and market conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, when determining any estimate of credit losses. Generally, estimates used to determine the allowance are based on assessment of anticipated payment and all other historical, current and future information that is reasonably available. All accounts receivable amounts are expected to be collected in less than one year.\nBased on a review of the Company's policies and procedures across all segments, including the aging of its trade receivables, recent write-off history and other factors related to future macroeconomic conditions, Griffon determined that its method to determine credit losses and the amount of its allowances for bad debts is in accordance with this guidance in all material respects.\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non-US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nThe following table provides a roll-forward of the allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of accounts receivable to present the net amount expected to be collected:\nBeginning Balance, October 1, 2020 $ 8,178\nProvision for expected credit losses 795\nAmounts written off charged against the allowance (393)\nOther, primarily foreign currency translation 207\nEnding Balance, September 30, 2021 $ 8,787\nAllowance for credit losses acquired 2,598\nProvision for expected credit losses 1,172\nAmounts written off charged against the allowance (251)\nOther, primarily foreign currency translation (169)\nEnding Balance, September 30, 2022 $ 12,137\nNOTE 7 - GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we performed a qualitative assessment of the HBP reporting unit and determined that indicators that the fair value was less than the carrying amount were not present. However, indicators of impairment were present for our CPP reporting units driven by a decrease in comparable company market multiples and an increase in interest rates and the related impact on weighted average cost of capital rates. As such, in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we performed a quantitative assessment of the CPP reporting units using both an income based and market-based valuation approach. The impairment tests resulted in a pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $342,027 to the CPP reporting units.\nThe following table provides changes in carrying value of goodwill by segment through the year ended September 30, 2022:\nAt September 30,\n2020 Goodwill from acquisitions (a) Foreign currency translation adjustments At September 30,\n2021 Goodwill from acquisitions (a) Accumulated Impairment Charges Foreign currency translation adjustments At September 30,\nConsumer and Professional Products $ 232,845 $ 784 $ 1,266 $ 234,895 $ 258,536 $ (342,027) $ (6,867) $ 144,537\nHome and Building Products 191,253 - - 191,253 - - - 191,253\nTotal $ 424,098 $ 784 $ 1,266 $ 426,148 $ 258,536 $ (342,027) $ (6,867) $ 335,790\n(a) The increase in the CPP segment was due to the acquisitions of Hunter in 2022 and Quatro in 2021.\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non-US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nIn connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, indicators of impairment were present for our CPP indefinite-lived intangible assets. As such, we determined the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets by using the relief from royalty method, which estimates the value of a trademark by discounting to present value the hypothetical royalty payments that are saved by owning the asset rather than licensing it. We compared the estimated fair values to their carrying amounts. The impairment tests resulted in a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $175,000 to the gross carrying amount of our Trademarks. The following table provides the gross carrying value and accumulated amortization for each major class of intangible asset:\nAt September 30, 2022 At September 30, 2021\nGross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Average\nLife\n(Years) Gross Carrying\nAmount Accumulated Amortization\nCustomer relationships & other $ 442,085 $ 91,143 23 $ 187,732 $ 75,794\nUnpatented technology 14,326 3,022 13 13,429 2,439\nTotal amortizable intangible assets 456,411 94,165 201,161 78,233\nTrademarks 399,668 - 227,097 -\nTotal intangible assets $ 856,079 $ 94,165 $ 428,258 $ 78,233\nThe gross carrying amount of intangible assets was impacted by $14,234 related to foreign currency translation.\nAmortization expense for intangible assets subject to amortization was $18,215, $9,561 and $9,486 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in amortization expense in 2022 compared to the prior year was related to Intangible assets acquired in connection with the Hunter acquisition. Amortization expense for each of the next five years and thereafter, based on current intangible balances and classifications, is estimated as follows: 2023 - $21,785; 2024 - $21,305; 2025 - $21,305; 2026 - $21,305 and 2027 - $21,305; thereafter - $255,241.\nNOTE 8 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nOn September 27, 2021, Griffon announced it was exploring strategic alternatives for its DE segment, which consisted of its Telephonics subsidiary. On June 27, 2022, Griffon completed the sale of Telephonics to TTM for $330,000 in cash, excluding customary post-closing adjustments, primarily related to working capital. In connection with the sale of Telephonics, the Company recorded a gain of $107,517 ($89,241, net of tax) for the year ended September 30, 2022. The gain and related tax for the sale of Telephonics is preliminary and is subject to finalization.\nIn accordance with ASC 205-20 Presentation of Financial Statements: Discontinued Operations, a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results when the component of an entity meets the criteria in paragraph 205-20-45-10. In the period in which the component meets held-for-sale or discontinued operations criteria the major current assets, other assets, current liabilities, and noncurrent liabilities shall be reported as components of total assets and liabilities separate from those balances of the continuing operations. At the same time, the results of all discontinued operations, less applicable income taxes (benefit), shall be reported as components of net income (loss) separate from the net income (loss) of continuing operations.\nDefense Electronics (DE or Telephonics)\nThe following amounts related to Telephonics have been segregated from Griffon's continuing operations and are reported as discontinued operations:\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non-US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nRevenue $ 161,061 $ 271,060 $ 340,976\nCost of goods and services 125,208 232,075 285,022\nGross profit 35,853 38,985 55,954\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 26,423 35,532 42,314\nIncome from discontinued operations 9,430 3,453 13,640\nOther income (expense)\nGain on sale of business 107,517 5,291 -\nInterest income, net 2 117 4\nOther, net (604) 1,260 1,632\nTotal other income (expense) 106,915 6,668 1,636\nIncome from discontinued operations before tax $ 116,345 $ 10,121 $ 15,276\nProvision for income taxes 20,188 1212 3,291\nIncome from discontinued operations 96,157 8,909 11,985\nDepreciation and amortization was excluded from the current year results since DE was classified as a discontinued operation and, accordingly, the Company ceased depreciation and amortization in accordance with discontinued operations accounting guidelines.

The increase in assets and liabilities for Installations Services and other discontinued operations was primarily associated with insurance claims receivable and payable.\nExcept for revenue from the Telephonics business, as noted above, there was no reported revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020 for Installations Services and other discontinued operations.\nNOTE 9 - ACCRUED LIABILITIES\nThe following table details the components of accrued liabilities:\nAt September 30,\n2022 At September 30,\nCompensation $ 77,823 $ 72,982\nInterest 6,798 4,156\nWarranties and rebates 18,965 11,529\nInsurance 10,533 10,390\nRent, utilities and freight 7,571 10,333\nIncome and other taxes 22,570 11,091\nMarketing and advertising 6,682 4,665\nRestructuring 650 682\nOther 20,205 19,100\nTotal $ 171,797 $ 144,928\nNOTE 10 - RESTRUCTURING CHARGES\nIn November 2019, Griffon announced the development of a next-generation business platform for CPP to enhance the growth, efficiency, and competitiveness of its U.S. operations, and on November 12, 2020, Griffon announced that CPP was broadening this strategic initiative to include additional North American facilities, the AMES United Kingdom (U.K.) and Australia businesses, and a manufacturing facility in China. On April 28, 2022, Griffon announced a reduced scope and an accelerated timeline for the initiative, which was completed in fiscal 2022. These changes reflect the rapid progress made with the initiative, and reduced investment in facilities expansion and equipment given recent significant increases in construction and\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nequipment costs. Any remaining expenditures, after the end of fiscal 2022, including those related to the deployment of AMES' global information systems, will be included in the continuing operations of the business. Future investments in equipment, particularly for automation, will be part of normal-course annual capital expenditures.\nThis initiative included three key development areas. First, certain AMES U.S. and global operations were consolidated to optimize facilities footprint and talent. Second, strategic investments in automation and facilities expansion were made to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing and fulfillment operations, and support e-commerce growth. Third, multiple independent information systems were unified into a single data and analytics platform, which will serve the whole AMES global enterprise.\nThe cost to implement this new business platform, over the duration of the project, included one-time charges of approximately $51,869 and capital investments of approximately $15,000, net of future proceeds from the sale of exited facilities. Total cumulative charges of $51,869 consisted of cash charges totaling $35,691 and non-cash, asset-related charges totaling $16,178; the cash charges included $12,934 for one-time termination benefits and other personnel-related costs and $22,757 for facility exit costs. As a result of these transactions, headcount was reduced by approximately 420.\nIn the year ended September 30, 2022, CPP incurred pre-tax restructuring and related exit costs approximating $16,782. Cash charges totaled $11,951 and non-cash, asset-related charges totaled $4,831; the cash charges included $4,124 for one-time termination benefits and other personnel related costs and $7,827 for facility exit costs.

Proceeds from the 2028 Senior Notes were used to redeem the $1,000,000 of 5.25% Senior Notes due 2022 (the \"2022 Senior Notes\"). In connection with the issuance and exchange of the 2028 Senior Notes, Griffon capitalized $16,448 of underwriting fees and other expenses incurred, which will amortize over the term of such notes. Additionally, during 2020 Griffon recognized a $7,925 loss on the early extinguishment of debt of the 2022 Senior Notes, comprised primarily of the write-off of $6,725 of remaining deferred financing fees, $607 of tender offer net premium expense and $593 of redemption interest expense. Furthermore, all of the obligations associated with the 2022 Senior Notes were discharged.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, Griffon purchased $25,225 of 2028 Senior Notes in the open market at a weighted average discount of 91.82% of par, or $23,161. In connection with these purchases, Griffon recognized a $1,767 net gain on the early extinguishment of debt comprised of $2,064 of face value in excess of purchase price, offset by $297 related to the write-off of underwriting fees and other expenses. As of September 30, 2022, outstanding 2028 Senior Notes due totaled $974,775; interest is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1.\nThe 2028 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Griffon guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries, and subject to certain covenants, limitations and restrictions. The 2028 Senior Notes were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") via an exchange offer. The fair value of the 2028 Senior Notes approximated $833,433 on September 30, 2022 based upon quoted market prices (level 1 inputs). At September 30, 2022, $10,939 of underwriting fees and other expenses incurred remained to be amortized.\n(b) On January 24, 2022, Griffon amended and restated its Revolving Credit Facility (as amended, \"Credit Agreement\") to provide for a new $800,000 Term Loan B facility, due January 24, 2029, in addition to its current $400,000 revolving credit facility (\"Revolver\"), and replaced LIBOR with SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate). The Term Loan B contains a SOFR floor of 0.50% and a current spread of 2.50%. Additionally, there are two interest rate step-downs tied to achieving decreased secured leverage ratio thresholds, the first of which was achieved during the year ended September 30, 2022. The Original Issue Discount for the Term Loan B was 99.75%. In connection with this amendment, Griffon capitalized $15,466 of underwriting fees and other expenses incurred, which are being amortized over the term of the loan.\nThe Term Loan B facility requires nominal quarterly principal payments of $2,000, which began with the quarter ended June 30, 2022; potential additional annual principal payments based on a percentage of excess cash flow and certain secured leverage thresholds starting with the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023; and a final balloon payment due at maturity. Term Loan B borrowings may generally be repaid without penalty but may not be re-borrowed. During the year ended September 30, 2022, Griffon prepaid $300,000 aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan B, which permanently reduced the outstanding balance. In connection with the prepayment of the Term Loan B Griffon recognized a $6,296 charge on the prepayment of debt, $5,575 related to the write-off of underwriting fees and other expenses and $721 of the\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\noriginal issue discount. The Term Loan B facility is subject to the same affirmative and negative covenants that apply to the Revolver, but is not subject to any financial maintenance covenants. Term Loan B borrowings are secured by the same collateral as the Revolver. The fair value of the Term Loan B facility approximated $476,160 on September 30, 2022 based upon quoted market prices (level 1 inputs). At September 30, 2022, $8,823 of underwriting fees and other expenses incurred, remained to be amortized.\nThe Revolver's maximum borrowing availability is $400,000 and it matures on March 22, 2025. The Revolver includes a letter of credit sub-facility with a limit of $100,000; a multi-currency sub-facility of $200,000; and contains a customary accordion feature that permits us to request, subject to each lender's consent, an increase in the maximum aggregate amount that can be borrowed by up to an additional $100,000.\nIn addition, on December 9, 2021, Griffon replaced the Revolver GBP LIBOR benchmark rate with a Sterling Overnight Index Average (\"SONIA\"). Borrowings under the Revolver may be repaid and re-borrowed at any time. Interest is payable on borrowings at either a SOFR, SONIA or base rate benchmark rate, plus an applicable margin, which adjusts based on financial performance. Current margins are 0.50% for base rate loans, 1.50% for SOFR loans and 1.50% for SONIA loans. The Revolver has certain financial maintenance tests including a maximum total leverage ratio, a maximum senior secured leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The negative covenants place limits on Griffon's ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, and make restricted payments and investments. Both the Revolver and Term Loan B borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Griffons material domestic subsidiaries and are secured, on a first priority basis, by substantially all domestic assets of the Company and the guarantors, and a pledge of not greater than 65% of the equity interest in Griffons material, first-tier foreign subsidiaries. At September 30, 2022, under the Credit Agreement, there were $97,328 in outstanding borrowings; outstanding standby letters of credit were $12,287; and $290,385 was available, subject to certain loan covenants, for borrowing at that date.\n(c) Griffon has one finance lease outstanding for real estate located in Ocala, Florida. The lease matures in 2025 and bears interest at a fixed rate of approximately 5.6%. The Ocala, Florida lease contains two five-year renewal options. At September 30, 2022, $13,091 was outstanding. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the financing lease on the Troy, Ohio location expired. The lease bore interest at a rate of approximately 5.0%, was secured by a mortgage on the real estate, which was guaranteed by Griffon, and had a one dollar buyout at the end of the lease. Griffon exercised the one dollar buyout option in November 2021. Refer to Note 21- Leases for further details.\n(d) In November 2012, Garant G.P. (Garant), a Griffon wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a CAD 15,000 ($10,956 as of September 30, 2022) revolving credit facility. The facility accrues interest at LIBOR (USD) or the Bankers Acceptance Rate (CDN) plus 1.3% per annum (4.44% LIBOR USD and 4.76% Bankers Acceptance Rate CDN as of September 30, 2022). In October 2022 the revolving facility was amended and matures in October 2024 and is renewable upon mutual agreement with the lender. Garant is required to maintain a certain minimum equity. As of September 30, 2022, there were no borrowings under this revolving credit facility with CAD 15,000 ($10,956 as of September 30, 2022) available for borrowing.\nIn March 2022, Griffon Australia Holdings Pty Ltd and its Australian subsidiaries (collectively, \"Griffon Australia\") amended its AUD 18,375 term loan, AUD 20,000 revolver and AUD 15,000 receivable purchase facility agreement that was entered into in July 2016 and further amended in fiscal 2020. Griffon Australia paid off the term loan in the amount of AUD 9,625 and canceled the AUD 20,000 revolver. The amendment refinanced the existing AUD 15,000 receivable purchase facility. The receivable purchase facility matures in March 2023 and is renewable upon mutual agreement with the lender. The receivable purchase facility accrues interest at BBSY (Bank Bill Swap Rate) plus 1.25% per annum (3.96% at September 30, 2022). At September 30, 2022, there was no balance outstanding under the receivable purchase facility with AUD $15,000 ($9,722 as of September 30, 2022) available. The receivable purchase facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of Griffon Australia and its subsidiaries. Griffon Australia is required to maintain a certain minimum equity level.\nIn July 2018, the AMES Companies UK Ltd and its subsidiaries (collectively, \"Ames UK\") entered into a GBP 14,000 term loan, GBP 4,000 mortgage loan and GBP 5,000 revolver. The term loan and mortgage loan require quarterly principal payments of GBP 438 and GBP 105 plus interest, respectively, and have balloon payments due upon maturity, July 2023,\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nof GBP 7,088 and GBP 2,349, respectively. Effective in January 2022, the Term Loan and Mortgage Loan were amended to replace GBP LIBOR with SONIA. The term loan and mortgage loan each accrue interest at the SONIA Rate plus 1.80% (3.99% as of September 30, 2022). The revolver accrues interest at the Bank of England Base Rate plus 3.25% (5.50% as of September 30, 2022). The revolver matures in July 2023, and is renewable upon mutual agreement with the lender. As of September 30, 2022, the revolver had no outstanding balance, and the term and mortgage loan balances were GBP 11,060 ($12,090 as of September 30, 2022). The revolver and the term loan are both secured by substantially all the assets of AMES UK and its subsidiaries. The mortgage loan is secured by the underlying property. AMES UK is subject to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charges cover ratio.\n(e) Other long-term debt primarily consists of a loan with the Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority, with the balance consisting of finance leases.\nAt September 30, 2022, Griffon and its subsidiaries were in compliance with the terms and covenants of its credit and loan agreements.\nNOTE 13 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nGriffon offers defined contribution plans to most of its U.S. employees. In addition to employee contributions to the plans, Griffon makes contributions based upon various percentages of compensation and/or employee contributions, which were $11,080 in 2022, $8,576 in 2021 and $6,855 in 2020.\nThe Company also provides healthcare and life insurance benefits for certain groups of retirees through several plans. For certain employees, the benefits are at fixed amounts per retiree and are partially contributory by the retiree. The post-retirement benefit obligation was $1,796 and $1,678 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. The accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for these plans was $399 and ($118) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the 2022 and 2021 benefit expense was $47 and $35, respectively. It is the Companys practice to fund these benefits as incurred.\nGriffon also has qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans covering certain employees which provide benefits based on years of service and employee compensation. Over time, these amounts will be recognized as part of net periodic pension costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nGriffon is responsible for overseeing the management of the investments of two qualified defined benefit plan and uses the services of an investment manager to manage the plans' assets based on agreed upon risk profiles. The primary objective of the qualified defined benefit plan is to secure participant retirement benefits. As such, the key objective in this plans financial management is to promote stability and, to the extent appropriate, growth in the funded status. Financial objectives are established in conjunction with a review of current and projected plan financial requirements. The fair values of a majority of the plan assets were determined by the plans trustee using quoted market prices for identical instruments (level 1 inputs) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. The fair value of various other investments was determined by the plans' trustees using direct observable market corroborated inputs, including quoted market prices for similar assets (level 2 inputs). A small amount of plan assets are invested in private equity which consist primarily of investments in private companies which are valued using the net asset values provided by the underlying private investment companies as a practical expedient (level 3 inputs).\nThe Clopay AMES Pension Plan, the Hunter Fan Pension Plan and the AMES supplemental executive retirement plan are frozen to new entrants and participants in the plans no longer accrue benefits.\nThe Companys non-service cost components of net periodic benefit plan cost was a benefit of $4,256, $907 and $1,559 during 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively.\nGriffon uses judgment to establish the assumptions used in determining the future liability of the plan, as well as the investment returns on the plan assets. The expected return on assets assumption used for pension expense was developed through analysis of historical market returns, current market conditions and past experience of plan investments. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected average rate of earnings on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. The assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term asset allocation of plan assets and the historical return. The discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality bonds with maturities matching the plans expected benefit payment stream. The\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non-US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nplans expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year-by-year spot rates. A 10% change in the discount rate or return on assets would not have a material effect on the financial statements of Griffon.\nNet periodic costs (benefits) were as follows:\nDefined Benefits for the Years Ended\nSeptember 30, Supplemental Benefits for the Years\nEnded September 30,\n2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nNet periodic (benefits) costs:\nInterest cost $ 3,448 $ 2,816 $ 4,267 $ 172 $ 162 $ 335\nExpected return on plan assets (11,255) (10,177) (10,343) - - -\nAmortization of:\nPrior service costs - - - - - 14\nActuarial loss 2,818 5,776 3,769 561 516 399\nTotal net periodic (benefits) costs $ (4,989) $ (1,585) $ (2,307) $ 733 $ 678 $ 748\nThe tax benefits in 2022, 2021 and 2020 for the amortization of pension costs in Other comprehensive income (loss) were $280, $270 and $878, respectively.\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in determining the net periodic (benefits) costs were as follows:\nDefined Benefits for the Years Ended\nSeptember 30, Supplemental Benefits for the Years\nEnded September 30,\n2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nDiscount rate 2.63 % 2.30 % 2.92 % 1.94 % 1.69 % 2.64 %\nExpected return on assets 6.72 % 6.75 % 7.00 % - % - % - %\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non-US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nPlan assets and benefit obligation of the defined and supplemental benefit plans were as follows:\nDefined Benefits at\nSeptember 30, Supplemental Benefits at\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nChange in benefit obligation:\nBenefit obligation at beginning of fiscal year $ 170,505 $ 183,003 $ 14,775 $ 16,070\nBusiness acquisition 21,839 - - -\nInterest cost 3,448 2,816 172 162\nBenefits paid (11,281) (10,743) (1,927) (1,936)\nActuarial (gain) loss (35,490) (4,571) (1,098) 479\nBenefit obligation at end of fiscal year 149,021 170,505 11,922 14,775\nChange in plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of fiscal year 160,523 147,145 - -\nBusiness acquisition 22,288 - - -\nActual return on plan assets (27,439) 23,199 - -\nCompany contributions - 922 1,927 1,936\nBenefits paid (11,281) (10,743) (1,927) (1,936)\nFair value of plan assets at end of fiscal year 144,091 160,523 - -\nProjected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets $ (4,930) $ (9,982) $ (11,922) $ (14,775)\nAmounts recognized in the statement of financial position consist of:\nAccrued liabilities $ - $ - $ (1,866) $ (1,884)\nOther liabilities (long-term) (4,930) (9,982) (10,056) (12,891)\nTotal Liabilities (4,930) (9,982) (11,922) (14,775)\nNet actuarial losses 32,176 38,296 6,003 7,662\nPrior service cost - - - -\nDeferred taxes (6,757) (8,042) (1,261) (1,609)\nTotal Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax 25,419 30,254 4,742 6,053\nNet amount recognized at September 30, $ 20,489 $ 20,272 $ (7,180) $ (8,722)\nAccumulated benefit obligations $ 149,021 $ 170,505 $ 11,922 $ 14,775\nInformation for plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets:\nABO $ 149,021 $ 170,505 $ 11,922 $ 14,775\nPBO 149,021 170,505 11,922 14,775\nFair value of plan assets 144,091 160,523 - -\nActuarial gains as of September 30, 2022 were primarily the result of the increase in the discount rate.

The Adjusted Funding Target Attainment Percent for the Clopay AMES Pension Plan and Hunter Fan Pension Plan as of January 1, 2022 was 105.0% and 129.2%, respectively. Since the plans were in excess of the 80% funding threshold there were no plan restrictions. There are no catch up contributions for either plan expected in 2023.\nThe actual and weighted-average asset allocation for qualified benefit plans were as follows:\nAt September 30,\n2022 2021 Target\nCash and equivalents 4.3 % 1.2 % - %\nEquity securities 41.1 % 52.5 % 63.0 %\nFixed income 24.6 % 26.9 % 37.0 %\nOther 30.0 % 19.4 % - %\nTotal 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for plan assets measured at fair value:\nGovernment and agency securities - When quoted market prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1. When quoted market prices are not available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 2.\nEquity securities - The fair values reflect the closing price reported on a major market where the individual mutual fund securities are traded in equity securities. These investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\nDebt securities - The fair values are based on a compilation of primarily observable market information or a broker quote in a non-active market where the individual mutual fund securities are invested in debt securities. These investments are classified within Level 1 and Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.\nCommingled funds - The fair values are determined using NAV provided by the administrator of the fund.

All U.S. employees of Griffon, who are not members of a collective bargaining unit, automatically become eligible to participate in the plan on the October 1st following completion of one qualifying year of service (as defined in the plan). Securities are allocated to participants individual accounts based on the proportion of each participants aggregate compensation (not to exceed $295 for the plan year ended September 30, 2022), to the total of all participants compensation. Shares of the ESOP which have been allocated to employee accounts are charged to expense based on the fair value of the shares transferred and are treated as outstanding in determining earnings per share. Dividends paid on shares held by the ESOP are used to offset debt service on ESOP Loans. Dividends paid on shares held in participant accounts are utilized to allocate shares from the aggregate number of shares to be released, equal in value to those dividends, based on the closing price of Griffon common stock on the dividend payment date. Compensation expense under the ESOP was $14,325 in 2022, $3,678 in 2021 and $2,878 in 2020. The cost of the shares held by the ESOP and not yet allocated to employees is reported as a reduction of Shareholders Equity. The fair value of the unallocated ESOP shares as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 based on the closing stock price of Griffons stock was $30,247 and $45,834, respectively.

In 2021, the increase in the valuation allowance of $601 is primarily the result of foreign net operating losses and generation of state tax credits which will not be recognized, partially offset by the expiration of foreign tax credits during the year.\nAt both September 30, 2022 and 2021, Griffon has a policy election to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries with operations outside the U.S. As of September 30, 2022, we have approximately $178,233 of unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company generates substantial cash flow in the U.S. and does not have a current need for the cash to be returned to the U.S. from the foreign entities. The Company continues to reinvest the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes if it reverses its indefinite reinvestment assertion in the future. Outside basis differences were impractical to account for at this time and are currently considered as being permanent in duration.\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nAt September 30, 2022, Griffon had $44,521 loss carryforwards for U.S. tax purposes and $8,798 for non-U.S. tax purposes. At September 30, 2021, Griffon had no loss carryforwards for U.S. tax purposes and $8,332 for non-U.S. tax purposes. The U.S loss carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely but are subject to certain limitations on annual usage. The non-U.S. loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2027 to indefinite carryforward.\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, Griffon had state and local loss carryforwards of $192,134 and $139,894, respectively, which expire in varying amounts through 2041.\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, Griffon had federal tax credit carryforwards of $5,933 and $5,933, respectively, which expire in varying amounts through 2035.\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, Griffon had capital loss carryovers for U.S. tax purposes of $0 and $10,327, respectively, which expire in varying amounts through 2026. The losses were generated in September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2019 tax years. The carryovers are available for three-year carryback or five-year carryforward periods.\nWe believe it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain federal and state tax attributes will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 of $13,490 and $10,425, respectively, on the deferred tax assets. As it becomes probable that the benefits of these attributes will be realized, the reversal of valuation allowance will be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense.\nIf certain substantial changes in Griffon's ownership occur, there would be an annual limitation on the amount of carryforward(s) that can be utilized.\nGriffon files U.S. Federal, state and local tax returns, as well as applicable returns in Canada, Australia, U.K. and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Griffons U.S. Federal income tax returns are no longer subject to income tax examination for years before 2017. Griffon's major U.S. state and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are no longer subject to income tax examinations for years before 2014. Various U.S. state and statutory tax audits are currently underway.\nThe following is a roll forward of unrecognized tax benefits:\nBalance at September 30, 2020 $ 4,180\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year 180\nAdditions based on tax positions related to prior years 24\nLapse of Statutes (7)\nBalance at September 30, 2021 $ 4,377\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year 172\nAdditions based on tax positions related to prior years(1)\n2,298\nLapse of Statutes (39)\nSettlements -\nBalance at September 30, 2022 $ 6,808\n(1) Relates to unrecognized tax benefits assumed with the acquisition of Hunter.\nIf recognized, the amount of potential unrecognized tax benefits that would impact Griffons effective tax rate is $3,536. Griffon recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken or to be taken on Griffons tax returns and recorded as part of the reserves for uncertain tax positions was $521 and $100, respectively. Griffon cannot reasonably estimate the extent to which existing liabilities for uncertain tax positions may increase or decrease within the next twelve months as a result of the progression of ongoing tax audits or other events. Griffon believes that it has adequately provided for all open tax years by tax jurisdiction.\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. Government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (\"IRA\") into law. Included in the IRA was a provision to implement a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income for applicable corporations and a 1% excise tax on repurchases of stock. These provisions are effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. We are in the process of evaluating the provisions of the IRA.\nNOTE 15 - STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND EQUITY COMPENSATION\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company declared and paid, in quarterly increments, cash dividends totaling $0.36 per share, $0.32 per share and $0.30 per share, respectively. In addition, on June 27, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $2.00 per share, paid on July 20, 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2022. The Company currently intends to pay dividends each quarter; however, payment of dividends is determined by the Board of Directors at its discretion based on various factors, and no assurance can be provided as to the payment of future dividends. Dividends paid on shares in the ESOP were used to offset ESOP loan payments and recorded as a reduction of debt service payments and compensation expense. A dividend payable was established for the holders of restricted shares; such dividends will be released upon vesting of the underlying restricted shares. At September, 30, 2022, accrued dividends were $9,514.\nOn November 16, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share, payable on December 16, 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 29, 2022.\nOn August 18, 2020, the Company sold 8,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $21.50 per share through a public equity offering, for a total net proceeds of $163,830, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. In addition, on August 21, 2020, pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of their overallotment option, the underwriters purchased an additional 700,000 shares of common stock from the Company at a price of $21.50, resulting in additional net proceeds to the Company of $14,335. In total, the Company sold 8,700,000 shares of common stock at a price of $21.50 for a total net proceeds of $178,165. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds to temporarily repay outstanding borrowings under its Credit Agreement. The Company used the remainder of the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nOn January 29, 2016, shareholders approved the Griffon Corporation 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"Original Incentive Plan\") pursuant to which, among other things, awards of performance shares, performance units, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units, deferred shares and other stock-based awards may be granted. On January 31, 2018, shareholders approved Amendment No. 1 to the Original Incentive Plan pursuant to which, among other things, 1,000,000 shares were added to the Original Incentive Plan; and on January 30, 2020, shareholders approved Amendment No. 2 to the Original Incentive Plan, pursuant to which 1,700,000 shares were added to the Original Incentive Plan. On February 17, 2022, shareholders approved the Amended and Restated 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the Amended Incentive Plan), which amended and restated the Original Incentive Plan and pursuant to which, among other things, 1,200,000 shares were added to the Original Incentive Plan. Options granted under the Amended Incentive Plan may be either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options, which generally expire ten years after the date of grant and are granted at an exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market value at the date of grant. The maximum number of shares of common stock available for award under the Amended Incentive Plan is 6,250,000 (600,000 of which may be issued as incentive stock options), plus (i) any shares that were reserved for issuance under the Original Incentive Plan as of the effective date of the Original Incentive Plan, and (ii) any shares underlying awards outstanding on such date under the 2011 Incentive Plan that were subsequently canceled or forfeited. As of September 30, 2022, 835,122 shares were available for grant.\nCompensation expense for restricted stock and restricted stock units is recognized ratably over the required service period based on the fair value of the grant, calculated as the number of shares or units granted multiplied by the stock price on date of grant, and for performance shares, including performance units, the likelihood of achieving the performance criteria. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. Compensation expense for restricted stock granted to two senior executives is calculated as the maximum number of shares granted, upon achieving certain performance criteria, multiplied by the stock price as valued by a Monte Carlo Simulation Model. Compensation cost related to stock-based awards with graded vesting, generally over a period of three to four years, is recognized using the straight-line attribution method and recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses.\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non-US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nThe following table summarizes the Companys compensation expense relating to all stock-based compensation plans:\nFor the Years Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nRestricted stock $ 18,810 $ 16,410 $ 14,702\nESOP 14,325 3,678 2,878\nTotal stock based compensation $ 33,135 $ 20,088 $ 17,580\nA summary of restricted stock activity, inclusive of restricted stock units, for 2022 is as follows:\nShares Weighted Average\nGrant- Date Fair Value\nUnvested at September 30, 2021 3,866,053 $ 15.32\nGranted 1,004,755 21.35\nVested (1,015,740) 25.46\nForfeited (151,501) 17.63\nUnvested at September 30, 2022 3,703,567 24.70\nThe fair value of restricted stock which vested during 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $25,863, $10,627 and $17,889, respectively.\nUnrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested shares of restricted stock was $30,301 at September 30, 2022 and will be recognized over a weighted average vesting period of 2.0 years.\nAt September 30, 2022, a total of approximately 4,538,689 shares of Griffons authorized Common Stock were reserved for issuance in connection with stock compensation plans.\nDuring 2022, Griffon granted 946,371 shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units to its employees. This included 218,162 restricted stock and restricted stock units, subject to certain performance conditions, with vesting periods of 34 months with a total fair value of $6,285, or a weighted average fair value of $28.81 per share. Furthermore, this included 274,063 restricted stock awards granted to seventeen executives, with a vesting period of three years and a total fair value of $6,240, or a weighted average fair value of $22.77 per share. This also included 454,146 shares of restricted stock granted to two senior executives with a vesting period of thirty-four months and a two-year post-vesting holding period, subject to the achievement of certain performance conditions relating to required levels of return on invested capital and the relative total shareholder return of Griffon's common stock as compared to a market index.

In addition, Griffon also granted 205,296 shares of restricted stock granted to two senior executives with a vesting period of thirty-six months and a two-year post-vesting holding period, subject to the achievement of certain performance conditions relating to required levels of return on invested capital and the relative total shareholder return of Griffon's common stock as compared to a market index. So long as the minimum performance conditions are attained, the amount of shares that can vest will range from a minimum of 51,324 to a maximum of 205,296, with the target number of shares being 102,648. The total estimated fair value of these restricted shares, assuming achievement of the performance conditions at target, is $3,555, or a weighted average fair value of $34.63 per share.\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non-US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nOn each of August 3, 2016 and August 1, 2018, Griffons Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50,000 of Griffons outstanding common stock. Under these share repurchase programs, the Company may purchase shares of its common stock, depending upon market conditions, in open market or privately negotiated transactions, including pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan. Shares repurchased are recorded at cost. During 2020, Griffon did not purchase shares of common stock under these repurchase programs. At September 30, 2022 an aggregate of $57,955 remains under Griffon's Board authorized repurchase authorizations.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, 421,860 shares, with a market value of $10,742, or $25.46 per share, were withheld to settle employee taxes due upon the vesting of restricted stock, and were added to treasury stock. Furthermore, during 2022, an additional 5,480 shares, with a market value of $144, or $26.31 per share, were withheld from common stock issued upon the vesting of restricted stock units to settle employee taxes due upon vesting.\nNOTE 16 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nPurchase Commitments\nPurchase obligations are generally for the purchase of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Griffon uses blanket purchase orders to communicate expected requirements to certain vendors. Purchase obligations reflect those purchase orders where the commitment is considered to be firm. Amounts purchased under such commitments were $255,661, $235,148 and $142,712 for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Aggregate future minimum purchase obligations at September 30, 2022 are $184,422 in 2022, $16,463 in 2023, $3,622 in 2024, $0 in 2025 and $0 in 2026.\nLegal and environmental\nPeekskill Site. Lightron Corporation (Lightron), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Griffon, once conducted lamp manufacturing and metal finishing operations at a location in the Town of Cortlandt, New York, just outside the city of Peekskill, New York (the Peekskill Site) which was owned by ISC Properties, Inc. (ISCP), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Griffon, for approximately three years. ISCP sold the Peekskill Site in November 1982.\nBased upon studies conducted by ISCP and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, soils and groundwater beneath the Peekskill Site contain chlorinated solvents and metals. Stream sediments downgradient of the Peekskill Site also contain metals. On May 15, 2019 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") added the Peekskill Site to the National Priorities List under CERCLA and has since reached agreement with Lightron and ISCP wherein Lightron and ISCP will perform a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS).\nLightron has not engaged in any operations in over three decades. ISCP functioned solely as a real estate holding company and has not held any real property in over three decades. Griffon does not acknowledge any responsibility to perform any investigation or remediation at the Peekskill Site. One of Griffons insurers is defending Lightron, ISCP and Griffon subject to a reservation of rights and is paying the costs of the RI/FS.\nUnion Fork and Hoe, Frankfort, NY site. The former Union Fork and Hoe property in Frankfort, NY was acquired by AMES in 2006 as part of a larger acquisition, and has historic site contamination involving chlorinated solvents, petroleum hydrocarbons and metals. AMES entered into an Order on Consent with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). While the Order is without admission or finding of liability or acknowledgment that there has been a release of hazardous substances at the site, the Order required AMES to perform a remedial investigation of certain portions of the property and to recommend a remediation option. In 2011, remediation of chlorinated solvents in the groundwater was completed to the satisfaction of DEC. In June 2020, AMES completed the remediation required by the Record of Decision issued by DEC in 2019 and filed a Construction Completion Report, a Site Management Plan and an environmental easement with DEC. DEC has approved the Site Management Plan, which requires annual inspection of the site cover and groundwater monitoring every five years. AMES also has completed an investigation of certain areas adjacent to the site perimeter and a statistical analysis to determine the area, if any, required to be remediated. DEC has informed AMES that no further investigation or remediation is required. AMES has a number of defenses to liability in this matter, including its rights under a\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nprevious Consent Judgment entered into between DEC and a predecessor of AMES relating to the site. AMES insurer has accepted AMES claim for a substantial portion of the costs incurred and to be incurred for both the on-site and off-site activities.\nMemphis, TN site. Hunter Fan Company (Hunter) operated headquarters and a production plant in Memphis, TN for over 50 years (the Memphis Site). While Hunter completed certain on-site remediation of PCB-contaminated soils, Hunter did not investigate the extent to which PCBs existed beneath the building itself nor determine whether off-site areas had been impacted. Hunter vacated the site approximately twenty years ago, and the on-site buildings have now been demolished.\nThe State of Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) identified the Memphis site as being potentially contaminated, raising the possibility that site operations could have resulted in soil and groundwater contamination involving volatile organic compounds and metals. The TDEC performed a preliminary assessment of the site and recommended to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that the site be listed on the National Priorities List established under CERCLA. The TDEC further recommended that the EPA fund an investigation of potential soil gas contamination in receptors near the site. The TDEC has also indicated that it will proceed with this investigation if the EPA does not act.\nIt is unknown whether the EPA will add the Memphis Site to the National Priorities List, whether a site investigation will reveal contamination and, if there is contamination, the extent of such contamination. However, given that certain PCB work was not completed in the past and the TDECs stated intent for the EPA to perform an investigation (and the statement by the TDEC that it will perform the investigation if the EPA will not), liability is probable in this matter. There are other potentially responsible parties for this site, including a former owner of Hunter; Hunter has notified such former owner of this matter, which may have certain liability for any required remediation.\nIf the EPA decides to add this site to the National Priorities List, a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) will be required. Hunter expects that EPA will ask it to perform this work. If Hunter does not reach an agreement with the EPA to perform this work, the EPA will implement the RI/FS on its own. Should the EPA implement the RI/FS or perform further studies and/or subsequently remediate the site without first reaching an agreement with one or more relevant parties, the EPA would likely seek from such parties, including Hunter, reimbursement for the costs incurred.\nGeneral legal\nGriffon is subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and is a party to legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Management believes, based on facts presently known to it, that the resolution of the matters above and such other matters will not have a material adverse effect on Griffons consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non-US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nNOTE 17 - EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic EPS (and diluted EPS in periods when a loss exists) was calculated by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.

This new guidance requires a lessee to recognize right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet, with an election to exempt leases with a term of twelve months or less. The Company adopted the requirements of the new standard as of October 1, 2019 and applied the modified retrospective approach, whereby the cumulative effect of adoption is recognized as of the date of adoption and comparative prior periods are not retrospectively adjusted. As a result, upon adoption, we recognized ROU assets of $163,552 and lease liabilities of $163,676 associated with our operating leases. The standard had no material impact to retained earnings or on our Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company has elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allows us to carry forward the historical lease classification. We also elected a practical expedient to determine the reasonably certain lease term.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The ROU assets and short and long-term liabilities associated with our operating leases are shown as separate line items on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant, and equipment, net, other accrued liabilities, and other non-current liabilities. ROU assets, along with any other related long-lived assets, are periodically evaluated for impairment. In connection with the Company's restructuring activities, during the year ended September 30, 2020, a $1,968 impairment charge was recorded related to a facilitys operating lease as well as $671 and of leasehold improvements made to the leased facility that have no recoverable value. See Note 10, Restructuring Charges.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. For leases existing as of October 1, 2019, we have elected to use the remaining lease term as of the adoption date in determining the incremental borrowing rate. Our determination of the lease term may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\nGRIFFON CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(US dollars and non-US currencies in thousands, except per share data)\nFor operating leases, fixed lease payments are recognized as operating lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases and impaired operating leases, the ROU asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term, along with recognition of interest expense associated with accretion of the lease liability. For leases with a lease term of 12 months or less (a \"Short-term\" lease), any fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over such term, and are not recognized on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Variable lease cost for both operating and finance leases, if any, is recognized as incurred. The Company has lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, we account for lease components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance).

The lease matures in 2025 and bears interest at a fixed rate of approximately 5.6%. The Ocala, Florida lease contains two five-year renewal options. At September 30, 2022, $13,091 was outstanding. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the financing lease on the Troy, Ohio location expired. The lease bore interest at a rate of approximately 5.0%, was secured by a mortgage on the real estate, which was guaranteed by Griffon, and had a one dollar buyout at the end of the lease.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation and Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nGriffons management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Griffons disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, Griffons disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Griffon in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SECs rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nSEC guidance permits the exclusion of an evaluation of the effectiveness of a registrant's disclosure controls and procedures as they relate to the internal control over financial reporting for an acquired business during the first year following such acquisition. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report, the Company acquired Hunter Fan Company (\"Hunter\"). The acquisition represents approximately 9.0% of the Company's consolidated revenue for the year ended September 30, 2022, and approximately 31.0% of the Company's consolidated assets at September 30, 2022. Management's evaluation and conclusion as to the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022 excludes any evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Hunter.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nGriffons management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Griffons internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Griffons financial statements for external reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management evaluates the effectiveness of Griffons internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Management, under the supervision and with the participation of Griffons Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of Griffons internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022 and concluded that it is effective.\nGriffons independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP, has audited the effectiveness of Griffons internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, and has expressed an unqualified opinion in their report which appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nThere were no changes in Griffons internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation referred to above that occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrants internal control over financial reporting.\nIn connection with the Hunter acquisition, Griffon is in the process of integrating its controls and procedures with respect to\nHunter's operations. Griffon expects to include the internal controls with respect to Hunter operations in its assessment of the\neffectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of fiscal year 2023. Other than the acquisition of\nHunter, during the period covered by this report, there were no changes in Griffons internal control over financial reporting\nwhich materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Griffons internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nGriffons internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Griffons internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Griffons assets;\n(ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that Griffons receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Griffons management and directors; and\n(iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Griffons assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including Griffons Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that Griffons internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods is subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
