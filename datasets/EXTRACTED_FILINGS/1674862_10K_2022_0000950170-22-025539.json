Ashlands Environmental, Health, Safety, Quality and Regulatory Affairs (EHSQ&RA) department has the responsibility to ensure that Ashlands businesses worldwide maintain environmental compliance in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This responsibility is carried out via training; widespread communication of EHSQ&RA policies; information and regulatory updates; formulation of relevant policies, procedures and work practices; design and implementation of EHSQ&RA management systems; internal auditing; monitoring of legislative and regulatory developments that may affect Ashlands operations; assistance to the businesses in identifying compliance issues and opportunities for voluntary actions that go beyond compliance; and incident response planning and implementation.\nFederal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment have a significant impact on how Ashland conducts its businesses. In addition, Ashlands operations outside the United States are subject to the environmental laws of the countries in which they are located. These laws include regulation of air emissions and water discharges, waste handling, remediation and product inventory, registration and regulation. New laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted by various regulatory agencies globally. The costs of compliance with any new laws or regulations cannot be estimated until the manner in which they will be implemented has been more precisely defined.\nAt September 30, 2022, Ashlands reserves for environmental remediation and related environmental litigation amounted to $211 million, reflecting Ashlands estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable, without regard to any third-party recoveries. Engineering studies, historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation. Environmental remediation reserves are subject to uncertainties that affect Ashlands ability to estimate its share of the costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site and the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of environmental remediation, Ashland currently estimates that the upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for identified sites could be as high as approximately $465 million. No individual remediation location is significant, as the largest reserve for any site is 13% of the remediation reserve. Ashland regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues. Environmental remediation expense, net of insurance receivables, amounted to $66 million in 2022 compared to $51 million in 2021 and $48 million in 2020.\nProduct Control, Registration and Inventory - Many of Ashlands products and operations are subject to chemical control laws of the countries in which they are located. These laws include regulation of chemical substances and inventories under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) in the United States and the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) regulation in Europe. Under REACH, additional testing requirements, documentation, risk assessments and registrations are occurring and will continue to occur and may adversely affect Ashlands costs of products produced in or imported into the European Union. Examples of other product control regulations include right to know laws under the Global Harmonized System (GHS) for hazard communication, regulation of chemicals used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and personal care products and that contact food under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act in the United States, the Framework Regulation in Europe and other product control requirements for chemical weapons, drug precursors and import/export. New laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted by various regulatory agencies globally. The costs of compliance with any new laws or regulations cannot be estimated until the manner in which they will be implemented has been more precisely defined.\nRemediation - Ashland currently operates, and in the past has operated, various facilities at which, during the normal course of business, releases of hazardous substances have occurred. Additionally, Ashland has known or alleged potential environmental liabilities at a number of third-party sites. Federal and state laws, including but not limited to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and various other remediation laws, require that contamination caused by hazardous substance releases be assessed and, if necessary, remediated to meet applicable standards. Some of these laws also provide for liability for related damage to natural resources, and claims for alleged property and personal injury damage which can also arise related to contaminated sites. Laws in other jurisdictions in which Ashland operates require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and, if necessary, remediated to meet applicable standards.\nAir - In the United States, the Clean Air Act (CAA) imposes stringent limits on facility air emissions, establishes a federally mandated operating permit program, allows for civil and criminal enforcement actions and sets limits on the volatile or toxic content of many types of industrial materials and consumer products. The CAA establishes national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) with attainment deadlines and control requirements based on the severity of air pollution in a given geographical area. Various state clean air acts implement, complement and, in many instances, add to the requirements of the federal CAA. The requirements of the CAA and its state counterparts have a significant impact on the daily operation of Ashlands businesses and, in many cases, on product formulation and other long-term business decisions. Other countries where Ashland operates also have laws and regulations relating to air quality. Ashlands businesses maintain numerous permits and emission control devices pursuant to these clean air laws.\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has increased its frequency in reviewing the NAAQS. The USEPA has stringent standards for particulate matter, ozone and sulfur dioxide. Throughout 2022, state and local agencies continued to implement options for meeting the newest standards. Particulate matter strategies include dust control measures for construction sites and reductions in emission rates allowed for industrial operations. Options for ozone include emission controls for certain types of sources, reduced limits on the volatile organic compound content of industrial materials and consumer products, and requirements on the transportation sector. Most options for sulfur dioxide focus on coal and diesel fuel combustion sources. It is not possible at this time to estimate the potential financial impact that these newest standards may have on Ashlands operations or products. Ashland will continue to monitor and evaluate these standards to meet these and all air quality requirements.\nSolid Waste - Ashlands businesses are subject to various laws relating to and establishing standards for the management of hazardous and solid waste. In the United States, Ashlands facilities are subject to RCRA and its regulations governing generators of hazardous waste. Ashland has implemented systems to oversee compliance with the RCRA regulations. In addition to regulating current waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the storage of regulated substances in underground tanks. Ashland has the remediation liability for certain facilities subject to these regulations. Other countries where Ashland operates also have laws and regulations relating to hazardous and solid waste, and Ashland has systems in place to oversee compliance.\nWater - Ashlands businesses maintain numerous discharge permits. In the United States, such permits may be required by the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System of the Clean Water Act and similar state programs. Other countries have similar laws and regulations requiring permits and controls relating to water discharge.\nClimate Change and Related Regulatory Developments - Ashland has been collecting energy use data and calculating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for many years. Ashland evaluates the potential impacts from both climate change and the anticipated GHG regulations to facilities, products and other business interests, as well as the strategies commonly considered by the industrial sector to reduce the potential impact of these risks. These risks are generally grouped as impacts from legislative, regulatory and international developments, impacts from business and investment trends and impacts to Company assets from the physical effects of climate change. North American, European and other regional regulatory developments are monitored continuously for material impacts to Ashlands operations, and some facilities are subject to promulgated rules. Proposed and pending climate legislation is monitored for impact and Ashland is taking steps to strengthen climate reporting to meet anticipated disclosure requirements. Business and investment trends are expected to drive an increase in the demand for products that improve energy efficiency, reduce energy use and increase the use of renewable resources. At this time, Ashland cannot estimate the impact of this expected demand increase to its businesses. Physical effects from climate change have the potential to affect Ashlands assets in areas prone to sea level rise or extreme weather events much as they do the general public and other businesses. Due to the uncertainty of these matters, Ashland cannot estimate the impact at this time of GHG-related developments on its operations or financial condition.\nCompetition\nAshland competes in the highly fragmented additives and specialty ingredients industries. The participants in these industries offer a varied and broad array of product lines designed to meet specific customer requirements. Participants compete with service and product offerings on a global, regional and/or local level subject to the nature of the businesses and products, as well as the end-markets and customers served. Competition is based on several key criteria, including product performance and quality, product price, product availability and security of supply, responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers, customer service, industry knowledge and technical capability. Certain key competitors are significantly larger than Ashland and have greater financial resources, leading to greater operating and financial flexibility. The industry has become increasingly global as participants have focused on establishing and maintaining leadership positions outside of their home markets. Many of these segments product lines face domestic and international competition, due to industry consolidation, pricing pressures and competing technologies. To improve its competitive position, as Ashland narrows its focus, the Company is building and leveraging the Ashland corporate brand as a differentiator to create value and better communicate the capabilities, promise and scale of the Company, making it easier to introduce new product lines and applications.\nIntellectual Property\nAshland has a broad intellectual property portfolio which is an important component of its business. Ashland relies on patents, trade secrets, formulae and know-how to protect and differentiate its products and technologies. In addition, the reportable segments own valuable trademarks which identify and differentiate its products from its competitors. Ashland also uses licensed intellectual property rights from third-parties.\nRaw Materials\nAshland purchases its raw materials from multiple sources of supply in the United States and other countries and believes that raw material supplies will be available in quantities sufficient to meet demand in fiscal 2023. All of Ashlands reportable segments were impacted, to varying degrees, by the volatility of raw materials costs in fiscal 2022, and these conditions may continue in fiscal 2023, especially those of hydrocarbon derivatives, cotton linters or wood pulp origin. Similarly, energy costs are a significant component of production costs.\nResearch and Development\nAshlands program of research and development is focused on defining the needs of the marketplace and framing those needs into technology platforms. Ashland has the capability to develop and deliver the intellectual property required to grow and protect those platforms. Ashland is focused on developing new chemistries, market-changing technologies and customer driven solutions at numerous technology centers located in the Americas, Europe and the Asia Pacific regions.\nSeasonality\nAshlands business may vary due to seasonality. Ashlands business units typically experience stronger demand during warmer weather months.\nHuman Capital\nEmployee Health and Safety - Cultivating a safety culture is intentional at Ashland and is best shown by its commitment to a Zero Incident Culture (ZIC). ZIC begins with the vision, values, beliefs, and actions of Ashlands leaders demonstrating that zero incidents is possible. It means developing processes where compliance is the minimum expectation, allowing employees to proactively manage safety above compliance on the journey to zero.\nAs an indication of its commitment to Responsible Care, Ashland obtained a third-party certification to RC14001, which includes the internationally recognized ISO 14001 certification and adds additional health, safety, security, and chemical industry requirements. Currently, Ashland has 24 international sites participating on a group RC14001 certification. Also, as part of its commitment to health and safety, 16 of the Company's sites have obtained an additional ISO 45001 certification, an international health and safety management system.\nAs part of ZIC, the Company strives every day to achieve zero incidents. Ashland continues to make good progress on its journey. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company had a Total Preventable Recordable Rate (TPRR) of 0.58 compared to 0.73 for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nAshland has implemented several tools for communicating lessons learned from injuries, process safety incidents, and environmental releases. Immediately following an event, flash reports are developed and shared to communicate key lessons learned across the Company with a review call within 48 hours with EHS and Operations Leadership. Additionally, incidents and root causes/corrective and preventive actions are reviewed monthly with Company leadership and EHS leaders globally to discuss areas for improvement and highlight the importance of identifying and addressing management system errors.\nAshland has implemented the Good Catch Program aimed at identifying underlying unsafe conditions or behaviors that could lead to an undesirable outcome. Employees are encouraged to report good catches that fall into one of three categories - substandard conditions, near misses, and suggestions. These are tracked with the goal of continuing to increase overall reporting of identified good catches year to year.\nEnvironmental - Ashland has a conscious and proactive mindset for sustainability and has established a renewable annual trust for ongoing and future environmental remediation and related litigation cash outlays. The initiative follows Ashland's announcement in February 2021 to align its operations with the ambitious aim of the Paris Climate Accord to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C above preindustrial levels. At that time, Ashland also became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact and is making the United Nations principles part of the Company's business strategy, culture, and day-to-day operations. Ashland has targets to reduce its environmental footprint (including energy usage, GHG emissions, and hazardous waste generation). These targets and progress towards meeting them can be found on: https://www.ashland.com/esg/esg-overview, which is not incorporated by reference into the Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCOVID-19 - The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the world in unprecedented ways, affecting millions of people and countless institutions around the world. Ashlands Incident Management Teams (IMT) have operated with the focus of keeping its employees, customers, and families safe while continuing to provide essential additives and specialty ingredients during this crisis.\nSince the beginning of its ZIC journey over 20 years ago, Ashland has focused on preparedness and prevention and established an IMT which executed pandemic response plans. The COVID-19 IMT was formed in early January 2020 to support its China and Asia-Pacific operations and scaled to five regional teams under the direction of the Global IMT and Executive Leadership Team. Ashland continued the IMT for COVID-19 through the end of September 2022 and will continue the Science Intelligence Unit (SIU) meetings to review the current situations.\nAshlands safety, health, purchasing, information technology, supply chain, and human resource teams have worked with the Companys facilities to rapidly implement workplace changes, obtain personal protective equipment, and provide sanitization supplies to its employees while developing a reserve of materials to ensure continued safe operations.\nAshlands first priority is always the health and well-being of its employees, customers, and communities. Since the start of the pandemic, the Companys focus has shifted from managing an immediate crisis to building in the flexibility needed to adjust for regional differences and changing conditions. Employees have been able to return to their work sites globally.\nHuman Capital Management - Ashlands global workforce is its greatest asset. Ashland is committed to continuously evaluating and strengthening the growth-minded and innovative culture by attracting and developing exceptional global talent, supporting employees physical, emotional, and financial well-being, and recognizing and rewarding performance. To achieve the highest return, Ashland is building an inclusive and high-integrity organization where everyone belongs, feels inspired to excel, and does the right thing.\nAs of September 30, 2022, Ashland had approximately 3,900 employees who thrive on developing practical, innovative, and simple solutions to complex problems for customers in more than 100 countries. The employees global demographics consist of approximately 69% male employees and approximately 31% female employees, and in the U.S., approximately 26% of its employees self-identify as ethnically diverse.\nAshland's global footprint is geographically located as follows:\nCompetitive Pay and Benefits - Ashland is committed to paying its employees in a fair and equitable manner, regardless of race or gender, and has implemented global total rewards tools to promote equitable remuneration. The Company provides a total compensation package that is designed to be competitive with the markets in which it competes for talent. Ashland believes employees should be compensated equitably based on performance, skills, and experience.\nAshland reviews pay equity annually in conjunction with its annual performance review, merit, and promotion processes. In 2022, the Company completed an in-depth analysis of its pay equity globally using a number of factors to determine if a pay gap existed based on any protected factors (gender, age, race, veteran status). Overall findings were encouraging, identifying only a few employees that had a disparity in pay requiring further analysis and corrective action. Ashland reviews the process annually to ensure that its policies, procedures, and training continue to provide pay equity within the Company.\nThe Companys compensation programs are globally aligned, and, where possible, its total rewards plans include base salary, short and long-term incentives, benefits, financial, and special recognition programs. The Company routinely reviews its total rewards practices in the markets in which it operates to ensure its plans allow for the recruitment and retention of the talent it needs to be successful.\nAshland also offers a competitive global benefits program to support employees through all life stages. The following benefit plans are available to employees depending on local markets in which the Company operates that include plan specific features such as on-site and on-demand resources:\nHealth care benefits including medical, prescription, dental and/or vision\nWellness initiatives:\noGlobal EAP (employee assistance program)\noFlu vaccination resources\nPaid time off\nVoluntary benefits\nLife and accident coverage\nDisability coverage\nRetirement plans\nTuition reimbursement\nBusiness travel accident\nInclusion and Diversity - The company believes one powerful and necessary way to live that purpose is to proactively strengthen both the diversity of the workforce and the inclusiveness of the culture. In 2022, Ashland established a global inclusion and diversity strategy focused on belonging, accountability, community engagement, recruitment, and internal mobility. These priorities serve as the basis of the global and local objectives and initiatives that advance Ashland's collective progress towards equity. The company and its leadership team are committed to creating a collaborative environment that leverages the talents of a diverse global workforce to drive sustainable growth and innovation that creates value for its shareholders, customers, employees, and the communities in which it operate.\nAshlands commitment to inclusion and diversity starts at the top with its Board and executive leadership.

The demographics of the EC include 33% women and 45% who identify as ethnically diverse individuals. Further information related\nto its EC is included under the caption Information About the Companys Executive Officers under Item X within Part I of this Form 10-K.\nTalent Management - Ashland is dedicated to creating a purpose-driven people ecosystem that enables personal and professional growth at every level while minimizing risk to the business. The Company deploys a disciplined annual talent review and succession process to identify and develop a leadership pipeline that accelerates business results and minimizes attrition. The talent management process includes a performance management process that seeks to provide employees on-going feedback to enhance their performance in support of business objectives. As part of Ashland's commitment to professional development, it offers associates and bachelors undergraduate, graduate, and PhD tuition assistance to eligible employees.\nIn 2022, the Company elevated the skillset of its leaders as it moved to a hybrid work environment and established a foundation for inclusivity and allyship in practice. Ashland launched a global Culture Survey, with an 83% response rate, that provided us with valuable insight to prioritize investments in the tools, resources, and processes that will make a positive impact on employees well-being, engagement, and career growth. Ashland remains committed to continuously listening and evolving its people practices to align with and drive the Companys purpose and business success.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). These forward-looking statements are not historical facts and generally are identified by words such as anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, is likely, predicts, projects, forecasts, objectives, may, will, should, plans, and intends and the negative of these words or other comparable terminology. Although Ashland believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, such expectations are subject to risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and may be beyond Ashlands control. As a result, Ashland cannot assure that the expectations contained in such statements will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in such statements are discussed under Use of estimates, risks and uncertainties in Note A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10-K. For a discussion of other factors and risks that could affect Ashlands expectations and operations, see ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect Ashlands business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K. The following discussion of risks is designed to highlight what Ashland believes are important factors to\nconsider when evaluating its expectations. These factors could cause future results to differ from those in forward-looking statements and from historical trends.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on Ashlands business operations, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nAshland continues to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of its business and geographies, including how the pandemic will impact customers, employees, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels. The COVID-19 pandemic has and may create significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, which may materially and adversely affect Ashlands business operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial position. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact Ashland will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that are difficult to predict, including: the severity of the virus and any related variants; the duration of the outbreak; governmental, business and other actions in response to the pandemic (which could include limitations on Ashlands operations or mandates to provide products or services); the impact of the pandemic on Ashlands supply chain; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity; the extent and duration of the effect on consumer confidence and spending, customer demand and buying patterns including spending on discretionary categories; the health of and the effect on Ashlands workforce and its ability to meet staffing needs through the operations and other critical functions, particularly if employees are quarantined as a result of exposure; any impairment in value of tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of weaker economic conditions; the impact on Ashlands business and the global economy from governmental actions related to international trade; and the potential effects on internal controls including those over financial reporting as a result of changes in working environments such as shelter-in-place and similar orders that are applicable to employees and business partners, among others. In addition, if the pandemic continues to create disruptions or volatility in the credit or financial markets, or impacts Ashlands credit ratings, it could adversely affect Ashlands ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet its liquidity needs, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition, Ashland cannot predict the continued impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on its customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and each of their financial conditions; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact Ashland. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A any of which could have a material effect on Ashland. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that Ashland is not aware of currently.\nBusiness Operations, Financial Performance and Growth\nAshland has set aggressive growth goals for its businesses, including increasing sales, cash flow and margins, in order to achieve its long term strategic objectives. Ashlands successful execution of its growth strategies and business plans to facilitate that growth involves a number of risks.\nAshland has set aggressive growth goals for its businesses in order to meet long term strategic objectives and improve shareholder value. Ashlands failure to meet one or more of these goals or objectives would negatively impact Ashlands potential value and its businesses. One of the most important risks is that Ashland might fail to adequately execute its business and growth plans, by optimizing the efficient use of its physical and intangible assets. Aspects of that risk include changes to global economic environment, changes to the competitive landscape, attraction and retention of skilled employees, the potential failure of product innovation plans, failure to comply with existing or new regulatory schemes, failure to maintain a competitive cost structure and other risks outlined in greater detail in this Item 1A.\nBusiness disruptions from natural, operational and other catastrophic risks could seriously harm Ashlands operations and financial performance. In addition, a catastrophic event at one of Ashlands facilities or involving its products or employees could lead to liabilities that could further impair its operations and financial performance.\nBusiness disruptions, including those related to operating hazards inherent with the production of chemicals, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, supply or logistics disruptions, increasing costs for energy, temporary plant and/or power outages, information technology systems and network disruptions, cyber-security breach, terrorist attacks, armed conflict, war, pandemic diseases, fires, floods or other catastrophic events, could seriously harm Ashlands operations, as well as the operations of its customers and suppliers, and may adversely impact Ashlands financial performance. Although it is impossible to predict the\noccurrence or consequences of any such events, they could result in reduced demand for Ashlands products, make it difficult or impossible for Ashland to manufacture its products or deliver products to its customers or to receive raw materials from suppliers, or create delays and inefficiencies in the supply chain. In addition to leading to a serious disruption of Ashlands businesses, a catastrophic event at one of our facilities or involving our products or employees could lead to substantial legal liability to or claims by parties allegedly harmed by the event.\nWhile Ashland maintains business continuity plans that are intended to allow it to continue operations or mitigate the effects of events that could disrupt its business, Ashland cannot provide assurances that its plans would fully protect it from all such events. In addition, insurance maintained by Ashland to protect against property damage, loss of business and other related consequences resulting from catastrophic events is subject to various deductibles and coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of Ashlands damages or damages to others in the event of a catastrophe. In addition, insurance related to these types of risks may not be available now or, if available, may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable rates.\nClimate change impacts including supply chain disruptions, operational impacts, and geopolitical events may impact Ashland's business operations.\nAshland sources a large number of raw materials from third party suppliers globally. These products include both natural and synthetic materials derived from plants, animal products, organic and petroleum based raw materials. Disruptions to the global supply chain due to climate related impacts or geopolitical events are possible and exist as external risk factors that the Company can respond to but not control. These events could limit the supply of key raw materials to the Company, or could have significant impacts to pricing. Ashland works with multiple raw material suppliers to mitigate lack of availability from a single supplier, however in some cases products with limited numbers of suppliers may become difficult to obtain.\nAshland has manufacturing operations in areas vulnerable to coastal storms which may increase in magnitude and impact due to climate change. Ashland continues to implement response and resilience measures such as storm hardening and business continuity planning, however increasingly large and unprecedented weather events may pose a risk to business operations in vulnerable areas. Storms could cause business interruptions, incur additional restoration costs, and impact product availability and pricing.\nConsumer preference is increasingly impacted by awareness of and a response to climate change. Consumers are increasingly demanding responsibly sourced and manufactured products. An inability to respond to consumer demands through environmental, social and governance (ESG) innovation could lead to a loss of sales to competitors providing more sustainable product offerings.\nEnergy availability and pricing has been impacted by geopolitical events and may be impacted by climate related legislation and regulations. As climate legislation increases in many countries, the availability of conventional and nonrenewable energy may be increasingly limited and prices may continue to increase. Where demand exceeds energy capacity, energy disruptions such as brown out or black out events are possible, leading to business interruption and quality/operational impacts. Failure to respond to or mitigate this risk could lead to increased cost and business impacts.\nAshlands customers could change their products in a way that reduces the demand for Ashlands products.\nAshland produces and sells specialty materials that are used by its customers for a broad range of applications. Many of these Ashland materials become part of end products that are sold to consumers. Changes in consumer preferences and demands can lead to certain Ashland customers making changes to their products. In other instances, Ashlands customers may change their products or production techniques to take advantage of newer technologies, alternative chemistries, more effective formulations, or improved processes, or in response to various market, technical or regulatory changes.\nSuch changes in Ashlands customers products or production techniques may cause these customers to reduce consumption of Ashlands products or eliminate their need entirely. Ashland may not be able to supply products that meet the customers new requirements. Such lost sales opportunities may not be replaced by those offering equal revenue potential or margin. It is important for Ashland to continue developing new products, and new applications of existing products to replace such lost business. Otherwise, Ashland faces the risk of a loss of market share, margins and cash flow if it is unable to manage a potential change in the demands of its products.\nAshlands substantial global operations subject it to risks of doing business in foreign countries, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGreater than half of Ashlands net sales for fiscal 2022 were to customers outside of North America. Ashland expects sales from international markets to continue to represent an even larger portion of the Companys sales in the future. Also, a significant portion of Ashlands manufacturing capacity is located outside of the United States. Accordingly, Ashlands business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, cultural, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions.\nThe global nature of Ashlands business presents difficulties in hiring and maintaining a workforce in certain countries. Fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided in foreign countries. In addition, foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax Ashlands foreign income, or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls. The imposition of new tariffs or trade quotas, or an impairment of existing trade agreements is also a risk that could impair Ashlands financial performance.\nCertain legal and political risks are also inherent in the operation of a company with Ashlands global scope. For example, in November 2018, the United States reached an agreement with Canada and Mexico on the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA), which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) effective July 1, 2020. Among other things, USMCA includes revised country of origin rules and various labor provisions. In addition, the United Kingdoms exit from the European Union (E.U.) could disrupt European supply chains or customs regimes. Ashlands ability to do business and execute its growth strategies could be adversely affected by either of these changes or other changes to trade policy and trade relationships. Ashland could also be impacted negatively if the ongoing trade disputes between the United States and China, or those between the United States and the E.U. were to worsen. In addition, it may be more difficult for Ashland to enforce its agreements or collect receivables through foreign legal systems. There is a risk that foreign governments may nationalize private enterprises in certain countries where Ashland operates. In certain countries or regions, terrorist activities and the response to such activities may threaten Ashlands operations more than those in the United States. In Europe, the effect of economic sanctions imposed on Russia and/or Russias reaction to the sanctions could adversely impact Ashlands performance and results of operations. The risks associated with localized or regional armed conflict in many parts of the world remain high and could disrupt and/or adversely impact Ashlands businesses. Social and cultural norms in certain countries may not support compliance with Ashlands corporate policies including those that require compliance with substantive laws and regulations. Also, changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where Ashland operates, particularly in Europe, the Middle East and emerging markets, are a risk to Ashlands financial performance.\nAs Ashland continues to operate its business globally, its success will depend, in part, on its ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to its multinational operations will not have an adverse effect on Ashlands business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdverse developments in the global economy and potential disruptions of financial markets could negatively impact Ashlands customers and suppliers, and therefore have a negative impact on Ashlands results of operations.\nA global or regional economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit Ashlands ability to produce and sell products. Ashlands business and operating results are sensitive to global and regional economic downturns, credit market tightness, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates, changes in interest rates, sovereign debt defaults and other challenges, including those related to international sanctions and acts of aggression or\nthreatened aggression that can affect the global economy. In the event of adverse developments or stagnation in the economy or financial markets, Ashlands customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, reduced demand for their products, cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing. As a result, existing or potential customers might delay or cancel plans to purchase products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to Ashland in a timely fashion. Further, suppliers may experience similar conditions, which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to Ashland. A weakening or reversal of the current economic conditions in the global economy or a substantial part of it could negatively impact Ashlands business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to grow.\nAshlands substantial indebtedness may adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAshland maintains a substantial amount of debt. Ashlands substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things:\nrequiring Ashland to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on its debt, which would reduce the availability of Ashlands cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, execution of its growth strategy and other general corporate purposes;\nlimiting Ashlands ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of its growth strategy and other purposes;\nmaking Ashland more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and regulatory conditions and in its business by limiting Ashlands flexibility in planning for, and making it more difficult for Ashland to react quickly to, changing conditions;\nplacing Ashland at a competitive disadvantage compared with those of its competitors that have less debt and lower debt service requirements;\nmaking Ashland more vulnerable to increases in interest rates if debt is refinanced; and\nmaking it more difficult for Ashland to satisfy its financial obligations.\nIn addition, Ashland may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations to repay its indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet its other cash needs. If Ashland is not able to pay its debts as they become due, it could be in default under its credit facility or other indebtedness. Ashland might also be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies to repay indebtedness, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring its indebtedness or selling additional debt or equity securities. Ashland may not be able to refinance its debt or sell additional debt or equity securities or its assets on favorable terms, if at all, and if Ashland must sell its assets, it may negatively affect its ability to generate revenues.\nCompetition\nFailure to develop and market new products and production technologies could impact Ashlands competitive position and have an adverse effect on its businesses and results of operations.\nThe specialty additives and materials industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements. In order to maintain margins and remain competitive, Ashland must successfully develop and introduce new products or improvements that appeal to its customers and ultimately to global consumers. Ashland plans to grow earnings, in part, by focusing on developing markets and solutions to meet increasing demand in those markets, including demand for personal care and pharmaceutical products which are subject to lengthy regulatory approval processes. The fast change in Ashlands industry and those of its customers necessitates that Ashland continue the development of new technologies to replace older technologies whose demand or market position may be fading. Ashlands efforts to respond to changes in customer demand in a timely and cost-efficient manner to drive growth could be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, including the inability to identify viable new products, successfully complete research and development, obtain regulatory approvals, obtain intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products. Due to the lengthy development process, technological challenges and intense competition, there can be no assurance that any of the products Ashland is currently developing, or could develop in the future, will achieve substantial commercial success.\nThe competitive nature of Ashlands markets may delay or prevent Ashland from passing increases in raw materials or energy costs on to its customers. In addition, certain of Ashlands suppliers may be unable to deliver products or raw materials or fulfill contractual requirements. The occurrence of either event could adversely affect Ashlands results of operations.\nRising and volatile raw material prices, especially those of hydrocarbon derivatives, cotton linters or wood pulp, may negatively impact Ashlands costs, results of operations and the valuation of its inventory. Similarly, energy costs are a significant component of certain of Ashlands product costs. Ashland is not always able to raise prices in response to such increased costs, and its ability to pass on the costs of such price increases is dependent upon market conditions. Likewise, reductions in the valuation of Ashlands inventory due to market volatility may not be recovered and could result in losses.\nAshland purchases certain products and raw materials from suppliers, often pursuant to written supply contracts. If those suppliers are unable to meet Ashlands orders in a timely manner or choose to terminate or not fulfill contractual arrangements, Ashland may not be able to make alternative supply arrangements. Also, domestic and global government regulations related to the manufacture, transport or import of certain raw materials may impede Ashlands ability to obtain those raw materials on commercially reasonable terms. Certain Ashland businesses rely on agricultural output of clary sage, aloe, guar, and cotton linters, and the availability of these materials can be severely impacted by crop yields, weather events, and other factors. If Ashland is unable to obtain and retain qualified suppliers under commercially acceptable terms, its ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely, competitive and profitable manner or grow its business successfully could be adversely affected.\nAshland faces competition from other companies, which places downward pressure on prices and margins and may adversely affect Ashlands businesses and results of operations.\nAshland operates in highly competitive markets, competing against a number of domestic and foreign companies. Competition is based on several key criteria, including product performance and quality, product price, product availability and security of supply, responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service, as well as the ability to bring innovative products or services to the marketplace. Certain key competitors are significantly larger than Ashland and have greater financial resources, leading to greater operating and financial flexibility. As a result, these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within the relevant industry, changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and changes in general economic conditions. In addition, competitors pricing decisions could compel Ashland to decrease its prices, which could negatively affect its margins and profitability. Additional competition in markets served by Ashland could adversely affect margins and profitability and could lead to a reduction in market share. Also, Ashland competes in certain markets that are declining and has targeted other markets for growth opportunities. Competitive and pricing pressures could also impact Ashlands production volumes, which can in turn reduce cost efficiency. If Ashlands strategies for dealing with declining markets and leveraging opportunity markets are not successful, its businesses and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nHuman Capital\nAshlands success depends upon its ability to attract and retain key employees and the identification and development of talent to succeed senior management.\nAshlands success depends on its ability to attract and retain key personnel, and Ashland relies heavily on its management team. The inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect Ashlands operations. Also, a substantial portion of Ashlands U.S.-based employees will be retirement-eligible within the next several years. That, combined with the relatively small number of middle tier managers with substantial experience in place to replace this group of retirement eligible employees, increases the potential negative impact of the risk that key employees could leave the Company. Additionally, the Companys redesign and cost reduction program may result in key employees departing who may not be replaced. This risk of unwanted employee turnover also is substantial in positions that require certain technical expertise and geographically in developing markets which Ashland has targeted for growth, especially in Asia, South America and Eastern Europe. In addition, because of its reliance on its management team, Ashlands future success depends, in part, on its ability to identify and develop talent to succeed its senior management and other key positions throughout the organization. If Ashland fails to identify and develop successors, the Company is at risk of being harmed by the departures of these key employees.\nIntellectual Property and Cyber Threats\nAshland uses information technology (IT) systems to conduct business and these IT systems are at risk of potential disruption and cyber security threats.\nAshlands businesses rely on their IT systems to operate efficiently and in some cases, to operate at all. Ashland employs third parties to manage and maintain a significant portion of its IT systems, including, but not limited to data centers, IT infrastructure, network, client support and end user services, as well as the functions of backing up and securing those systems. A partial or complete failure of Ashlands IT systems or those of our third parties managing, providing or servicing them for any amount of time more than several hours could result in significant business disruption causing harm to Ashlands reputation, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the nature of our businesses, the markets we serve, and the extensive geographic profile of our operations make Ashland a target of cyber security threats. Despite steps Ashland takes to mitigate or eliminate them, cyber security threats in general are increasing and becoming more advanced and could occur as a result of the activity of hackers, employee error or employee misconduct. A breach of our IT systems could lead to the loss and destruction of trade secrets, confidential information, proprietary data, intellectual property, customer and supplier data, and employee personal information, and could disrupt business operations which could adversely affect Ashlands relationships with business partners and harm our brands, reputation, and financial results.\nAshland may not be able to effectively protect or enforce its intellectual property rights.\nAshland relies on the patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws of the United States and other countries to protect its intellectual property rights. The laws of some countries may not protect Ashlands intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Failure of foreign countries to have laws to protect Ashlands intellectual property rights or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could result in the loss of valuable proprietary information, which could have an adverse effect on Ashlands business and results of operations.\nEven in circumstances where Ashland has a patent on certain technologies, such patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competing technologies. In addition, any patent applications submitted by Ashland may not result in an issued patent. There can be no assurance that Ashlands intellectual property rights will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. Ashland could also face claims from third parties alleging that Ashlands products or processes infringe on their proprietary rights. If Ashland is found liable for infringement, it could be responsible for significant damages, prohibited from using certain products or processes or required to modify certain products and processes. Any such infringement liability could adversely affect Ashlands product and service offerings, profitability and results of operations.\nAshland also has substantial intellectual property associated with its know-how and trade secrets that are not protected by patent or copyright laws. Ashland protects these rights by entering into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with most of its employees and with third parties. There can be no assurance that such agreements will not be breached or that Ashland will be able to effectively enforce them. In addition, Ashlands trade secrets and know-how may be improperly obtained by other means, such as a breach of Ashlands information technologies security systems or direct theft. Any unauthorized disclosure of any of Ashlands material know-how or trade secrets could adversely affect Ashlands business and results of operations.\nLegal Risks, Regulatory Compliance and Litigation\nAshlands business exposes it to potential product liability claims and recalls, which could adversely affect its financial condition and performance.\nThe development, manufacture and sale of specialty materials and other products by Ashland, including products produced for the food, beverage, personal care, pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement industries, involve an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, product recalls, product seizures and related adverse publicity. Ashland also produces products that are subject to rigorous specifications and quality standards, with an expectation from its customers around these strict requirements. A product liability claim, recall or judgment against Ashland, or a customer complaint on product specifications, could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, affect consumer or customer confidence in its products, and divert managements attention from other responsibilities. Although Ashland maintains product liability insurance, there can be no\nassurance that this type or level of coverage is adequate or that Ashland will be able to continue to maintain its existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. A product recall or a partially or completely uninsured product liability judgment against Ashland could have a material adverse effect on its reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nAshland has incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial costs as a result of environmental, health and safety, and hazardous substances liabilities and related compliance requirements. These costs could adversely impact Ashlands cash flow, and, to the extent they exceed Ashlands established reserves for these liabilities, its results of operations.\nAshland is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment and human health and safety, and the generation, storage, handling, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. Ashland has incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs and capital expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations.\nEnvironmental, health and safety regulations change frequently, and such regulations and their enforcement have tended to become more stringent over time. Accordingly, changes in environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and the enforcement of such laws and regulations could interrupt Ashlands operations, require modifications to its facilities or cause Ashland to incur significant liabilities, costs or losses that could adversely affect its profitability. Actual or alleged violations of environmental, health or safety laws and regulations could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations as well as substantial damages, penalties, fines, civil or criminal sanctions and remediation costs. In addition, under some environmental laws, Ashland may be strictly liable and/or jointly and severally liable for environmental damages and penalties.\nAshland is also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts (collectively, environmental remediation) at multiple locations. Ashland uses engineering studies, historical experience and other factors to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation. Environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect Ashlands ability to estimate its share of the applicable costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods, changes in environmental regulations, the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites. There may also be situations in which certain environmental liabilities are not known to Ashland or are not probable and estimable. As a result, Ashlands actual costs for environmental remediation could affect Ashlands cash flow and, to the extent costs exceed established reserves for those liabilities, its results of operations.\nAshland is responsible for, and has financial exposure to, liabilities from pending and threatened claims, including those alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos, which could adversely impact Ashlands results of operations and cash flow.\nThere are various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings pending or threatened, including those alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos, against Ashland and its current and former subsidiaries. Such actions are with respect to commercial matters, product liability, toxic tort liability and other matters that seek remedies or damages, some of which are for substantial amounts. While these actions are being contested, their outcome is not predictable. Ashlands results could be adversely affected by financial exposure to these liabilities. Insurance maintained by Ashland to protect against claims for damages alleged by third parties is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of Ashlands liabilities to others. In addition, insurance related to these types of risks may not be available now or, if available, may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable rates. Ashlands ability to recover from its insurers for asbestos liabilities could also have an adverse impact on its results of operations. Projecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict. In addition to the significant uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received, other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant, the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure, dismissal rates, costs of medical treatment, the impact of bankruptcies of other companies that are co-defendants in claims, uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards. Furthermore, any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. In light of these inherent uncertainties, Ashland believes that its asbestos reserves represent the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes. As a part of the process to develop these estimates of future asbestos costs, a range of long-term cost models was developed. These models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long-term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs, as well as other variables mentioned previously. Because of the inherent uncertainties in projecting future asbestos liabilities and establishing appropriate reserves, Ashlands actual asbestos costs could adversely affect its results of operations and, to the extent they exceed its reserves, could adversely affect its results of operations.\nThe impact of changing laws or regulations or the manner of interpretation or enforcement of existing rules could adversely impact Ashlands financial performance and restrict its ability to operate its business or execute its strategies.\nNew laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase Ashlands cost of doing business and restrict its ability to operate its business or execute its strategies. This includes, among other things, the possible taxation under U.S. law of certain income from foreign operations, the possible taxation under foreign laws of certain income Ashland reports in other jurisdictions, tariffs or quotas levied on Ashland products, raw materials or key components by certain countries, regulations related to the protection of private information of Ashlands employees and customers, regulations issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (and analogous non-U.S. agencies) affecting Ashland and its customers, compliance with The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (and analogous non-U.S. laws) and the European Unions Registration, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation (and analogous non-EU initiatives), and potential operational impacts of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Uncertainty associated with the passage of new laws, application of executive authority beyond the legislative process, as well as changes in and enforcement of existing laws, can limit Ashlands ability to make and execute business plans effectively. In addition, compliance with laws and regulations is complicated by Ashlands substantial and growing global footprint, which will require significant and additional resources to comprehend and ensure compliance with applicable laws in the more than one hundred countries where Ashland conducts business. Compliance with current and future regulations is further complicated by uncertainty around the reevaluation of international agreements by various countries, including the United States, and the resulting impact on regulatory regimes, customs regulations, tariffs, sanctions, and other transnational protocols.\nTaxation\nImposition of new taxes, disagreements with tax authorities or additional tax liabilities could adversely affect Ashlands business, financial condition, reputation or results of operations.\nAshlands products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold in more than 100 countries and territories. A significant portion of Ashlands revenues are generated outside the United States. As such, Ashland is subject to taxes in the United States as well as numerous foreign countries. Ashlands future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in liabilities for uncertain tax positions, cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices or their interpretation. Moreover, because Ashland is subject to the regular examination of its income tax returns by various tax authorities, the economic and political pressure to increase tax revenues in these jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes even more difficult, and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation may differ from our historical provisions and accruals resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, reputation or results of operations. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), enacted in December 2017, made significant changes to US tax law; many other countries or organizations, including those where Ashland has significant operations, are actively considering or enacting changes to tax laws which could significantly impact our tax rate and cash flows. The increasingly complex global tax environment, including changes in how United States multinational corporations are taxed, could adversely affect Ashlands business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOther than the one-time transition tax enacted by the Tax Act, Ashland will continue to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign earnings. As such, Ashland has not accrued income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most non-US subsidiaries because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. If these earnings are needed for Ashlands operations in the United States, the repatriation of such earnings could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe IPO of Valvoline and final distribution of its shares could result in significant tax liability to Ashland and its stockholders.\nAshland believes that the Valvoline IPO and certain related internal transactions should be nontaxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes and has obtained written opinions of counsel to that effect. Ashland also obtained a written opinion of counsel to the effect that the final distribution should qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). The opinions are based on certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters from Ashland and Valvoline, as well as certain covenants by those parties. The opinions cannot be relied upon if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or is violated in any material respect, or if there are changes in law with retroactive effect. The opinions are not binding on the IRS or the courts, and it is possible that the IRS or a state or local taxing authority could take the position that the internal transactions, the final distribution or the receipt of proceeds from the Valvoline IPO resulted in the recognition of significant taxable gain by Ashland, in which case Ashland may be subject to material tax liabilities.\nIf the final distribution were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss, then Ashland would recognize gain as if it had sold Valvoline common stock in a taxable transaction in an amount up to the fair market value of the Valvoline common stock it distributed in the final distribution. The tax liability resulting from such gain could have a material impact on Ashlands operations. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nAshlands corporate headquarters is located in Wilmington, Delaware. Principal offices of other major operations are located in Wilmington, Delaware (Life Sciences, Specialty Additives, Intermediates and Corporate); Bridgewater, New Jersey (Personal Care and Corporate); and Dublin, Ohio (Corporate) within the United States and Hyderabad, India; Warsaw, Poland; and Schaffhausen, Switzerland (each of which are shared service centers of Ashlands and house Corporate and direct business segment personnel). All of these locations are leased, except for the Wilmington, Delaware site which is owned. Principal manufacturing, marketing and other materially important physical properties of Ashland and its subsidiaries are described within the applicable business units under Item 1 in this annual report on Form 10-K. All of Ashlands physical properties are owned or leased. Ashland believes its physical properties are suitable and adequate for the Companys business. Additional information concerning leases may be found in Note K of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10-K. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThe following is a description of Ashlands material legal proceedings. Ashlands threshold for disclosing material environmental legal proceedings involving a governmental authority where potential monetary sanctions are involved is $1 million.\nAsbestos-Related Litigation\nAshland is subject to liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Such claims result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in 1990 in connection with the sale of Riley Stoker Corporation (Riley), a former subsidiary. Although Riley was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos, its industrial boilers contained some asbestos containing components provided by other companies.\nHercules LLC (Hercules) (formerly Hercules Incorporated), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Ashland, is also subject to liabilities from asbestos-related personal injury lawsuits involving claims which typically arise from alleged exposure to asbestos fibers from resin encapsulated pipe and tank products which were sold by one of Hercules former subsidiaries to a limited industrial market.\nAshland and Hercules are also defendants in lawsuits alleging exposure to asbestos at facilities formerly or presently owned or operated by Ashland or Hercules.\nFor additional detailed information regarding liabilities arising from asbestos-related litigation, see Managements Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies - Asbestos Litigation and Note N of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nEnvironmental Proceedings\n(a) CERCLA and Similar State Law Sites - Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state laws, Ashland and its subsidiaries may be subject to joint and several liability for cleanup costs in connection with alleged releases of hazardous substances at sites where it has been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP). As of September 30, 2022, Ashland and its subsidiaries have been identified as a PRP by U.S. federal and state authorities, or by private parties seeking contribution, for the cost of environmental investigation and/or cleanup at 81 sites. These sites are currently subject to ongoing investigation and remedial activities, overseen by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) or a state agency, in which Ashland or its subsidiaries are typically participating as a member of a PRP group. Generally, the types of relief sought include remediation of contaminated soil and/or groundwater, reimbursement for past costs of site cleanup and administrative oversight and/or long-term monitoring of environmental conditions at the sites. The ultimate costs are not predictable with assurance.\n(b) Lower Passaic River, New Jersey Matters - Ashland, through two formerly owned facilities, and International Specialty Products (ISP), through a now-closed facility, have been identified as PRPs, along with approximately 70 other companies (the Cooperating Parties Group or the CPG), in a May 2007 Administrative Order of Consent (AOOC) with the USEPA. The parties\nare required to perform a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) of the entire 17 miles of the Passaic River. In June 2007, the USEPA separately commenced a Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) as an interim measure. In accordance with the 2007 AOOC, in June 2012 the CPG voluntarily entered into another AOOC for an interim removal action focused solely at mile 10.9 of the Passaic River. The allocations for the 2007 AOOC and the 2012 removal action are based on interim allocations, are immaterial and have been accrued. In April 2014, the USEPA released the FFS. The CPG submitted the Draft RI/FS Report on April 30, 2015. The USEPA has released the FFS Record of Decision for the lower 8 miles and reached an agreement with another chemical company to conduct and pay for the remedial design. This chemical company has sued Ashland, ISP and numerous other defendants to recover past and future costs pursuant to the CERCLA. Ashlands motion to dismiss was partially granted, and the surviving claims are in the early stages of discovery. Ashland and ISP participated in an USEPA allocation process that resulted in a partial settlement with the EPA. Possible future allocation proceedings and the lawsuit are not expected to be material to Ashland.\nFor additional information regarding environmental matters and reserves, see Note N of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nOther Pending Legal Proceedings\nIn addition to the matters described above, there are other various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings pending or threatened against Ashland and its current and former subsidiaries. Such actions are with respect to commercial matters, product liability, toxic tort liability, employment matters and other environmental matters which seek remedies or damages, some of which are for substantial amounts. While Ashland cannot predict with certainty the outcome of such actions, it believes that adequate reserves have been recorded and losses already recognized with respect to such actions were immaterial as of September 30, 2022. There is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized may be incurred related to these actions; however, Ashland believes that such potential losses were immaterial as of September 30, 2022.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nAshland profile\nAshland is a global specialty additives and materials company with a conscious and proactive mindset for sustainability. The company serves customers in a wide range of consumer and industrial markets including architectural coatings, construction, energy, food and beverage, nutraceuticals, personal care and pharmaceutical. With approximately 3,900 employees worldwide, Ashland serves customers in more than 100 countries.\nAshlands sales generated outside of North America were 68% in 2022 and 2021, and 67% in 2020. respectively. Sales by region expressed as a percentage of total consolidated sales were as follows:\nSales by Geography\nNorth America (a)\n%\n%\n%\nEurope (a)\n%\n%\n%\nAsia Pacific\n%\n%\n%\nLatin America & other\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n(a)\tAshland includes only U.S. and Canada in its North American designation and includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa in its Europe designation.\nReportable segments\nAshlands reportable segments include Life Sciences, Personal Care, Specialty Additives and Intermediates. Unallocated and Other includes corporate governance activities and certain legacy matters. The contribution to sales by each reportable segment expressed as a percentage of total consolidated sales for the year ended September 30 were as follows:\nSales by Reportable Segment\nLife Sciences\n%\n%\n%\nPersonal Care\n%\n%\n%\nSpecialty Additives\n%\n%\n%\nIntermediates\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\nKEY DEVELOPMENTS\nBusiness Results\nAshlands net income was $927 million ($181 million income from continuing operations and $746 million income from discontinued operations) in 2022 compared to income of $220 million ($173 million income from continuing operations and $47 million income from discontinued operations) in 2021. Results for Ashlands continuing operations for 2022 and 2021 were impacted by restructuring costs of $5 million in 2022 and $10 million in 2021, environmental reserve adjustments of $53 million in 2022 and $45 million in 2021, and unrealized losses of $102 million and unrealized gains of $21 million on restricted investment securities. Fiscal 2022 also included $42 million of gains associated with the sale of two excess and unused parcels of land and a $22 million gain on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements. Additionally, the prior year included $17 million of debt restructuring costs, $13 million restructuring related impairment charges, and a $4 million charge for inventory adjustments. Discontinued operations were primarily driven by the change in results of the Performance Adhesives business including the $726 million gain as a result of the sale of that business during fiscal 2022. Ashlands Adjusted EBITDA is $590 million for the current year compared to $495 million in the prior year (see U.S. GAAP reconciliation under consolidated review). The $95 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by disciplined pricing leading to cost recovery in a high-inflation environment and improved product mix partially offset by higher raw material and operating costs, unfavorable currency exchange and higher selling, general and administration costs.\nM-1\nUncertainty relating to the Ukraine and Russia conflict\nBusiness disruptions, including those related to the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia continue to impact businesses around the globe. While it is impossible to predict the effects of the conflict such as possible escalating geopolitical tensions (including the imposition of existing and additional sanctions by the U.S and the European Union on Russia), worsening macroeconomic and general business conditions, supply chain interruptions and unfavorable energy markets, the impact could be material. Ashland is closely monitoring the situation and maintains business continuity plans that are intended to continue operations or mitigate the effects of events that could disrupt its business.\nAshland does not have manufacturing operations in Russia, Ukraine, or Belarus. Ashland sells (or previously sold) additives and specialty ingredients to manufacturers in these countries for their use in pharmaceuticals, personal care, and coatings applications. Sales to Russia and Belarus were previously limited and our products were primarily used in products and applications that are essential to the population's wellbeing and currently support our customers' humanitarian efforts. We have sales controls in place to ensure that future potential sales into the region are only to support critical pharmaceutical or personal hygiene products which are essential for the general population and in accordance with any applicable sanctions. Sales to Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus represent less than 1% of total consolidated sales and less than 1% of total consolidated assets (related to accounts receivable).\nUncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic\nAshland continues to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of its business and geographies, including how it will impact customers, employees, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels. Ashland is unable to predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on its future financial position and operating results due to numerous uncertainties. These uncertainties include the severity of the virus and any variants, the duration of the outbreak, governmental, business or other actions, impacts on Ashlands supply chain, the effect on customer demand, or changes to Ashlands operations. The health of Ashlands workforce and its ability to meet staffing needs throughout the critical functions cannot be predicted and is vital to operations. Further, the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets, consumer spending as well as other unanticipated consequences remain unknown. In addition, Ashland cannot predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on its customers, vendors, suppliers and other business partners; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact Ashland.\nAshland continues to successfully navigate the uncertain environment associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Through fiscal year 2022, Ashland has not experienced any additional major operating surprises related to the COVID-19 pandemic, continues to maintain supply chains in a challenging environment, had strong safety performance in the face of unprecedented pressures and improved operating discipline across each of its businesses. Ashland businesses continue to show resiliency in the face of difficult economic circumstances. While sales were up in the year period-over-period, continued supply-chain and labor-shortage challenges inhibited Ashland's ability to meet strong overall customer demand. Ashlands overall liquidity remains strong and Ashland is more than able to meet its operating cash needs and other investing and financing cash requirements at this time, including those necessary to grow the business as economic conditions improve.\nThe situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic remains fluid, and Ashland is actively managing its response in collaboration with customers, government officials, team members and business partners. For further information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, please see Item 1A, Risk Factors in this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nOther significant items\nPerformance Adhesives\nAshland completed the sale of its Performance Adhesives business segment on February 28, 2022, resulting in proceeds to Ashland of approximately $1.7 billion, net of transaction costs. Ashland recognized an after-tax gain of $726 million within the income from discontinued operations caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 related to the sale of Performance Adhesives. Since this transaction represented a strategic\nM-2\nshift in Ashlands business and had a major effect on Ashlands operations and financial results, the operating results and cash flows related to Performance Adhesives have been reflected as discontinued operations in the statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Statements of Condensed Consolidated Cash Flows. See Note C of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Certain indirect corporate costs included within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) that were previously allocated to the Performance Adhesives segment do not qualify for classification within discontinued operations and are now reported as selling, general and administrative expense within continuing operations on a consolidated basis and within the Unallocated and other segment. These costs were $9 million, $15 million, and $20 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nDebt Repayment Activities\nAshland used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of its Performance Adhesives segment to prepay $250 million of principal on its Term loan A, reduce $240 million of outstanding borrowing under the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility, reduce $102 million of outstanding borrowing under the Foreign Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility, and repay the $23 million outstanding balance on its European short-term loan facility during 2022.\n2022 Stock repurchase program\nOn May 25, 2022, Ashland's board of directors authorized a new, evergreen $500 million common share repurchase program (2022 stock repurchase program). The new authorization terminates and replaces the company's 2018 $1 billion share repurchase program, which had $150 million outstanding at the date of termination.\n2018 Stock repurchase program\nIn September 2021, under the 2018 stock repurchase program, Ashland entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (2021 ASR Agreement). Under the 2021 ASR Agreement, Ashland paid an initial purchase price of $450 million and received an initial delivery of 3.9 million shares of common stock during September 2021. The bank exercised its early termination option under the 2021 ASR Agreement in February 2022, and an additional 0.7 million shares were repurchased, bringing the total shares repurchased upon settlement to 4.6 million.\nOn March 1, 2022, under the 2018 stock repurchase program, Ashland entered into an agreement to repurchase an aggregate amount of $200 million of Ashland common stock using open-market purchases under rule 10b-18. On April 8, 2022, Ashland completed repurchases under this agreement repurchasing a total of 2.15 million shares for a total amount of $200 million.\nOperational business model changes and restructurings\nAs previously disclosed, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, Ashland changed the manner in which it manages the business moving from a functionally led to a business led organization. This new business-centric operational model required redesign of core operating systems and processes leading to a realignment in both the selling, general and administrative and research and development costs (SARD) associated with each business. In addition to the realignment of SARD, a productivity review with a focus on cost of goods sold (COGS) was also initiated. Based on these initiatives, Ashland targeted the following savings:\n$50 million of incremental SARD cost savings\n$50 million of incremental COGS productivity savings\nAs of September 30, 2022, Ashland has achieved all of its target run-rate cost savings under these initiatives.\nM-3\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONSOLIDATED REVIEW\nConsolidated review\nNet income\nAshlands net income (loss) is primarily affected by results within operating income (loss), net interest and other expense, other net periodic benefit income (loss), net income (loss) on acquisitions and divestitures, income tax expense (benefit), discontinued operations and other significant events or transactions that are unusual or nonrecurring.\nKey financial results for 2022, 2021 and 2020 included the following:\nAshlands net income/loss amounted to income of $927 million in 2022, income of $220 million in 2021 and loss of $508 million in 2020, or income of $16.41, income of $3.59 and loss of $8.39 diluted earnings per share, respectively.\nDiscontinued operations, which are reported net of taxes, resulted in income of $746 million in 2022, and $47 million each in 2021 and 2020. Fiscal 2022 includes a $726 million gain associated with the sale of the Performance Adhesives business.\nResults from continuing operations, which excludes results from discontinued operations, amounted to income of $181 million and $173 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, and loss of $555 million in 2020. Fiscal 2020 includes a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $530 million.\nThe effective income tax was an income tax expense rate of 12% for 2022, and income tax benefit rates of 28% and 4% for 2021 and 2020, respectively. These rates were impacted by certain tax specific key items and tax discrete items.\nAshland incurred pre-tax net interest and other expense of $149 million, $56 million and $119 million during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This includes charges for $16 million and $59 million for debt refinancing costs during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $1 million and $8 million for accelerated debt issuance costs during 2021 and 2020, respectively, as well as losses of $102 million and gains of $21 million, and $20 million on restricted investments during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOther net periodic benefit income (loss) totaled income of $22 million during 2022, loss of $1 million in 2021, and income of $3 million in 2020.\nOperating income/loss amounted to income of $333 million and $192 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, and loss of $461 million in 2020. Fiscal 2020 included a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $530 million.\nFor further information on the items reported above, see the discussion in the comparative Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) caption review analysis.\nOperating income\nOperating income/loss was income of $333 million in 2022 compared to income of $192 million and a loss of $461 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The current and prior years operating income included certain key items that were excluded to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA and are quantified in the table below in the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA section. These operating key items for the applicable periods are summarized as follows:\nRestructuring, separation and other costs - Ashland periodically implements company-wide cost reduction programs related to acquisitions, divestitures and other cost reduction programs in order to enhance profitability through streamlined operations and an improved overall cost structure. Ashland often incurs severance, facility and integration costs associated with these programs. See Note E in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the restructuring activities.\nEnvironmental reserve adjustments - Ashland is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts (collectively environmental remediation) at multiple locations. As a result of these activities, Ashland recorded adjustments during each year to its environmental\nM-4\nliabilities and receivables primarily related to previously divested businesses or non-operational sites. See Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nIncome/loss on acquisitions/divestitures - Ashland recorded income of $42 million during 2022 related to pre-tax gains related to the sale of excess corporate property, and $11 million during 2021. The income in 2021 includes $3 million of expense relating to the Sch\u00fclke acquisition and a $14 million gain related to the sale of a Specialty Additives facility.\nInventory adjustments - During 2021, Ashland recorded non-cash charges related to the fair value adjustment of inventory acquired from Sch\u00fclke at the date of acquisition during the current year. During 2020, Ashland incurred charges associated with a program to reduce overall inventory levels as part of a working capital efficiency program. While successful in managing inventory levels, these actions resulted in increased expense primarily related to abnormal production variances due to plant shutdowns.\nAsset impairments - Ashland recognized impairment charges to certain assets during 2021. See Note E of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nGoodwill impairment - During 2020, Ashland realigned its operations into five reportable segments which resulted in a reassessment of the Companys reporting units used to evaluate goodwill impairment. The impairment test under the new reporting unit structure concluded that the carrying value of the Personal Care and the Specialty Additives reporting units exceeded their fair value, resulting in a $530 million non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in 2020. See note H and Critical Accounting Policies for additional information.\nOperating income/loss for 2022, 2021 and 2020 included depreciation and amortization of $241 million, $244 million and $235 million, respectively.\nNon-operating key items affecting EBITDA\nDuring the current and prior years, there were certain key items that were not included in operating income but were excluded to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA. These non-operating key items for the applicable periods are summarized as follows:\nGain/loss on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements - Ashland recognized actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year. See Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nStatements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) - caption review\nA comparative analysis of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) by caption is provided as follows for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n(In millions)\nchange\nchange\nSales\n$\n2,391\n$\n2,111\n$\n2,016\n$\n$\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the change in sales between fiscal years 2022 and 2021 and between fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\n(In millions)\n2022 change\n2021 change\nVolume\n$\n$\n(3\n)\nProduct pricing/mix\nCurrency exchange\n(77\n)\nAcquisition\nChange in sales\n$\n$\nM-5\nSales for 2022 increased $280 million, or 13%, compared to 2021. Favorable volume, including the acquisition of Sch\u00fclke within the Personal Care reportable segment, and product pricing/mix associated with cost inflation pricing actions increased sales by $68 million and $289 million, respectively, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange of $77 million.\nSales for 2021 increased $95 million, or 5%, compared to 2020. The acquisition of Sch\u00fclke within the Personal Care reportable segment, product pricing/mix and foreign currency exchange increased sales by $32 million, $20 million and $46 million, respectively.

Tax specific key items are defined as the financial effects from tax specific financial transactions, tax law changes or other matters that fall within the definition of key items as previously described. The effective tax rate, excluding key items, which is a non-GAAP measure, has been prepared to illustrate the ongoing tax effects of Ashlands operations. Management believes investors and analysts use this financial measure in assessing Ashland's business performance and that presenting this non-GAAP measure on a consolidated basis assists investors in better understanding Ashlands ongoing business performance and enhancing their ability to compare period-to-period financial results.\nThe effective tax rates during 2022, 2021 and 2020 were significantly impacted by the following tax specific key items:\nUncertain tax position - Includes the impact from the settlement of uncertain tax positions with various tax authorities;\nValuation allowances - Includes the impact from the release of certain foreign tax credit valuation allowances during 2022; and\nRestructuring and separation activity - Includes the impact from company-wide cost reduction programs, and the impact of the sale of a Specialty Additives facility.\nM-9\nThe following table is a calculation of the effective tax rate, excluding the impact of these key items:\n(In millions)\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations\nbefore income taxes\n$\n$\n$\n(577\n)\nKey items (pre-tax) (a)\nAdjusted income from continuing operations\nbefore income taxes\n$\n$\n$\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n(38\n)\n(22\n)\nIncome tax rate adjustments:\nTax effect of key items (b)\nTax specific key items: (c)\nUncertain tax positions\n(3\n)\nValuation allowance\n-\n-\nRestructuring and separation activity\n(3\n)\n-\nOther tax reform related activity\n-\n(6\n)\nTotal income tax rate adjustments\nAdjusted income tax expense (benefit)\n$\n$\n$\nEffective tax rate, excluding key items (Non-GAAP) (d)\n%\n%\n%\n(a)See Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table disclosed below in this Management, Discussion and Analysis for a summary of the key items, before tax.\n(b)The tax rate specific to the jurisdiction in which the key item originates is used to calculate the tax effect of key items.\n(c)For additional information on the effect that these tax specific key items had on EPS, see the Adjusted Diluted EPS table disclosed below in this Management Discussion and Analysis.\n(d)Due to rounding conventions, the effective tax rate presented may not recalculate precisely based on the numbers disclosed within this table.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of tax specific key items within the statutory federal income tax with the provision for income taxes summary disclosed in Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(In millions)\nTax effect of key items computed at applicable statutory rate (a)\n$\n$\n$\nTax reform\n-\n-\nUncertain tax positions\n(4\n)\nDeemed inclusions, foreign dividends and other restructuring\n-\n-\n(4\n)\nValuation allowance changes\n(8\n)\n-\nOther items\n(3\n)\n-\n$\n$\n$\n(In millions)\nchange\nchange\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations (net of taxes)\nPerformance Adhesives\n$\n$\n$\n$\n(23\n)\n$\n-\nComposites and Marl Facility\n-\n(4\n)\nAsbestos-related litigation\n(14\n)\n(9\n)\n(18\n)\n(5\n)\nWater Technologies\n(3\n)\n-\n(3\n)\nDistribution\n(7\n)\n(5\n)\n(8\n)\n(2\n)\nValvoline\n(6\n)\n(24\n)\n(9\n)\nGain (loss) on disposal of discontinued operations\nPerformance Adhesives\n-\n-\n-\nComposites/Marl facility\n-\n(4\n)\n(33\n)\nWater Technologies\n-\n-\n(1\n)\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n-\nAs a result of the divestiture of the Performance Adhesives segment and the divestiture of the Composites segment (including the Maleic business) and Marl facility, the related operating results have been reflected as discontinued operations (net of tax) within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). See Note C for more information on these transactions. In\nM-10\n2022, the sales and pre-tax income included in discontinued operations were $171 million and $33 million, respectively, for the Performance Adhesives segment. In 2021, the sales and pre-tax income included in discontinued operations were $372 million and $83 million, respectively, for the Performance Adhesives segment. In 2020, the sales and pre-tax income included in discontinued operations were $310 million and $74 million for the Performance Adhesives segment, respectively, and $51 million and $9 million for the Composites segment (including the Maleic business) and Marl Facility, respectively. In 2022, a $726 million gain on disposal was recorded associated with the February 28, 2022 closing of the Performance Adhesives business segment divestiture.

See Note F for more information.\nM-11\nUse of non-GAAP measures\nAshland has included within this document the following non-GAAP measures, on both a consolidated and reportable segment basis, which are not defined within U.S. GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of operating performance or cash flows:\nEBITDA - net income (loss), plus income tax expense (benefit), net interest and other expenses, and depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA - EBITDA adjusted for discontinued operations and key items (including remeasurement gains and losses related to pension and other postretirement plans).\nAdjusted EBITDA margin - Adjusted EBITDA divided by sales.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) - income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted for key items, net of tax, divided by the average outstanding diluted shares for the applicable period.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) excluding intangibles amortization expense - Adjusted earnings per share adjusted for intangibles amortization expense net of tax, divided by the average outstanding diluted shares for the applicable period.\nFree cash flow - operating cash flows less capital expenditures.\nOngoing free cash flow - operating cash flows less capital expenditures and certain other adjustments as applicable.\nOngoing free cash flow conversion - ongoing free cash flow divided by adjusted EBITDA.\nManagement believes the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures on a consolidated and reportable segment basis assists investors in understanding the ongoing operating performance by presenting comparable financial results between periods. Ashland believes that by removing the impact of depreciation and amortization and excluding certain non-cash charges, amounts spent on interest and taxes and certain other charges that are highly variable from year to year, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide Ashlands investors with performance measures that reflect the impact to operations from trends in changes in sales, margin and operating expenses, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income and operating income. The adjustments Ashland makes to derive the non-GAAP measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude items which may cause short-term fluctuations in net income and operating income and which Ashland does not consider to be the fundamental attributes or primary drivers of its business. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide disclosure on the same basis as that used by Ashlands management to evaluate financial performance on a consolidated and reportable segment basis and provide consistency in our financial reporting, facilitate internal and external comparisons of Ashlands historical operating performance and its segments and provide continuity to investors for comparability purposes.\nThe Adjusted diluted EPS metric enables Ashland to demonstrate what effect key items have on an earnings per diluted share basis by taking income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted for key items after tax that have been identified in the Adjusted EBITDA table, and dividing by the average outstanding diluted shares for the applicable period. Ashlands management believes this presentation is helpful to illustrate how the key items have impacted this metric during the applicable period.\nThe Adjusted diluted EPS, excluding intangibles amortization expense metric enables Ashland to demonstrate the impact of non-cash intangibles amortization expense on EPS, in addition to the key items previously mentioned. Ashlands management believes this presentation is helpful to illustrate how previous acquisitions impact applicable period results.\nThe free cash flow metrics enable Ashland to provide a better indication of the ongoing cash being generated that is ultimately available for both debt and equity holders as well as other investment opportunities. Unlike cash flow provided by operating activities, free cash flow and ongoing free cash flow includes the impact of capital expenditures from continuing operations and other significant items impacting cash flow, providing a more complete picture of current and future cash generation. Free cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not reflect adjustment for certain non-discretionary cash flows such as mandatory debt repayments. The amount of mandatory versus discretionary expenditures can vary significantly between periods.\nM-12\nAlthough Ashland may provide forward-looking guidance for Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted EPS and ongoing free cash flow, Ashland is not reaffirming or providing forward-looking guidance for U.S. GAAP-reported financial measures or a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items that affect these metrics such as domestic and international economic, political, legislative, regulatory and legal actions. In addition, certain economic conditions, such as recessionary trends, inflation, interest and monetary exchange rates, government fiscal policies and changes in the prices of certain key raw materials, can have a significant effect on operations and are difficult to predict with certainty.\nThese non-GAAP measures should be considered supplemental in nature and should not be construed as more significant than comparable measures defined by U.S. GAAP. Limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP measures include that these measures do not present all of the amounts associated with our results as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP measures provided are used by Ashland management and may not be determined in a manner consistent with the methodologies used by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide a supplemental presentation of Ashlands operating performance on a consolidated and reportable segment basis. Adjusted EBITDA generally includes adjustments for items that impact comparability between periods. In addition, certain financial covenants related to Ashlands 2022 Credit Agreement are based on similar non-GAAP measures and are defined further in the sections that reference this metric.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, Ashland recognizes actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year. Actuarial gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from the estimates used to allocate the change in value of pension and other postretirement benefit plans to expense throughout the year or when assumptions change, as they may each year. Significant factors that can contribute to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses include changes in discount rates used to remeasure pension and other postretirement obligations on an annual basis or upon a qualifying remeasurement, differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets and other changes in actuarial assumptions, for example, the life expectancy of plan participants. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA, which includes the expected return on pension plan assets yet excludes both the actual return on pension plan assets and the impact of actuarial gains and losses, provides investors with a meaningful supplemental presentation of Ashlands operating performance (see the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table for additional details on exact amounts included within this non-GAAP measure related to pension and other postretirement plans). Management believes these actuarial gains and losses are primarily financing activities that are more reflective of changes in current conditions in global financial markets (and in particular interest rates) that are not directly related to the underlying business. For further information on the actuarial assumptions and plan assets referenced above, see Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nM-13\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA totaled income of $1,342 million, income of $482 million and a loss of $176 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA results in the following table have been prepared to illustrate the ongoing effects of Ashlands operations, which exclude certain key items previously described. Management believes the use of such non-GAAP measures on a consolidated and reportable segment basis assists investors in understanding the ongoing operating performance by presenting the financial results between periods on a more comparable basis.\n(In millions)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n$\n$\n(508\n)\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n(38\n)\n(22\n)\nNet interest and other financing expense\nDepreciation and amortization\nEBITDA\n1,342\n(176\n)\nIncome from discontinued operations (net of taxes)\n(746\n)\n(47\n)\n(47\n)\nKey items included in EBITDA:\nGoodwill impairment\n-\n-\nRestructuring, separation and other costs\nEnvironmental reserve adjustments\nInventory adjustments\n-\nAsset impairments\n-\n-\nIncome on acquisitions and divestitures (a)\n(42\n)\n(11\n)\n-\nLoss (gain) on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements\n(22\n)\n(1\n)\nTotal key items included in EBITDA\n(6\n)\nAdjusted EBITDA (b)\n$\n$\n$\nTotal key items included in EBITDA\n$\n(6\n)\n$\n$\nAccelerated amortization of debt issuance costs\n-\nDebt refinancing costs (c)\n-\nUnrealized (gain) loss on securities\n(21\n)\n(20\n)\nTotal key items, before tax\n$\n$\n$\n(a)Excludes income of $2 million during 2020, related to ongoing adjustments of previous divestiture transactions.\n(b)Includes $8 million, $6 million and $4 million during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of net periodic pension and other postretirement expense recognized ratably through the fiscal year.

Debt refinancing costs during 2020 included $59 million loss on early retirement of debt.

See Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nM-14\nDiluted EPS and Adjusted Diluted EPS\nThe following table reflects the U.S. GAAP calculation for the income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for the cumulative diluted EPS effect for key items after tax that have been identified in the Adjusted EBITDA table in the previous section. Key items are defined as the financial effects from significant transactions that may have caused short-term fluctuations in net income and/or operating income which Ashland believes do not accurately reflect Ashlands underlying business performance and trends. The Adjusted Diluted EPS for the income (loss) from continuing operations and Adjusted Diluted EPS from continuing operations excluding intangibles amortization expense in the following table have been prepared to illustrate these ongoing effects on Ashlands operations. Management believes investors and analysts use this financial measure in assessing Ashland's business performance and that presenting this non-GAAP measure on a consolidated basis assists investors in better understanding Ashlands ongoing business performance and enhancing their ability to compare period-to-period financial results.\nDiluted EPS from continuing operations (as reported)\n$\n3.20\n$\n2.82\n$\n(9.16\n)\nKey items, before tax:\nGoodwill impairment\n-\n-\n8.75\nRestructuring, separation and other costs (including accelerated depreciation)\n0.09\n0.16\n0.95\nEnvironmental reserve adjustments\n0.95\n0.70\n0.58\nInventory adjustments\n-\n0.07\n0.83\nAsset impairments\n-\n0.21\n-\nIncome on acquisitions and divestitures\n(0.75\n)\n(0.18\n)\n-\nLoss (gain) on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements\n(0.40\n)\n0.02\n(0.01\n)\nUnrealized gain on securities\n1.82\n(0.34\n)\n(0.33\n)\nAccelerated amortization of debt issuance costs\n-\n0.02\n0.13\nDebt refinancing costs\n-\n0.26\n0.97\nKey items, before tax\n1.71\n0.92\n11.87\nTax effect of key items (a)\n(0.38\n)\n(0.18\n)\n(0.58\n)\nKey items, after tax\n1.33\n0.74\n11.29\nTax specific key items:\nUncertain tax positions\n(0.15\n)\n(0.87\n)\n0.05\nRestructuring and separation activity\n0.06\n(0.21\n)\n-\nValuation allowance\n(0.07\n)\n-\n-\nOther tax reform related activity\n-\n0.10\n(0.33\n)\nTax specific key items (b)\n(0.16\n)\n(0.98\n)\n(0.28\n)\nTotal key items\n1.17\n(0.24\n)\n11.01\nAdjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (non-GAAP)\n$\n4.37\n$\n2.58\n$\n1.85\nAmortization expense adjustment (net of tax) (c)\n1.33\n1.17\n1.08\nAdjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (non-GAAP)\nexcluding intangibles amortization expense\n$\n5.70\n$\n3.75\n$\n2.93\n(a)Represents the diluted EPS impact from the tax effect of the key items that are previously identified above.\n(b)Represents the diluted EPS impact from tax specific financial transactions, tax law changes or other matters that fall within the definition of tax specific key items.

Unallocated and Other includes corporate governance activities and certain legacy matters. The historical segment information has been recast to conform to the current segment structure.\nResults of Ashlands reportable segments are presented based on its management and internal accounting structure. The structure is specific to Ashland; therefore, the financial results of Ashlands reportable segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other companies. Ashland allocates all significant costs to its reportable segments except for certain significant company-wide restructuring activities, certain corporate governance costs and other costs or activities that relate to former businesses that Ashland no longer operates. The service cost component of pension and other postretirement benefits costs is allocated to each reportable segment on a ratable basis; while the remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits costs are recorded within the other net periodic benefit income (loss) caption on the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). Ashland refines its expense allocation methodologies to the reportable segments from time to time as internal accounting practices are improved, more refined information becomes available and the industry or market changes.

Each of these non-GAAP measures is defined as follows: EBITDA (operating income plus depreciation and amortization), Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA adjusted for key items as applicable), and Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by sales). Ashland does not allocate items to each reportable segment below operating income, such as interest expense and income taxes. As a result, reportable segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are reconciled directly to operating income since it is the most directly comparable Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) caption.\nThe following EBITDA presentation for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, is provided as a means to enhance the understanding of financial measurements that Ashland has internally determined to be relevant measures of comparison for the results of Life Sciences.\nThe key items during year ended September 30, 2021 related to environmental reserve adjustments of $1 million.\nM-18\nThe key items during year ended September 30, 2020 related to inventory control measures of $11 million and restructuring costs of $1 million.\nLife Sciences\n(In millions)\nOperating income\n$\n$\n$\nDepreciation and amortization\nEBITDA\nRestructuring and other costs\n-\n-\nEnvironmental reserve adjustments\n-\n-\nInventory control measures\n-\n-\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n$\n$\nPersonal Care\nPersonal Care is comprised of biofunctionals, microbial protectants (preservatives), skin care, sun care, oral care, hair care and household solutions.

In certain circumstances, if such amounts were repatriated to the United States, additional taxes might need to be accrued and paid depending on the source of the earnings remitted. Ashland currently has no plans to repatriate any amounts for which additional taxes would need to be accrued. However, due to the Tax Act enacted in 2018, Ashland may reassess this position as it pertains to future earnings.\nAshland has taken actions and may continue to take actions intended to increase its cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of current uncertainty in global markets. During July 2022, Ashland enacted an amendment to the 2020 credit agreement. The amended credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement) provides for a $600 million five-year revolving credit facility (the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility). Proceeds of borrowings under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility are intended to provide ongoing working capital and for other general corporate purposes. During 2022, Ashland prepaid its Term loan A principal balance of $250 million and repaid the existing balance on its European short-term loan facility for $23 million. As of September 30, 2022, Ashland has total remaining borrowing capacity of $680 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility and foreign Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility. Ashland had zero available liquidity under the U.S. Accounts Receivable Sales Program as of September 30, 2022. Ashland has no maturities related to revolving credit facilities or bonds until fiscal 2027. See Note I for more information.\nAshland believes that cash flow from operations, availability under existing credit facilities and arrangements, current cash and investment balances and the ability to obtain other financing, if necessary, will provide adequate cash funds for Ashlands foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures at existing facilities, dividend payments and debt service obligations. Ashlands cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that the Company may complete may also impact its cash requirements.\nAshlands cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows, are summarized as follows.\n(In millions)\nCash provided (used) by:\nOperating activities from continuing operations\n$\n$\n$\nInvesting activities from continuing operations\n(102\n)\n(367\n)\n(85\n)\nFinancing activities from continuing operations\n(896\n)\n(426\n)\nDiscontinued operations\n1,252\nEffect of currency exchange rate changes on cash and\ncash equivalents\n(11\n)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n$\n(244\n)\n$\nAshland paid income taxes of $406 million, of which $339 million related to discontinued operations, during 2022 compared to $1 million in 2021 and $91 million in 2020.

The increase in working capital was the primary reason of the $224 million decline in ongoing free cash flow between periods primarily as a result of increased inventories to navigate supply-chain issues as well as cost inflation and increased accounts receivable as a result of higher sales volumes. Higher cash tax payments of $39 million also negatively impacted ongoing free cash flow between periods. Liquid assets (cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable) amounted to 190% and 65% of current liabilities (excluding current liabilities held for sale) as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively.\nThe following summary reflects Ashlands cash, investment securities and unused borrowing capacity as of September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nSeptember 30\n(In millions)\nCash and investment securities\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n$\n$\nRestricted investments (a)\nUnused borrowing capacity\nRevolving credit facility\n$\n$\n$\n2018 accounts receivable securitization (foreign)\n-\n-\nAccounts receivable sales program (U.S.)\n-\n-\n(a)\tIncludes $245 million, $333 million and $331 million related to the Asbestos trust and $129 million, $88 million and zero related to the Environmental trust as of September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 respectively.\nThe borrowing capacity remaining under the $600 million revolving credit facility was $581 million due to an outstanding balance of zero, as well as a reduction of $19 million for letters of credit outstanding at September 30, 2022. In total, Ashlands available liquidity position, which includes cash, the revolving credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization facilities, was $1,326 million at September 30, 2022 as compared to $566 million at September 30, 2021 and $954 million at September 30, 2020. Ashland had zero liquidity available under the U.S. Accounts Receivable Sales Program as of September 30, 2022 compared to $12 million as of September 30, 2021.

Proceeds of borrowings under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility are intended to provide ongoing working capital and for other general corporate purposes. During fiscal 2021, Ashland completed the issuance of 3.375% senior unsecured notes due 2031 with an aggregate principal amount of $450 million. Ashland used the net proceeds of the offering to redeem its obligations under the existing 4.750% senior notes due 2022 for a total of $411 million.\nDebt as a percent of capital employed was 28% at September 30, 2022 and 42% at September 30, 2021. At September 30, 2022, Ashlands total debt had an outstanding principal balance of $1,321 million, discounts of $37 million and debt issuance costs of $14 million. Ashland had no long-term debt (excluding debt issuance costs) maturing within the next 4 years and $4 million due in fiscal 2027.\nM-28\nCredit Agreements and Refinancing\nNote Issuances\nDuring August 2021, Ashland, through one of its subsidiaries, completed the issuance of 3.375% senior unsecured notes due 2031 with an aggregate principal amount of $450 million (the 2031 Notes). The notes are guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Ashland. Ashland used the net proceeds of the offering (after deducting initial purchasers' discounts and other fees and expenses) to redeem its obligations under the existing 4.750% senior notes due 2022 described below in debt repayments, and to pay fees and expenses associated therewith.\nAshland incurred $6 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the 2031 Notes, which is amortized using the effective interest method over the 2031 Notes' term and was included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nDuring January 2020, a subsidiary of Ashland, Ashland Services B.V., completed the issuance of 2.00% senior unsecured notes due 2028 with an aggregate principal amount of \u20ac500 million (the 2028 Notes). The notes are senior unsecured obligations of Ashland Services B.V and are guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Ashland.\nAshland incurred $8 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the 2028 Notes, which is amortized using the effective interest method over the 2028 Notes term.\n2020 Credit Agreement\nDuring January 2020, Ashland, through two of its subsidiaries, entered into a new senior unsecured credit agreement (the 2020 Credit Agreement) with a group of lenders, replacing the 2017 Credit Agreement. The 2020 Credit Agreement provided for (i) a $600 million unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility) and (ii) a $250 million unsecured five-year term loan facility (the 2020 Term Loan Facility). Proceeds of borrowings under the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility were used to refinance the Ashlands existing 2017 Credit Agreement, to provide ongoing working capital and for other general corporate purposes.\nAshland incurred $4 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the 2020 Credit Agreement, of which $1 million was expensed immediately during 2020 within the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). The remaining balance is amortized using the straight-line method.\nDuring July 2022, Ashland, through two of its subsidiaries, enacted an amendment to the 2020 credit agreement. The amended credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement) provides for a $600 million five-year revolving credit facility (the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility). The 2022 Credit Agreement and the obligations of Ashland Services B.V. under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by Ashland.\nAt Ashlands option, loans issued under the 2022 Credit Agreement will bear interest at (a) in the case of loans denominated in U.S. dollars, either Term SOFR or an alternate base rate and (b) in the case of loans denominated in Euros, EURIBOR, in each case plus the applicable interest rate margin. Loans will initially bear interest at Term SOFR or EURIBOR plus 1.250% per annum, in the case of Term SOFR borrowings or EURIBOR borrowings, respectively, or at the alternate base rate plus 0.250% per annum, in the case of alternate base rate borrowings, through and including the date of delivery of a quarterly compliance certificate and thereafter the interest rate will fluctuate between Term SOFR or EURIBOR plus 1.250% per annum and Term SOFR or EURIBOR plus 1.750% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 0.250% per annum and the alternate base rate plus 0.750% per annum), based upon the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) at such time. Term SOFR borrowings are subject to a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% per annum. In addition, the Company will initially be required to pay fees of 0.125% per annum on the daily unused amount of the Revolving Facility through and including the date of delivery of a quarterly compliance certificate, and thereafter the fee rate will fluctuate between 0.125% and 0.275% per annum, based upon the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio. Borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement may be prepaid at any time without premiums.\nAs a result of the amendment of the 2020 Credit Agreement, Ashland recognized a $1 million charge for accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2022, which is included in the net interest and other expense\nM-29\ncaption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). Ashland also incurred $2 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the 2022 Credit Agreement, of which $1 million was expensed immediately during 2022 within the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). The remaining balance is amortized using the straight-line method.\nThe 2022 Credit Agreement contains financial covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios akin to those in effect under the 2020 Credit Agreement. The 2022 Credit Agreement contains usual and customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios, limitations on liens, additional indebtedness, further negative pledges, investments, mergers, sale of assets and restricted payments, and other customary limitations.\nDebt repayments and repurchases\nCash repatriation\nDuring 2022 and 2021, Ashland repatriated approximately $250 million and $131 million, respectively, in cash that was primarily used to repay existing debt, principally portions of the 4.75% senior notes due 2022, the 6.875% senior notes due 2043 and the 6.5% junior notes in 2020 (as previously discussed).\n2022 Debt repayments and repurchases\n2020 Credit Agreement\nDuring 2022, Ashland prepaid its Term loan A principal balance of $250 million.\nOther Debt\nDuring 2022, Ashland repaid the outstanding balance on its European short-term loan facility for $23 million.\n2021 Debt repayments and repurchases\nRedemption of 4.750% senior notes due 2022\nDuring 2021, Ashland redeemed all of its outstanding 4.750% senior notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes), of which approximately $411 million were outstanding. Ashland recognized a $1 million charge related to accelerated accretion on debt discounts and accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs, which is included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nTotal premiums paid for all the tender offers in 2021 noted above were $16 million, which is included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n2020 Debt repayments and repurchases\nTender offers of 4.750% senior notes due 2022\nDuring 2020, Ashland executed tender offers of the 2022 Notes. As a result of these repurchases, the carrying values of the 2022 Notes was reduced by $670 million. Ashland recognized a $5 million charge related to accelerated accretion on debt discounts and accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs, which is included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nTender offers of 6.875% notes due 2043\nDuring 2020, Ashland executed tender offers of its 6.875% notes due 2043 (the 2043 Notes). As a result of these repurchases, the carrying values of the 2043 Notes was reduced by $92 million. Ashland recognized a $1 million charge related to accelerated accretion on debt premiums and accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs, which is included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nTender offers of 6.500% Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2029\nM-30\nDuring 2020, Ashland executed tender offers of Hercules LLCs 6.500% junior subordinated debentures due 2029 (the 2029 Junior Debentures). As a result of these repurchases, the carrying values of the 2029 Junior Debentures was reduced by $2 million.\nTotal premiums paid for all the tender offers in 2020 noted above were $59 million, which is included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nAccounts receivable facilities and off-balance sheet arrangements\nU.S. accounts receivable sales program\nOn March 17, 2021, a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity and consolidated Ashland subsidiary (SPE) entered into an agreement with a group of entities (buyers) to sell certain trade receivables, without recourse beyond the pledged receivables, of two other U.S. based Ashland subsidiaries. Under the agreement, Ashland can transfer whole receivables up to a limit established by the buyer, which is currently set at $125 million between February and October of each year and up to $100 million all other times. Ashlands continuing involvement is limited to servicing the receivables, including billing, collections and remittance of payments to the buyers as well as a limited guarantee on over-collateralization. The arrangement terminates on May 31, 2023, unless terminated earlier pursuant to the terms of the agreement.\nAshland determined that any receivables transferred under this agreement are put presumptively beyond the reach of Ashland and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. Ashland received a true sale at law and non-consolidation opinions to support the legal isolation of these receivables. Ashland accounts for the receivables transferred to buyers as sales. Ashland recognizes any gains or losses based on the excess of proceeds received net of buyers discounts and fees compared to the carrying value of the assets. Proceeds received, net of buyers discounts and fees, are recorded within the operating activities of the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. Losses on sale of assets, including related transaction expenses are recorded within the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). Ashland regularly assesses its servicing obligations and records them as assets or liabilities when appropriate. Ashland also monitors its obligation with regards to the limited guarantee and records the resulting guarantee liability when warranted. When applicable, Ashland discloses the amount of the receivable that serves as over-collateralization as a restricted asset.\nAshland recognized a $1 million loss within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for 2022 and 2021, respectively, within the net interest and other expense caption associated with sales under the program. Ashland has recorded $110 million of sales against the buyers limit, which was $125 million at September 30, 2022, compared to $113 million of sales against the buyer's limit, which was $125 million at September 30, 2021. Ashland transferred $136 million and $167 million in receivables to the SPE as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Ashland recorded liabilities related to its service obligations and limited guarantee as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 of less than $1 million. As of September 30, 2022, the year-to-date gross cash proceeds received for receivables transferred and derecognized was $312 million, of which $315 million was collected by Ashland in our capacity as a servicer of the receivables and remitted to the buyer. The difference of $3 million represents the impact of a net reduction in account receivable sales volume during the current year.\n2018 foreign accounts receivable securitization\nDuring July 2018, Ashland entered into a \u20ac115 million accounts receivable securitization facility (the Program) for the transfer by certain subsidiaries of Ashland (the Sellers) directly or indirectly to Ester Finance Titrisation (the Purchaser), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (the Arranger), of certain receivables and/or collections originated by the Sellers towards certain corporate debtors located in multiple European jurisdictions and denominated in multiple currencies. The Program originally had a term of two years, but was extended to August 2021 in September 2019. During July 2021, the termination date of the Program was extended to July 2023. During July 2020, the available funding for qualified receivables under the accounts receivable securitization facility decreased from \u20ac115 million to \u20ac100 million.\nUnder the Program, each Seller will assign, on an ongoing basis, certain of its accounts receivable and the right to the collections on those accounts receivable to the Purchaser. Under the terms of the Program, the Sellers could, from time to time, obtain up to \u20ac100 million from the Purchaser through the sale of an undivided interest in such accounts receivable and collections. Ashland accounts for the securitization facility as secured borrowings, and the receivables sold pursuant to the facility are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts receivable. Fundings under the Program will be repaid as accounts\nM-31\nreceivable are collected, with new fundings being advanced (through daily advanced purchase price) as new accounts receivable are originated by the Sellers and assigned to the Purchaser, with settlement occurring monthly. Ashland classifies any borrowings under this facility as a short-term debt instrument within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Once sold to the Purchaser, the accounts receivable and rights to collection described above are separate and distinct from each Sellers own assets and are not available to its creditors should such Sellers become insolvent.\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, the outstanding amount of accounts receivable transferred by Ashland to the Purchaser was $162 million and $152 million, respectively, and there were zero and $117 million, respectively, of borrowings (denominated in multiple currencies) under the facility. The weighted-average interest rate for this instrument was 0.5% and 0.6% for 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOther debt\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, Ashland held other debt totaling $63 million and $83 million, respectively, comprised primarily of a European short-term loan facility, the 6.50% notes due 2029 and other notes.\nAvailable borrowing capacity and liquidity\nThe borrowing capacity remaining under the $600 million 2022 Revolving Credit Facility was $581 million due to an outstanding balance of zero, as well as a reduction of $19 million for letters of credit outstanding at September 30, 2022. Ashland's total borrowing capacity at September 30, 2022 was $680 million, which included $99 million of available capacity from the foreign 2018 accounts receivable securitization facility.\nAdditionally, Ashland has zero available liquidity under its current U.S. Accounts Receivable Sales Program.\nCovenants related to current Ashland debt agreements\nAshlands debt contains usual and customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios, limitations on liens, additional subsidiary indebtedness, restrictions on subsidiary distributions, investments, mergers, sale of assets and restricted payments and other customary limitations. As of September 30, 2022, Ashland was in compliance with all debt agreement covenant restrictions.\nThe maximum consolidated net leverage ratio permitted under Ashlands most recent credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement) is 4.0. The 2022 Credit Agreement defines the consolidated net leverage ratio as the ratio of consolidated indebtedness minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to consolidated EBITDA (Covenant Adjusted EBITDA) for any measurement period. In general, the 2022 Credit Agreement defines Covenant Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus consolidated interest charges, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, fees and expenses related to capital market transactions and proposed or actual acquisitions and divestitures, restructuring and integration charges, certain environmental charges, non-cash stock and equity compensation expense, and any other nonrecurring expenses or losses that do not represent a cash item in such period or any future period; less any non-cash gains or other items increasing net income. The computation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA differs from the calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which have been reconciled on page M-14. In general, consolidated indebtedness includes debt plus all purchase money indebtedness, bankers acceptances and bank guaranties, deferred purchase price of property or services, attributable indebtedness and guarantees. At September 30, 2022, Ashlands calculation of the consolidated net leverage ratio was 1.1.\nThe minimum required consolidated interest coverage ratio under the 2022 Credit Agreement is 3.0. The 2022 Credit Agreement defines the consolidated interest coverage ratio as the ratio of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest charges for any measurement period. At September 30, 2022, Ashlands calculation of the consolidated interest coverage ratio was 10.8.\nAny change in Covenant Adjusted EBITDA of $100 million would have an approximate 0.2x effect on the consolidated net leverage ratio and a 1.8x effect on the consolidated interest coverage ratio. Any change in consolidated indebtedness of $100 million would affect the consolidated net leverage ratio by approximately 0.2x.\nM-32\nAshland credit ratings\nAshlands corporate credit ratings remained unchanged at BB+ by Standard & Poors and Ba1 by Moodys Investor Services. As of September 30, 2022, both Moodys Investor Services and Standard & Poors outlook remained at stable. Subsequent changes to these ratings or outlook may have an effect on Ashlands borrowing rate or ability to access capital markets in the future.\nAdditional capital resources\nAshland cash projection\nAshland believes that cash flow from operations, availability under existing credit facilities and arrangements, current cash and investment balances and the ability to obtain other financing, if necessary, will provide adequate cash funds for the Companys foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures at existing facilities, pending acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations. The Companys cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that the Company may complete may also impact its cash requirements.\nM-33\nAshland expects the following material cash funding requirements from known contractual obligations at September 30, 2022:\nLess than\nMore than\n(In millions)\nTotal\n1 year\n1 year\nMaterial Cash Funding Requirements Contractual obligations\nRaw material and service contract purchase obligations (a)\n$\n$\n$\nEmployee benefit obligations (b)\nOperating lease obligations (c)\nInterest payments (d)\nUnrecognized tax benefits (e)\nOne-time transition tax (f)\nTotal contractual obligations\n$\n1,036\n$\n$\nOther commitments\nLetters of credit (g)\n$\n$\n$\n-\n(a)Includes raw material and service contracts where minimal committed quantities and prices are fixed.\n(b)Includes estimated funding of Ashlands qualified U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans for 2022 as well as projected benefit payments through 2030 under Ashlands unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Excludes the benefit payments from the pension plan trust funds. See Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n(c)Includes leases for office buildings, transportation equipment, warehouses and storage facilities and other equipment. For further information, see Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(d)Includes interest expense on both variable and fixed rate debt assuming no prepayments. Variable interest rates have been assumed to remain constant through the end of the term at rates that existed as of September 30, 2022.\n(e)Due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with respect to taxing authorities, Ashland is unable to determine the timing of payments related to noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties. Therefore, these amounts were included in the More than 1 year column.\n(f)As a result of the Tax Act enacted during fiscal year 2018, Ashland has currently recorded a $46 million liability for the one-time transition tax. This liability will be payable over five years.\n(g)Ashland issues various types of letters of credit as part of its normal course of business.\nTotal Equity\nTotal equity was $3,220 million and $2,752 million at September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. During 2022, there were increases of $927 million for net income, $8 million for common shares issued under stock incentive plans, and a $1 million gain on pension and postretirement obligation adjustments. The increases were partially offset by decreases of $197 million for deferred translation losses, $1 million for unrealized losses on commodity hedges, $200 million for repurchases of common stock and $70 million for dividends paid during 2022.\nStock repurchase programs\nOn May 25, 2022, Ashland's board of directors authorized a new, evergreen $500 million common share repurchase program (2022 stock repurchase program). The new authorization terminates and replaces the company's 2018 $1 billion share repurchase program, which had $150 million outstanding at the date of termination. As of September 30, 2022, $500 million remained available for repurchase under the 2022 stock repurchase program.\nStock repurchase program agreements\nIn September 2021, under the 2018 stock repurchase program, Ashland announced that it entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (2021 ASR Agreement). Under the 2021 ASR Agreement, Ashland paid an initial purchase price of $450 million and received an initial delivery of 3.9 million shares of common stock during September 2021. The bank exercised its early termination option under the 2021 ASR Agreement in February 2022, and an additional 0.7 million shares were repurchased, bringing the total shares repurchased upon settlement to 4.6 million.\nOn March 1, 2022, under the 2018 stock repurchase program, Ashland entered into an agreement to repurchase an aggregate amount of $200 million of Ashland common stock using open-market purchases under rule 10b-18. On April 8, 2022, Ashland completed repurchases under this agreement repurchasing a total of 2.15 million shares for a total amount of $200 million.\nM-34\nStockholder dividends\nAshland paid dividends per common share of $1.27, $1.15 and $1.10 during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nIn May 2022, the Board of Directors of Ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend of 33.5 cents per share to eligible stockholders at record, which represented an increase from the previous quarterly cash dividend of 30.0 cents per share. This dividend was paid in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022.\nIn May 2021, the Board of Directors of Ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend of 30.0 cents per share to eligible stockholders at record, which represented an increase from the previous quarterly cash dividend of 27.5 cents per share. This dividend was paid in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021 and the first and second quarters of fiscal 2022.\nIn May 2019, the Board of Directors of Ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend of 27.5 cents per share to eligible stockholders at record, which represented an increase from the previous quarterly cash dividend of 25.0 cents per share. This dividend was paid in each quarter of fiscal 2020 and the first and second quarters of fiscal 2021.\nCapital expenditures\nCapital expenditures were $113 million for 2022 and averaged $117 million during the last three years. Ashland expects capital expenditures over the next three years of approximately $190 million in 2023 and $165 million annually the next two years. A summary of capital expenditures by reportable segment during 2022, 2021 and 2020 follow.\n(In millions)\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\n$\nPersonal Care\nSpecialty Additives\nIntermediates\nUnallocated and Other\nTotal capital expenditures\n$\n$\n$\nA summary of the capital employed in Ashlands current operations, which is calculated by adding equity to capital investment, as of the end of the last two years is as follows.\n(In millions)\nCapital employed (a)\nLife Sciences\n$\n1,801\n$\n1,857\nPersonal Care\n1,082\nSpecialty Additives\n1,379\n1,447\nIntermediates\n(a)Excludes the assets and liabilities classified within unallocated and other which primarily includes debt and other long-term liabilities such as asbestos and pension. The net liability in unallocated and other was $1,092 million and $2,313 million as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, net assets held for sale were zero million and $547 million as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs part of its normal course of business, Ashland is a party to various financial guarantees and other commitments. These arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk that are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility that Ashland would have to make actual cash expenditures in connection with these obligations is largely dependent on the performance of the guaranteed party, or the occurrence of future events that Ashland is unable to predict. The fair value of these guarantees are not significant.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor a discussion and analysis of recently issued accounting pronouncements and its impact on Ashland, see Note A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nM-35\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of Ashlands Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, environmental remediation, asbestos litigation, the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management has reviewed the estimates affecting these items with the Audit Committee of Ashlands Board of Directors.\nEnvironmental remediation and asset retirement obligations\nAshland is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts (collectively environmental remediation) at multiple locations. At September 30, 2022, such locations included 76 sites where Ashland has been identified as a potentially responsible party under Superfund or similar state laws, 111 current and former operating facilities and about 1,125 service station properties, of which 17 are being actively remediated. See Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAshlands reserves for environmental remediation and related environmental litigation amounted to $211 million at September 30, 2022 compared to $207 million at September 30, 2021 of which $157 million at September 30, 2022 and $152 million at September 30, 2021 were classified in other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining reserves were classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe total reserves for environmental remediation reflect Ashlands estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable, without regard to any third-party recoveries. Engineering studies, historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation. Ashland continues to discount certain environmental sites and regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues. Ashland has estimated the value of its probable insurance recoveries associated with its environmental reserve based on managements interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, Ashlands recorded receivable for these probable insurance recoveries was $21 million and $16 million, respectively, of which $17 million and $13 million, respectively, were classified in other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, Ashland recognized $66 million, $50 million and $48 million of expense, respectively, for certain environmental liabilities related to normal ongoing remediation cost estimate updates for sites, which is consistent with Ashlands historical environmental accounting policy.\nEnvironmental remediation reserves are subject to uncertainties that affect Ashlands ability to estimate its share of the costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site and the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, with varying costs of alternate cleanup methods. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of environmental remediation, Ashland currently estimates that the upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for identified sites could be as high as approximately $465 million. The largest reserve for any site is 13% of the remediation reserve.\nAsbestos litigation\nAshland and Hercules have liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. To assist in developing and annually updating independent reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs, Ashland has retained third party actuarial experts Gnarus Advisors, LLC (Gnarus). The methodology used by Gnarus to project future asbestos costs is based largely on recent experience, including claim-filing and settlement rates, disease mix, open claims and litigation defense. The claim experience of Ashland and Hercules are separately compared to the results of previously conducted third party epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases. Those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population expected to have been exposed to asbestos. Using that\nM-36\ninformation, Gnarus estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed, as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims. Changes in asbestos-related liabilities and receivables are recorded on an after-tax basis within the discontinued operations caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). See Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAshland asbestos-related litigation\nThe claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos asserted against Ashland result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in 1990 in connection with the sale of Riley, a former subsidiary. The amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate from period to period.\nAshland asbestos-related liability\nFrom the range of estimates, Ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs. Ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non-inflated, non-discounted approximate 40-year model developed with the assistance of Gnarus.\nDuring the most recent update completed during 2022, it was determined that the liability for Ashland asbestos-related claims should be increased by $16 million. Total reserves for asbestos claims were $305 million at September 30, 2022 compared to $320 million at September 30, 2021.\nAshland asbestos-related receivables\nAshland has insurance coverage for certain litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in connection with its asbestos claims, and coverage-in-place agreements exist with the insurance companies that provide substantially all of the coverage that will be accessed.\nFor the Ashland asbestos-related obligations, Ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on managements interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage, including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent. Substantially all of the estimated receivables from insurance companies are expected to be due from domestic insurers, all of which are solvent.\nAt September 30, 2022, Ashlands receivable for recoveries of litigation defense and claim settlement costs from insurers amounted to $101 million (excluding the Hercules receivable for asbestos claims). Receivables from insurers amounted to $100 million at September 30, 2021. During 2022, the annual update of the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers, was completed. This model update resulted in a $7 million increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries.\nHercules asbestos-related litigation\nHercules has liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Such claims typically arise from alleged exposure to asbestos fibers from resin encapsulated pipe and tank products which were sold by one of Hercules former subsidiaries to a limited industrial market. The amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate from period to period.\nHercules asbestos-related liability\nFrom the range of estimates, Ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs. Ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non-inflated, non-discounted approximate 40-year model developed with the assistance of Gnarus. As a result of the most recent annual update of this estimate, completed during 2022, it was determined that the liability for Hercules asbestos-related claims should be increased by $15 million. Total reserves for asbestos claims were $213 million at September 30, 2022 compared to $217 million at September 30, 2021.\nHercules asbestos-related receivables\nFor the Hercules asbestos-related obligations, certain reimbursement obligations pursuant to coverage-in-place agreements with insurance carriers exist. As a result, any increases in the asbestos reserve have been partially offset by probable insurance\nM-37\nrecoveries. Ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on managements interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage, including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent. The estimated receivable consists exclusively of solvent domestic insurers.\nAs of September 30, 2022 the receivables from insurers amounted to $52 million compared to $47 million as of September 30, 2021. During 2022, the annual update of the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers was completed. This model update resulted in a $7 million increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries.\nAsbestos litigation cost projection\nProjecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are difficult to predict. In addition to the uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received, other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant and the related costs incurred in resolving those claims, dismissal rates, uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case. Furthermore, any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. In light of these inherent uncertainties, Ashland believes that the asbestos reserves for Ashland and Hercules represent the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes. As a part of the process to develop these estimates of future asbestos costs, a range of long-term cost models was developed. These models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long-term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs, as well as other variables mentioned previously. Ashland has currently estimated in various models ranging from approximately 40 year periods that it is reasonably possible that total future litigation defense and claim settlement costs on an inflated and undiscounted basis could range as high as approximately $456 million for the Ashland asbestos-related litigation (current reserve of $305 million) and approximately $317 million for the Hercules asbestos-related litigation (current reserve of $213 million), depending on the combination of assumptions selected in the various models. If actual experience is worse than projected, relative to the number of claims filed, the severity of alleged disease associated with those claims or costs incurred to resolve those claims, or actuarial refinement or improvements to the assumptions used within these models are initiated, Ashland may need to further increase the estimates of the costs associated with asbestos claims and these increases could be material over time.\nAccounting for goodwill and other intangible assets\nGoodwill\nAshland accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance which does not allow for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets to be amortized.\nAshland reviews goodwill for impairment annually as of July 1 or when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. Ashland tests goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting units to the related carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. However, the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Reporting units are defined as either operating segments or one level below the operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by the business management. Ashland determined that its reporting units are Life Sciences, Personal Care, Specialty Additives and Intermediates.\nAshland makes various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow models and valuations based on earnings multiples for guideline public companies in each reporting units industry peer group, when externally quoted market prices are not readily available. Discounted cash flow models are reliant on various assumptions, including projected business results, long-term growth factors and weighted-average cost of capital. Management judgement is involved in estimating these variables, and they include uncertainties since they are forecasting future events. Ashland performs sensitivity analyses by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of the long-term growth rate and weighted average cost of capital estimates. Additionally, Ashland compares the indicated equity value to Ashlands market capitalization and evaluates the resulting implied control premium/discount to determine if the estimated enterprise value is reasonable compared to external market indicators.\nM-38\nAshland performed its annual goodwill impairment using the quantitative approach as of July 1, 2022 and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. The impairment test at July 1, 2022 concluded that all reporting units had fair values significantly in excess of its respective carrying amounts. Ashland compared the total fair values of the reporting units to Ashlands market capitalization at July 1, 2022 to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators. Ashland believes its valuation models are reasonable estimates of fair value and reflect appropriate levels of conservatism. Subsequent to this annual impairment test, no additional indications of an impairment were identified.\nAssumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies include estimates of future projected business results (principally revenue and EBITDA), long-term growth rates, and the weighted-average cost of capital. Ashland performed sensitivity analyses by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of long-term growth rate and weighted average cost of capital estimates. Significant assumptions utilized in the impairment analysis included the weighted-average cost of capital, ranging between 10.5% and 11.8%, and terminal growth rate, ranging between 2.0% and 4.0% depending on the reporting unit. Based on sensitivity analysis performed on two key assumptions in the discounted cash flow model at July 1, 2022, a 1% decrease in the long-term growth factor assumption or a 1% increase in the weighted average cost of capital assumption across each of Ashlands reporting units would not have resulted in a fair value below the respective reporting units carrying value. For further information, see Note H of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinite-lived intangible assets\nFinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of certain trademarks and trade names, intellectual property, and customer relationships. These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The cost of trademarks and trade names is amortized principally over 3 to 20 years, intellectual property over 3 to 20 years and customer and supplier relationships over 10 to 24 years. Ashland reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Ashland monitors these changes and events on at least a quarterly basis.\nAmortization expense recognized on finite-lived intangible assets was $94 million for 2022, $90 million for 2021 and $84 million for 2020.\nOther indefinite-lived intangible assets\nOther indefinite-lived intangible assets include certain trademarks and trade names. Ashland reviews these intangible assets for possible impairment annually as of July 1 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an individual indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the asset is written down to its fair value and the amount of the write down is the impairment charge. Similar to its annual assessment for goodwill, Ashland performs a quantitative test for impairment.\nWhen a quantitative analysis is performed, Ashland tests these assets using a relief-from-royalty valuation method to determine the fair value. Significant assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, future projected business results, growth rates, the weighted-average cost of capital for a market participant, and royalty and discount rates.\nIn conjunction with the July 1 annual assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, Ashlands quantitative approach models did not indicate any impairment, as each indefinite-lived intangible assets fair value exceeded their carrying values.\nAshlands assessment of an impairment on any of these assets classified currently as having indefinite lives, including goodwill, could change in future periods if significant events happen and/or circumstances change that effect the previously mentioned assumptions. Significant assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, such estimates as future projected business results, growth rates, the weighted average cost of capital for a market participant, and royalty and discount rates. For further information, see Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nM-39\nIncome taxes\nAshland is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Judgment in the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results is required in determining Ashlands provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid, currently payable or receivable, and deferred taxes. Under U.S. GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax loss and credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the enactment date occurs. Valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested. In the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from Ashlands estimates and assumptions due to changes or future events such as tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material effect on the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and judgment by Ashland. If actual results differ from the estimates made by Ashland in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset. Additionally, the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities, which may result in future taxes, interest and penalties. Positive and negative evidence is considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which includes such evidence as historical earnings, projected future earnings, tax planning strategies and expected timing of reversal of existing temporary differences.\nIn determining the recoverability of deferred tax assets Ashland gives consideration to all available positive and negative evidence including reversals of deferred tax liabilities (other than those with an indefinite reversal period), projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. Ashland attaches the most weight to historical earnings due to their verifiable nature. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, Ashland considers three years of cumulative income or loss. In addition, Ashland has reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.\nEFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES\nAshlands financial statements are prepared on the historical cost method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP and, as a result, do not reflect changes in the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar. Monetary assets (such as cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable) lose purchasing power as a result of inflation, while monetary liabilities (such as accounts payable and indebtedness) result in a gain, because they can be settled with dollars of diminished purchasing power. As of September 30, 2022, Ashlands monetary assets exceed its monetary liabilities, leaving it currently more exposed to the effects of future inflation. While inflation rose significantly during 2022 and is expected to increase through fiscal 2023, the company managed to reduce its impact on its results of operations and financial liquidity through the use of select derivative programs, disciplined pricing and cost actions. See item 1A - Risk Factors for additional information.\nCertain of the industries in which Ashland operates are capital-intensive, and replacement costs for its plant and equipment generally would substantially exceed their historical costs. Accordingly, depreciation and amortization expense would be greater if it were based on current replacement costs. However, because replacement facilities would reflect technological improvements and changes in business strategies, such facilities would be expected to be more productive than existing facilities, mitigating at least part of the increased expense.\nM-40\nOUTLOOK\nAshland issued its financial outlook for fiscal 2023 as shown in the table below.\nFY2023 Outlook\nKey Operating Metrics\nSales\n$2.5 - $2.7 billion\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$600 - $650 million\nAshland is unable to reconcile forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to forward-looking net income, the most closely comparable GAAP financial measure, because the information needed to provide such reconciliation would require unreasonable efforts.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements made under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation (MD&A), within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Ashland has identified some of these forward-looking statements with words such as anticipates, believes, expects, estimates, is likely, predicts, projects, forecasts, objectives, may, will, should, plans and intends and the negative of these words or other comparable terminology. Ashland may from time to time make forward-looking statements in its Annual Report to Stockholders, quarterly reports and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), news releases and other written and oral communications. These forward-looking statements are based on Ashlands expectations and assumptions, as of the date such statements are made, regarding Ashlands future operating performance and financial condition and expected effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Ashlands business, as well as the economy and other future events or circumstances. Ashlands expectations and assumptions include, without limitation, those mentioned within the MD&A, internal forecasts and analyses of current and future market conditions and trends, management plans and strategies, operating efficiencies, cost savings and economic conditions (such as prices, supply and demand, cost of raw materials, and the ability to recover raw-material cost increases through price increases), and risks and uncertainties associated with the following: the impact of acquisitions and/or divestitures Ashland has made or may make (including the possibility that Ashland may not realize the anticipated benefits from such transactions); Ashlands substantial indebtedness (including the possibility that such indebtedness and related restrictive covenants may adversely affect Ashlands future cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and its ability to repay debt); execution risks associated with our growth strategies; the competitive nature of our business; severe weather, natural disasters, public health crises (including the COVID-19 pandemic), cyber events and legal proceedings and claims (including product recalls, environmental and asbestos matters); the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing Ukraine and Russia conflict on the geographies in which Ashland operates, the end markets Ashland serves and on Ashlands supply chain and customers; and without limitation, risks and uncertainties affecting Ashland that are contained in Use of estimates, risks and uncertainties in Note A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in Item 1A of this Annual Report Form 10-K. Various risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, projected or implied by any forward-looking statements. The extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations remains uncertain. Factors that influence the impact on our business and operations include the duration and extent of the pandemic, the extent of imposed or recommended containment and mitigation measures, and the general economic consequences of the pandemic. Ashland believes its expectations and assumptions are reasonable, but there can be no assurance that the expectations reflected herein will be achieved. Unless legally required, Ashland undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Information on Ashlands website is not incorporated into or a part of this Form 10-K.\nM-41 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAshland conducts business in a variety of foreign currencies. Accordingly, Ashland regularly uses foreign currency derivative instruments to manage exposure on certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies to curtail potential earnings volatility effects of certain assets and liabilities, including short-term inter-company loans, denominated in currencies other than Ashlands functional currency of an entity. These derivative contracts generally require exchange of one foreign currency for another at a fixed rate at a future date and generally have maturities of less than twelve months. All contracts are valued at fair value with net changes in fair value recorded within the selling, general and administrative expense caption. The impacts of these contracts were largely offset by gains and losses resulting from the impact of changes in exchange rates on transactions denominated in non-functional currencies.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, Ashland had not identified any significant credit risk on open derivative contracts. The potential loss from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates on Ashlands open foreign currency derivative instruments would be largely offset by gains resulting from the impact of changes in exchange rates on transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. Ashland did not have any significant open hedging contracts with respect to commodities or any related raw material requirements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nM-42 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nManagement's report on internal control over financial reporting\nReports of independent registered public accounting firm (Ernst & Young LLP; PCAOB ID: 42)\nConsolidated Financial Statements:\nStatements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nStatements of Consolidated Equity\nStatements of Consolidated Cash Flows\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nMANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Such financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Accounting principles are selected, and information is reported which, using managements best judgment and estimates, present fairly Ashlands consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The other financial information in this annual report on Form 10-K is consistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAshlands management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Ashlands internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Ashlands Consolidated Financial Statements. Ashlands internal control over financial reporting is supported by a code of business conduct which summarizes our guiding values such as obeying the law, adhering to high ethical standards and acting as responsible members of the communities where we operate. Compliance with that Code forms the foundation of our internal control systems, which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that Ashlands assets are safeguarded, and its records reflect, in all material respects, transactions in accordance with managements authorization. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition that the cost of a system of internal control should not exceed the related benefits. Management believes that adequate internal controls are maintained by the selection and training of qualified personnel, by an appropriate division of responsibility in all organizational arrangements, by the establishment and communication of accounting and business policies, and by internal audits.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Board, subject to stockholder ratification, selects and engages the independent auditors based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee, composed of directors who are not members of management, reviews the adequacy of Ashlands policies, procedures, controls and risk management strategies, the scope of auditing and other services performed by the independent auditors, and the scope of the internal audit function. The Committee holds meetings with Ashlands internal auditor and independent auditors, with and without management present, to discuss the findings of their audits, the overall quality of Ashlands financial reporting and their evaluation of Ashlands internal controls. The report of Ashlands Audit Committee can be found in Ashlands Proxy for its 2023 Annual Meeting.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of Ashlands internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. Management conducted its assessment utilizing the framework described in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management believes that Ashland maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022.\nErnst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited and reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Ashland Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022 and the effectiveness of Ashlands internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. The reports of the independent registered public accounting firm are contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n/s/ Guillermo Novo\nGuillermo Novo\nChair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n/s/ J. Kevin Willis\nJ. Kevin Willis\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nNovember 21, 2022\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Ashland Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Ashland Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Ashland Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated November 21, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nGrandview Heights, Ohio\nNovember 21, 2022\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Ashland Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ashland Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated November 21, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nValuation of Environmental Remediation Reserves\nDescription of the Matter\nAt September 30, 2022, the reserves for environmental remediation amounted to $211 million. As discussed within Note N of the consolidated financial statements, the reserves for environmental remediation reflect Ashlands estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable and probable of being incurred, without regard to any third-party recoveries. The Company uses engineering studies, historical experience and other factors to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation. Ashland regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues.\nAuditing the environmental remediation reserve was complex due to inherent uncertainties that affect Ashlands ability to estimate probable costs. Such uncertainties include the nature and extent of contamination at each site, and the nature and extent of required cleanup efforts.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant controls over Ashlands environmental remediation process. For example, we tested controls over the Companys annual reserve setting training process, managements identification and monitoring of new and existing sites, and managements development of the environmental reserve estimates. We also tested managements controls over the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the reserve estimates.\nTo test the environmental reserves, we performed audit procedures that included, among others: assessing the appropriateness of Ashlands policies and procedures and testing managements development of the environmental reserve estimates. We obtained an understanding of the reserve estimates through discussions with Ashlands remediation project managers. We also involved our environmental reserve subject matter specialists to evaluate the reasonableness of managements reserve estimates, including consideration of information available on regulatory databases in the public domain that was assessed for possible contrary evidence. With the support of our environmental reserve subject matter specialists, we evaluated whether the environmental reserve estimates were appropriate based on engineering studies and historical experience.\nValuation of Asbestos Litigation Reserves\nDescription of the Matter\nAt September 30, 2022, the reserves for asbestos litigation amounted to $518 million. As discussed within Note N of the consolidated financial statements, Ashland has liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Ashland retained third party actuarial experts to assist in developing and annually updating independent reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs given various assumptions. The methodology used by the actuarial experts to project future asbestos costs is based largely on recent experience, including claim-filing and settlement rates, disease mix, open claims and litigation defense. Further, the claim experience identified is compared to the results of previously conducted third party epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases. Using that information, the Company estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed, as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims. Ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs using the results of a non-inflated, non-discounted approximate 40-year model developed with the assistance of the Companys third party actuarial experts.\nAuditing the Companys asbestos litigation reserve is complex and highly judgmental due to uncertainty associated with the estimate of projected future asbestos costs. The methodology employed by management to develop the estimate of projected future asbestos costs is subject to assumptions such as the number of claims that may be received in the future, the type and severity of disease alleged by claimant, the related costs incurred in resolving those claims, and the dismissal rates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the asbestos litigation reserve.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the asbestos litigation reserves process. These include controls over management's assessment of the assumptions utilized within the estimate, managements oversight of asbestos trends including claims movement and costs incurred, and the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data utilized to project future costs.\nTo evaluate the reasonableness of the reserve for asbestos litigation, our audit procedures included testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying claims data provided to management's actuarial experts utilized to project future costs. Additionally, we evaluated the claims and spend activity from legal letters obtained from internal and external legal counsel. Furthermore, we involved our actuarial subject matter specialists to assist in the evaluation of the methodologies and assumptions applied by management's experts as described above to determine the appropriateness of the asbestos litigation reserve, and to independently prepare an estimated range of the liability. We then assessed the reasonableness of the Company's recorded reserve against our independently calculated range.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2014.\nGrandview Heights, Ohio\nNovember 21, 2022\nAshland Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries\nStatements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nYears Ended September 30\n(In millions except per share data)\nSales\n$\n2,391\n$\n2,111\n$\n2,016\nCost of sales\n1,561\n1,441\n1,417\nGross profit\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nResearch and development expense\nIntangibles amortization expense -

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Ashland Inc. (Ashland) (formerly Ashland Global Holdings Inc.) and its majority owned subsidiaries and, when applicable, entities for which Ashland has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. Investments in joint ventures and 20% to 50% owned affiliates where Ashland has the ability to exert significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Additionally, certain prior period data, primarily related to discontinued operations, have been reclassified in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes to conform to the current period presentation.\nAshland is comprised of the following reportable segments: Life Sciences, Personal Care, Specialty Additives and Intermediates. Unallocated and Other includes corporate governance activities and certain legacy matters. See Note R for more information.\nUse of estimates, risks and uncertainties\nThe preparation of Ashlands Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, environmental remediation, asbestos litigation, the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAshlands results are affected by domestic and international economic, political, legislative, regulatory and legal actions. Economic conditions, such as recessionary trends, inflation, interest and monetary exchange rates, government fiscal policies and changes in the prices of certain key raw materials, can have a significant effect on operations. While Ashland maintains reserves for anticipated liabilities and carries various levels of insurance, Ashland could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings relating to asbestos, environmental remediation or other matters.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments maturing within three months after purchase.\nAllowance for credit losses on accounts receivable\nEffective with the October 1, 2020 adoption of ASU 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\" (Topic 326), Ashland records an allowance for credit losses using the expected credit loss model. Ashland estimates expected credit losses based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. When measuring expected credit losses, Ashland pools assets with similar country risk and credit risk characteristics. Each period the allowance for credit losses is adjusted through earnings to reflect expected credit losses over the remaining lives of the assets.\nA progression of activity in the allowance for credit losses is presented in the following table.\n(In millions)\nAllowance for credit losses - beginning of year\n$\n$\n$\nAdjustments to allowances for credit losses\nReserves utilized\n(1\n)\n(1\n)\n(2\n)\nAllowance for credit losses - end of year\n$\n$\n$\nInventories\nInventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories are stated at cost using the weighted-average cost method. This method values inventories using average costs for raw materials and most recent production costs for labor and overhead.\nThe following summarizes Ashlands inventories as of the Consolidated Balance Sheet dates.\n(In millions)\nFinished products\n$\n$\nRaw materials, supplies and work in process\n$\n$\nA progression of activity in the inventory reserves, which reduce the amounts of finished products and raw materials, supplies and work in process reported, is presented in the following table.\n(In millions)\nInventory reserves - beginning of year\n$\n$\n$\nAdjustments to inventory reserves\nReserves utilized\n(3\n)\n(5\n)\n(6\n)\nInventory reserves - end of year\n$\n$\n$\nProperty, plant and equipment\nThe cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings are depreciated principally over 12 to 35 years and machinery and equipment principally over 2 to 25 years. Such costs are periodically reviewed for recoverability when impairment indicators are present. Such indicators include, among other factors, operating losses, unused capacity, market value declines and technological obsolescence. Recorded values of asset groups of property, plant and equipment that are not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows are written down to current fair value, which generally is determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows (assets held for use) or net realizable value (assets held for sale). See Note G for additional information related to property, plant and equipment.\nLeasing arrangements\nAshland determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception based on whether or not it has the right to control the asset during the contract period and other facts and circumstances.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets represent Ashlands right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent Ashlands obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease, both of which are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception are not recorded within the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). The lease term is determined by assuming the exercise of renewal options that are reasonably certain. As most leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, Ashland used its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. When contracts contain lease and non-lease components, Ashland generally accounts for both components as a single lease component.\nFor additional information, see Note K for additional information on leasing arrangements.\nGoodwill and other intangibles\nAshland tests goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of July 1 and when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. Ashland reviews goodwill for impairment based on its identified reporting units. Ashland determined that its reporting units are Life Sciences, Personal Care, Specialty Additives and Intermediates. Ashland tests goodwill for impairment by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value of its reporting units. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. However, the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\nUsing the quantitative approach, Ashland makes various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow models and valuations based on earnings multiples for guideline public companies in each reporting units industry peer group, when externally quoted market prices are not readily available. Discounted cash flow models are reliant on various assumptions, including projected business results, long-term growth factors and weighted-average cost of capital. Management judgement is involved in estimating these variables, and they include uncertainties since they are forecasting future events. Ashland performs sensitivity analyses by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of the long-term growth rate and weighted average cost of capital. Additionally, Ashland compares the indicated equity value to Ashlands market capitalization and evaluates the resulting implied control premium/discount to determine if the estimated enterprise value is reasonable compared to external market indicators.\nAshland tests at least annually its indefinite-lived intangible assets, principally trademarks and trade names. If the carrying value of an individual indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, such individual indefinite-lived intangible asset is written down by an amount equal to such excess. Ashland performs a quantitative impairment test for the trademarks and trade names during which, trademarks and trade names are valued using a relief-from-royalty valuation method compared to the carrying value. Assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, such estimates as future projected business results, growth rates, the weighted-average cost of capital for a market participant, and royalty and discount rates.\nFinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of certain trademarks and trade names, intellectual property, and customer lists. These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The cost of trademarks and trade names is amortized principally over 3 to 20 years, intellectual property over 3 to 20 years and customer and supplier relationships over 10 to 24 years. Ashland reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Ashland monitors these changes and events on at least a quarterly basis. The intangibles amortization expense caption within the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) includes amortization expense related to trademarks and trade names, intellectual property and customer and supplier relationships. Intangible assets classified as finite are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. For further information on goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note H.\nDerivative instruments\nAshland regularly uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies and certain commodities. All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and are measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Gains and losses related to an instrument that qualifies for hedge accounting are either recognized in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) immediately to offset the gain or loss on the hedged item, or deferred and recorded in the stockholders equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) when the hedged item affects net income. For additional information on derivative instruments, see Note F.\nRestricted investments\nOn January 13, 2015, Ashland and Hercules LLC (formerly Hercules Incorporated), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Ashland that was acquired in fiscal 2009, entered into a comprehensive settlement agreement related to certain insurance coverage for asbestos bodily injury claims with Underwriters at Lloyds, certain London companies and Chartis (AIG) member companies, along with National Indemnity Company and Resolute Management, Inc., under which Ashland and Hercules received a total of $398 million (the January 2015 asbestos insurance settlement). During 2015, Ashland placed $335 million of the settlement funds into a renewable annual trust for asbestos (Asbestos trust) that Ashland determined is restricted for the purpose of paying ongoing and future litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in conjunction with asbestos claims. These funds are presented primarily as noncurrent assets within the restricted investments caption of the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with $27 million classified within other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the funds within the Asbestos trust had a balance of $245 million and $333 million, respectively, and were primarily invested in public equity, U.S. government bonds and investment grade corporate bond investments with a portion maintained in demand deposits.\nOn September 8, 2021, Ashland established a renewable annual trust for environmental remediation (Environmental trust) that Ashland determined is restricted for ongoing and future environmental remediation and related litigation costs. These funds are presented primarily as noncurrent assets within the restricted investments caption of the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with $34 million and $10 million classified within other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the funds within the Environmental trust had a balance of $129 million and $88 million, respectively, and were primarily invested in public equity, U.S. government bonds and investment grade corporate bond investments with a portion maintained in demand deposits.\nThe funds within these trusts are classified as investment securities reported at fair value. Interest income and gains and losses on the investment securities are reported in the net interest and other expense caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). See Note F for additional information regarding the fair value of these investments within the trusts.\nRevenue recognition\nAshlands revenue is measured as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods and is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied under the terms of contracts or purchase orders with customers. Ashland generally utilizes standardized language for the terms of contracts or purchase orders.\nA performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied by Ashland when control of the product or service is transferred to the customer. The transaction price of a contract or purchase order, or the amount Ashland expects to receive upon satisfaction of all performance obligations, is determined by reference to the contracts terms. Ashland generally collects the cash from its customers within 60 days of the product delivery date. Sales and other similar taxes collected from customers on behalf of third parties are excluded from the contract price.\nAll of Ashlands revenue is derived from contracts or purchase orders with customers, and nearly all contracts or purchase orders with customers contain one performance obligation for the transfer of goods where such performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. Control of a product is deemed to be transferred to the customer generally upon shipment or delivery. Costs for shipping and handling activities, whether performed before or after the customer obtains control of the goods, are accounted for as fulfillment costs when not reimbursed.\nCosts incurred to obtain contracts with customers are not significant and are expensed immediately as the period of performance is generally one year or less. Ashland records credit losses in specific situations when it is determined that the customer is unable to meet its financial obligation.\nExpense recognition\nCost of sales include material and production costs, as well as the costs of inbound and outbound freight, purchasing and receiving, inspection, warehousing, internal transfers and all other distribution network costs. Selling, general and administrative expense includes sales and marketing costs, advertising, customer support, environmental remediation, corporate and divisional administrative and other costs. Advertising costs ($2 million in 2022, $1 million in 2021 and $2 million in 2020) and research and development costs ($55 million in 2022, $50 million in 2021 and $56 million in 2020) are expensed as incurred.\nIncome taxes\nAshland is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid, currently payable or receivable, and deferred taxes. Ashland recognizes the income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Ashland evaluates and adjusts these accruals based on changing facts and circumstances. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax loss and credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the enactment date occurs. Taxes due on future Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) inclusions in U.S. are recognized as a current period expense when incurred. Valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. In the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from Ashlands estimates and assumptions due to changes or future events such as tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material effect on the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information on income taxes, see Note L.\nA progression of activity in the tax valuation allowances is presented in the following table.\n(In millions)\nTax valuation allowances - beginning of year\n$\n$\n$\nAdjustments to valuation allowances\n(19\n)\nReserves utilized\n(10\n)\n(10\n)\nTax valuation allowances - end of year\n$\n$\n$\nAsbestos-related litigation\nAshland is subject to liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Such claims result from indemnification obligations undertaken in 1990 in connection with the sale of Riley Stoker Corporation (Riley) and the acquisition of Hercules in November 2008. Although Riley, a former subsidiary, was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos, its industrial boilers contained some asbestos-containing components provided by other companies. Hercules, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Ashland, has liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Such claims typically arise from alleged exposure to asbestos fibers from resin encapsulated pipe and tank products sold by one of Hercules former subsidiaries to a limited industrial market.\nAshland retained Gnarus Advisors LLC (Gnarus) to assist in developing and annually updating independent reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs given various assumptions. The methodology used to project future asbestos costs is based largely on Ashlands recent experience, including claim-filing and settlement rates, disease mix, open claims, and litigation defense. Ashlands claim experience is compared to the results of previously conducted epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases. Those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population expected to have been exposed to asbestos. Using that information, Gnarus estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed, as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims. Ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs using the results of a non-inflated, non-discounted approximate 40-year model. For additional information on asbestos-related litigation, see Note N.\nEnvironmental remediation\nAccruals for environmental remediation are recognized when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of that liability can be reasonably estimated. Such costs are charged to expense if they relate to the remediation of conditions caused by past operations or are not expected to mitigate or prevent contamination from future operations. Accruals for environmental remediation reflect Ashland's estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period of time to remediate identified conditions for which costs are reasonably estimatible and probable of being incurred, without regard to any third-party recoveries, and are regularly adjusted as environmental assessments and remediation efforts continue. For additional information on environmental remediation, see Note N.\nPension and other postretirement benefits\nThe funded status of Ashlands pension and other postretirement benefit plans is recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at September 30, the measurement date. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and for the other postretirement benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO). The PBO represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement based on estimated future compensation levels. The APBO represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already rendered. The measurement of the benefit obligation is based on Ashlands estimates and actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect the terms of the plans and use participant-specific information such as compensation, age and years of service, as well as certain assumptions that require judgment, including, but not limited to, estimates of discount rates, rate of compensation increases, interest rates and mortality rates. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of assets held by an irrevocable trust fund for the sole benefit of participants. For additional information regarding plan assumptions and the current financial position of the pension and other postretirement plans, see Note M.\nAshland recognizes the change in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement. The remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense are recorded ratably on a quarterly basis. Pension and other postretirement benefits adjustments charged directly to cost of sales that are applicable to inactive participants are excluded from inventoriable costs. The service cost component of pension and other postretirement benefits costs is allocated to each reportable segment on a ratable basis; while the remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits costs are recorded within the other net periodic benefit income (costs) caption on the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nForeign currency translation\nOperations outside the United States are measured primarily using the local currency as the functional currency. Upon consolidation, the results of operations of the subsidiaries and affiliates whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates for the year while assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Adjustments to translate assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are recorded in the stockholders equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are included in net earnings only upon sale or substantial liquidation of the underlying foreign subsidiary or affiliated company.\nStock incentive plans\nAshland recognizes compensation expense for stock incentive plans awarded to key employees and directors, primarily in the form of stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance shares and other non-vested stock awards, that are generally based upon the grant-date fair value over the appropriate vesting period. Ashland utilizes several industry accepted valuation models to determine the fair value. For further information concerning stock incentive plans, see Note P.\nEarnings per share\nThe following is the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations attributable to Ashland. Earnings per share are reported under the treasury stock method. SARs and warrants for each reported year whose grant price was greater than the market price of Ashland Common Stock at the end of each fiscal year were not included in the computation of earnings per share from continuing operations per diluted share because the effect of these instruments would be antidilutive. The total number of these shares outstanding was 1.2 million for 2022, 1.2 million for 2021 and 1.7 million for 2020.\n(In millions except per share data)\nNumerator\nNumerator for basic and diluted EPS - Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax\n$\n$\n$\n(555\n)\nDenominator\nDenominator for basic EPS - Weighted-average common shares outstanding\nShare based awards convertible to common shares (a)\n-\nDenominator for diluted EPS - Adjusted weighted - average shares and assumed conversions\nEPS from continuing operations\nBasic\n$\n3.26\n$\n2.85\n$\n(9.16\n)\nDiluted\n3.20\n2.82\n(9.16\n)\n(a)As a result of the loss from continuing operations for 2020, the effect of approximately one million share-based awards convertible to common shares would be antidilutive. In accordance with US GAAP, they have been excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.\nOther accounting pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. The amended accounting guidance changes the impairment model for most financial assets to require measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. This guidance became effective for Ashland on October 1, 2020. As a result, Ashland recorded a $3 million increase in its allowance for credit losses, primarily related to asbestos receivables, and a $2 million decrease to retained earnings, net of tax, reflecting the cumulative effect on retained earnings. Under the new expected credit loss model, Ashland records an allowance for credit losses inherent in its receivables from revenue transactions and reinsurance recoverables. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account deducted from the amortized cost basis of the assets to present their net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected. Ashland estimates expected credit losses based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. When measuring expected credit losses, Ashland pools assets with similar country risk and credit risk characteristics. Each period the allowance for credit losses is adjusted through earnings to reflect expected credit losses over the remaining lives of the assets. No significant credit losses were incurred in 2022 and 2021.\nNOTE B - ACQUISITIONS\nPersonal Care acquisition\nOn April 30, 2021, Ashland completed its acquisition of the personal care business of Sch\u00fclke & Mayr GmbH (Sch\u00fclke), a portfolio company of the global investment organization EQT. Ashland has included the purchase of this business within the Personal Care reporting segment.\nPurchase price allocation\nThe acquisition was recorded by Ashland using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with applicable U.S. GAAP whereby the total purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on respective fair values.\nThe all-cash purchase price of Sch\u00fclke was $312 million. Ashland incurred acquisition related transaction cost of $4 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, which are recorded within the income on acquisitions and divestitures caption within the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). Within this same caption, Ashland recognized income of $1 million during the year ended September 30, 2021, associated with gains on foreign derivative exchange contracts entered into to mitigate the exposure of the Euro dominated purchase price. The following table summarizes the finalized values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition.\nAt\nApril 30, 2021\nPurchase price allocation (in millions)\nAs Adjusted\nAssets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\nAccounts receivable\nInventories\nNet property, plant and equipment\nGoodwill\nIntangibles\nLiabilities:\nTrade and other payables\n(3\n)\nDeferred income taxes\n(17\n)\nEmployee benefit obligations\n(6\n)\nTotal purchase price (a)\n$\n(a)Total purchase price less acquired cash and cash equivalents was $309 million.\nGoodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. The factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill were based on strategic and synergistic benefits expected to be realized from the acquisition. A portion of the goodwill associated with foreign asset deal entities is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.\nIntangible assets identified\nThe purchase price allocation included $183 million of certain definite-lived intangible assets which are being amortized over the estimated useful life in proportion to the economic benefits consumed. The determination of the useful lives is based upon various industry studies, historical acquisition experience, economic factors, and future cash flows of the combined company. In addition, Ashland reviewed certain technological trends and also considered the relative stability and retention rates in the current Sch\u00fclke personal care customer base.\nThe following details the total intangible assets identified as of April 30, 2021.\nWeighted-average\namortization period\nIntangible asset type (in millions)\nValue\n(years)\nTrademarks and trade names\n$\nIntellectual property\nCustomer and supplier relationships\nTotal\n$\nNOTE C - DIVESTITURES\nPerformance Adhesives\nOn February 28, 2022, Ashland completed the sale of its Performance Adhesives business to Arkema, a French soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme. Proceeds from the sale were approximately $1.7 billion, net of transaction costs. Ashland recognized a $726 million after-tax gain on sale within the Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022.\nThe transaction represented a strategic shift in Ashlands business and had a major effect on Ashlands operations and financial results. Accordingly, the operating results and cash flows related to Performance Adhesives have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows, while the assets and liabilities that were sold have been classified within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as held for sale in periods preceding the sale. See Note D for the results of operations for Performance Adhesives for all periods presented.\nCertain indirect corporate costs included within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) that were previously allocated to the Performance Adhesives segment do not qualify for classification within discontinued operations and are now reported as selling, general and administrative expense within continuing operations on a consolidated basis and within the Unallocated and other segment. These costs were $9 million, $15 million and $20 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 respectively.\nMaleic\nOn September 30, 2020, Ashland completed the sale of its Maleic business to AOC Materials LLC (AOC). Net proceeds from the sale were approximately $98 million. As a result of the sale, Ashland recognized a $29 million after-tax gain within the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) within the income from discontinued operations caption for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020.\nSince the Maleic business was operated under the Composites business and Marl facility disposal group which signified a strategic shift in Ashlands business and had a major effect on Ashlands operations and financial results, the operating results and cash flows related to the Maleic business, have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. See Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the results of operations for the Maleic business, for all periods presented.\nOther manufacturing facility sales\nDuring 2020, Ashland entered into a definitive sale agreement to sell a Specialty Additives facility, the assets and liabilities of which were classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2020. During 2021, Ashland completed the sale of the Specialty Additives facility. Net proceeds received from the sale were approximately $20 million ($14 million and $6 million received during the twelve months September 30 2021 and 2020, respectively). The company recognized a pre-tax gain of $14 million recorded within the income on acquisitions and divestitures caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021.\nAshland determined this transaction did not qualify for discontinued operations treatment since it did not represent a strategic shift that had or will have a major effect on Ashlands operations and financial results.\nOther corporate assets\nAshland sometimes pursues to divest corporate assets, primarily related to land and buildings. When sales for these assets are expected to close within 12 months, they are classified as held for sale. During 2022, Ashland completed the sale of two excess land properties with a net book value of $8 million as of September 30, 2021. Ashland received net proceeds of approximately $50 million and recorded pre-tax gain of $42 million within the income on acquisitions and divestitures caption within the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for 2022. During 2020, Ashland completed the sale of an office building with a net book value of $6 million and received net proceeds of $5 million. As a result, Ashland recognized a loss of $1 million before tax. The loss was reported within the income on acquisitions and divestitures caption within the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for 2020\nHeld for sale classification\nThe assets and liabilities of the Performance Adhesives segment, along with other properties, have been reflected as assets and liabilities held for sale as described above. As a result, in accordance with U.S. GAAP standards, depreciation and amortization were not being recorded within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) and the Consolidated Balance Sheets. There were no assets classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2022. These assets and liabilities were comprised of the following components as of September 30, 2021:\n(In millions)\nAccounts receivable, net\n$\nInventories\nNet property, plant and equipment\nGoodwill\nOperating lease assets, net\nOther assets\nCurrent assets held for sale\n$\nTrade and other payables\n$\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities\nCurrent operating lease obligations\nOperating lease obligations\nCurrent labilities held for sale\n$\nNOTE D - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nAshland has divested certain businesses that have qualified as discontinued operations. The operating results from these divested businesses and subsequent adjustments related to ongoing assessments and activities of certain retained liabilities and tax items have been recorded within the discontinued operations caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for all periods presented and are discussed further within this note.\nAs previously described in Note C, Ashland completed the sale of its Performance Adhesives segment to Arkema during 2022. Ashland determined that this disposal group qualified as a discontinued operation, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, since it represents a strategic shift for Ashland and had a major effect on Ashland's operations and financial results. Accordingly, the operating results and cash flows for the Performance Adhesives segment have been classified as discontinued operations within the Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented.\nAshland has completed the previously announced sale its Maleic business to AOC during 2020. Ashland determined that this business (which was part of the Composites and the Marl facility disposal group) qualified as a discontinued operation, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, since it represents a strategic shift for Ashland and had a major effect on Ashland's operations and financial results. Accordingly, the operating results and cash flows for the Maleic business have been classified as discontinued operations within the Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented.\nDuring 2019, Ashland completed the sale of the Composites business and Marl facility. Ashland determined that this sale qualifies as a discontinued operation, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, since Ashland does not have significant continuing involvement in the Composites business. Ashland has made subsequent adjustments to the discontinued operations caption related to this sale.\nDuring 2017, Ashland completed the separation of Valvoline Inc. (Valvoline). Ashland determined that this sale qualified as a discontinued operation, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, since Ashland does not have significant continuing involvement in the Valvoline business. Ashland has made subsequent adjustments to the discontinued operations caption related to the separation.\nDuring 2014, Ashland completed the sale of the Ashland Water Technologies (Water Technologies) business. Ashland determined that this sale qualified as a discontinued operation, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, since Ashland does not have significant continuing involvement in the Water Technologies business. Ashland has made subsequent adjustments to the discontinued operations caption related to the sale.\nDuring 2011, Ashland completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of its global distribution business, which previously comprised the Ashland Distribution (Distribution) reportable segment. Ashland determined that this sale qualified as a discontinued\noperation, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, since Ashland does not have significant continuing involvement in the Distribution business. Ashland has made subsequent adjustments to the discontinued operations caption related to the sale.\nAshland is subject to liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Such claims result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in 1990 in connection with the sale of Riley Stoker Corporation (Riley), a former subsidiary, which qualified as a discontinued operation and from the acquisition during 2009 of Hercules LLC (formerly Hercules Incorporated), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Ashland. Adjustments to the recorded litigation reserves and related insurance receivables are recorded within the discontinued operations caption. See Note N for more information related to the adjustments on asbestos liabilities and receivables.\nDue to the ongoing assessment of certain matters associated with previous divestitures, subsequent adjustments to these divestitures may continue in future periods in the discontinued operations caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). Components of amounts reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) related to discontinued operations are presented in the following table for each of the years ended September 30.\n(In millions)\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations\nPerformance Adhesives\n$\n$\n$\nComposites/Marl facility (including Maleic)\n-\n(1\n)\nValvoline\n(7\n)\n(33\n)\n(24\n)\nWater Technologies\n(4\n)\n-\nDistribution\n(9\n)\n(6\n)\n(10\n)\nAsbestos-related litigation\n(17\n)\n(11\n)\n(18\n)\nGain on disposal of discontinued operations\nPerformance Adhesives\n1,063\n-\n-\nComposites/Marl facility (including Maleic)\n-\n(4\n)\nWater Technologies\n-\n-\nIncome before taxes\n1,068\nIncome tax benefit (expense)\nBenefit (expense) related to income (loss) from discontinued operations\nPerformance Adhesives\n(19\n)\n(10\n)\nComposites/Marl facility (including Maleic)\n(5\n)\nValvoline\n-\nWater Technologies\n(1\n)\n-\nDistribution\nAsbestos-related litigation\n-\nExpense related to gain on disposal of discontinued operations\nPerformance Adhesives\n(337\n)\n-\n-\nComposites/Marl facility (including Maleic)\n-\n-\n(8\n)\nIncome from discontinued operations (net of taxes)\n$\n$\n$\nPerformance adhesives divestiture\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the captions within Ashlands Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss) for the income from discontinued operations attributable to the Performance Adhesives segment for each of the years ended September 30.\n(In millions)\nIncome(loss) from discontinued operations attributable to\nPerformance Adhesives\nSales\n$\n$\n$\nCost of sales\n(122\n)\n(256\n)\n(202\n)\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n(12\n)\n(25\n)\n(24\n)\nResearch and development expense\n(4\n)\n(8\n)\n(8\n)\nIntangible amortization expense\n-\n(1\n)\n(1\n)\nPretax operating income of discontinued operations\nOther net periodic benefit income (loss)\n-\n(1\n)\nPretax income of discontinued operations\nIncome tax expense\n(19\n)\n(10\n)\nIncome from discontinued operations\n$\n$\n$\nComposites and Marl divestiture\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the captions within Ashlands Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss) for the income from discontinued operations attributable to the Maleic business for 2020. The Maleic business, which was sold during 2020 to AOC, was operated under the Composites business and Marl facility disposal group, and is therefore reported in discontinued operations.

As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the severance reserves associated with this transition were $1 million and $6 million, respectively.\nThe following table details at September 30, 2022 and 2021, the amount of restructuring severance reserves related to this program. The severance reserves were primarily recorded within accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\n(In millions)\nSeverance costs\nBalance as of September 30, 2020\n$\nRestructuring reserve\n(1\n)\nUtilization (cash paid)\n(32\n)\nBalance as of September 30, 2021\n$\nRestructuring reserve\n(2\n)\nUtilization (cash paid)\n(3\n)\nBalance as of September 30, 2022\n$\nImpairments\nDuring 2021, Ashland incurred $3 million of asset impairment charges related to restructuring activities at a plant originating from the shutdown of a product line recorded within the cost of sales caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). In addition, Ashland incurred a $10 million capital project impairment recorded within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nNOTE F - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, Ashland uses applicable guidance for defining fair value, the initial recording and periodic remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value and related disclosures for instruments measured at fair value. Fair value accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). An instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instruments fair value measurement. The three levels within the fair value hierarchy are described as follows.\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for which there is little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs reflect Ashlands own assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might include Ashlands own financial data such as internally developed pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, as well as instruments for which the fair value determination requires significant management judgment.\nFor assets that are measured using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1), the total fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs. Assets and liabilities that are measured using significant other observable inputs (Level 2) are primarily valued by reference to quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets, adjusted for any terms specific to that asset or liability. For all other assets and liabilities for which unobservable inputs are used (Level 3), fair value is derived through the use of fair value models, such as a discounted cash flow model or other standard pricing models that Ashland deems reasonable.\nThe following table summarizes financial instruments subject to recurring fair value measurements as of September 30, 2022. For additional information on fair value hierarchy measurements of pension plan asset holdings, see Note M.\nQuoted prices\nin active\nSignificant\nmarkets for\nother\nSignificant\nidentical\nobservable\nunobservable\nCarrying\nTotal fair\nassets\ninputs\ninputs\n(In millions)\nvalue\nvalue\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\nRestricted investments (a) (b)\n-\n-\nInvestments of captive insurance company (c)\n-\n-\nForeign currency derivatives (d)\n-\n-\nCommodity derivatives (d)\n-\n-\nTotal assets at fair value\n$\n1,034\n$\n1,034\n$\n1,029\n$\n$\n-\nLiabilities\nForeign currency derivatives (e)\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n$\n-\nCommodity derivatives (e)\n-\n-\nTotal liabilities at fair value\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n$\n-\n(a)\tIncluded in restricted investments and $61 million within other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(b)\tIncludes $245 million related to the Asbestos trust and $129 million related to the Environmental trust.

The financial instruments are designated as investment securities, classified as Level 1 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. These securities were classified\nprimarily as noncurrent restricted investment assets, with $61 million and $37 million classified within other current assets, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the periods ended in September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe following table presents gross unrealized gains and losses for the restricted securities as of September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nGross\nGross\n(In millions)\nAdjusted Cost\nUnrealized Gain\nUnrealized Loss\nFair Value\nAs of September 30, 2022\nDemand deposit\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\nEquity mutual fund\n(25\n)\nFixed income mutual fund\n-\n(47\n)\nFair value\n$\n$\n$\n(72\n)\n$\nAs of September 30, 2021\nDemand deposit\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\nEquity mutual fund\n(1\n)\nFixed income mutual fund\n(1\n)\nFair value\n$\n$\n$\n(2\n)\n$\nThe following table presents the investment income, net gains and losses, funds restricted for specific transactions and disbursements related to the investments within the restricted investments portfolio during 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n(In millions)\nInvestment income\n$\n$\n$\nNet gains (losses)\n(102\n)\nFunds restricted for specific transactions\nDisbursements\n(35\n)\n(33\n)\n(35\n)\nForeign currency derivatives\nAshland conducts business in a variety of foreign currencies. Accordingly, Ashland regularly uses foreign currency derivative instruments to manage exposure on certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies to curtail potential earnings volatility effects of certain assets and liabilities, including short-term inter-company loans denominated in currencies other than Ashlands functional currency of an entity. These derivative contracts generally require exchange of one foreign currency for another at a fixed rate at a future date and generally have maturities of less than twelve months. All contracts are valued at fair value with net changes in fair value recorded within the selling, general and administrative expense caption. The impacts of these contracts were largely offset by gains and losses resulting from the impact of changes in exchange rates on transactions denominated in non-functional currencies.\nThe following table summarizes the gains and losses recognized during 2022, 2021 and 2020 within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n(In millions)\nForeign currency derivative gain (loss) (a)\n$\n(40\n)\n$\n$\n(a)\tIncludes a $1 million gain reported within the income from acquisitions and divestitures captured for fiscal 2021.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivatives as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 included in accounts receivable and accrued expenses and other liabilities of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(In millions)\nForeign currency derivative assets\n$\n$\nNotional contract values\nForeign currency derivative liabilities\n$\n$\nNotional contract values\nCommodity derivatives\nTo manage its exposure to the market price volatility of natural gas consumed by its U.S. plants during the manufacturing process, Ashland regularly enters into forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges.

The fair values of long-term debt are based on quoted market prices or, if market prices are not available, the present values of the underlying cash flows discounted at Ashlands incremental borrowing rates, which are deemed to be Level 2 measurements within the fair value hierarchy.\nNOTE G - PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nThe following table describes the various components of property, plant and equipment within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\n(In millions)\nLand\n$\n$\nBuildings\nMachinery and equipment\n2,324\n2,278\nConstruction in progress\nTotal property, plant and equipment (gross)\n3,050\n3,066\nAccumulated depreciation\n(1,712\n)\n(1,639\n)\nTotal property, plant and equipment (net)\n$\n1,338\n$\n1,427\nThe following table summarizes various property, plant and equipment charges recognized during 2022, 2021, 2020 within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\n(In millions)\nDepreciation\n$\n$\n$\nCapitalized interest\nNOTE H - GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES\nGoodwill\nAshland performed its annual goodwill impairment test using the quantitative approach as of July 1, 2022 and concluded that the reporting unit fair values for all reporting units exceeded their carrying values. No impairment existed as of that date and no subsequent impairment indicators have been identified.\nThe following is a progression of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\n(In millions)\nLife\nSciences\nPersonal Care (a)\nSpecialty\nAdditives (a)\nIntermediates (a)\nTotal\nBalance at September 30, 2020\n$\n$\n-\n$\n$\n-\n$\n1,305\nAcquisitions (b)\n-\n-\n-\nCurrency translation and other\n(5\n)\n(2\n)\n-\n(6\n)\nBalance at September 30, 2021\n-\n1,430\nCurrency translation and other\n(69\n)\n(11\n)\n(38\n)\n-\n(118\n)\nBalance at September 30, 2022\n$\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n1,312\n(a)As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, there was accumulated impairment of $356 million, $174 million, and $90 million related to the Personal Care, Specialty Additives, and Intermediates reportable segments, respectively. The accumulated impairments for Personal Care and Specialty Additives were recorded in fiscal 2020 within the goodwill impairment caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n(b)Relates to the acquisition of the Sch\u00fclke personal care business during 2021. See Note B for more information.\nOther intangible assets\nIntangible assets principally consist of trademarks and trade names, intellectual property and customer and supplier relationships. Intangible assets classified as finite are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The cost of trademarks and trade names is amortized principally over 3 to 20 years, intellectual property over 3 to 20 years, and customer and supplier relationships over 10 to 24 years.\nAshland performed its annual impairment test for other indefinite lived intangible assets using the quantitative approach as of July 1, 2022 and concluded that the assets fair values exceeded their carrying values. No impairment existed as of that date.\nOther intangible assets were comprised of the following as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nGross\nNet\nGross\nNet\ncarrying\nAccumulated\ncarrying\ncarrying\nAccumulated\ncarrying\n(In millions)\namount\namortization\namount\namount\namortization\namount\nDefinite-lived intangible assets\nTrademarks and trade names\n$\n$\n(37\n)\n$\n$\n$\n(32\n)\n$\nIntellectual property\n(523\n)\n(495\n)\nCustomer and supplier relationships\n(369\n)\n(352\n)\nTotal definite-lived intangible assets\n1,614\n(929\n)\n1,700\n(879\n)\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets\nTrademarks and trade names\n-\n-\nTotal intangible assets\n$\n1,892\n$\n(929\n)\n$\n$\n1,978\n$\n(879\n)\n$\n1,099\nAmortization expense recognized on intangible assets was $94 million for 2022, $90 million for 2021 and $84 million for 2020, and is included in the intangibles amortization expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). As of September 30, 2022, all of Ashlands intangible assets that had a carrying value were being amortized except for certain trademarks and trade names that have been determined to have indefinite lives. Estimated amortization expense for future periods is $94 million in 2023, $79 million in 2024, $74 million in 2025, $70 million in 2026 and $47 million in 2027. The amortization expense for future periods is an estimate. Actual amounts may change from such estimated amounts due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, additional intangible asset acquisitions and divestitures, potential impairment, accelerated amortization, or other events.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible assets\nAshlands assessment of an impairment on any of these assets classified currently as having indefinite lives, including goodwill, could change in future periods if significant events happen and/or circumstances change that effect the previously mentioned assumptions such as: a significant change in projected business result, a divestiture decision, increase in Ashlands weighted-average cost of capital rates, decrease in growth rates or assumptions, economic deterioration that is more severe or of a longer duration than anticipated, or another significant economic event.\nNOTE I - DEBT\nThe following table summarizes Ashlands current and long-term debt at September 30, 2022 and 2021.\n(In millions)\n3.375% Senior Notes, due 2031\n$\n$\n2.00% Senior Notes, due 2028 (Euro 500 million principal)\n6.875% notes, due 2043\nTerm loan A\n-\nAccounts receivable securitizations\n-\n6.50% junior subordinated notes, due 2029\nRevolving credit facility\n-\nOther (a)\n(11\n)\nTotal debt\n1,270\n1,970\nShort-term debt (includes current portion of long-term debt)\n-\n(374\n)\nLong-term debt (less current portion and debt issuance costs)\n$\n1,270\n$\n1,596\n(a)Other includes $14 million and $17 million of debt issuance costs as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, as of September 30, 2021 Other included a European short-term loan facility with an outstanding balance of $23 million.\nAt September 30, 2022, Ashlands total debt had an outstanding principal balance of $1,321 million, discounts of $37 million and debt issuance costs of $14 million. As of September 30, 2022, Ashland had no long-term debt (excluding debt issuance costs) maturing within the next 4 years and $4 million due in fiscal 2027.\nCredit Agreements and Refinancing\nNote Issuances\nDuring August 2021, Ashland, through one of its subsidiaries, completed the issuance of 3.375% senior unsecured notes due 2031 with an aggregate principal amount of $450 million (the 2031 Notes). The notes are guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Ashland. Ashland used the net proceeds of the offering (after deducting initial purchasers' discounts and other fees and expenses) to redeem its obligations under the existing 4.750% senior notes due 2022 described below in debt repayments, and to pay fees and expenses associated therewith.\nAshland incurred $6 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the 2031 Notes, which is amortized using the effective interest method over the 2031 Notes' term and was included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nDuring January 2020, a subsidiary of Ashland, Ashland Services B.V., completed the issuance of 2.00% senior unsecured notes due 2028 with an aggregate principal amount of \u20ac500 million (the 2028 Notes). The notes are senior unsecured obligations of Ashland Services B.V and are guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Ashland.\nAshland incurred $8 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the 2028 Notes, which is amortized using the effective interest method over the 2028 Notes term.\n2020 Credit Agreement\nDuring January 2020, Ashland, through two of its subsidiaries, entered into a new senior unsecured credit agreement (the 2020 Credit Agreement) with a group of lenders, replacing the 2017 Credit Agreement. The 2020 Credit Agreement provided for (i) a $600 million unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility) and (ii) a $250 million unsecured five-year term loan facility (the 2020 Term Loan Facility). Proceeds of borrowings under the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility were used to refinance the Ashlands existing 2017 Credit Agreement, to provide ongoing working capital and for other general corporate purposes.\nAshland incurred $4 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the 2020 Credit Agreement, of which $1 million was expensed immediately during 2020 within the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). The remaining balance is amortized using the straight-line method.\nDuring July 2022, Ashland, through two of its subsidiaries, enacted an amendment to the 2020 credit agreement. The amended credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement) provides for a $600 million five-year revolving credit facility (the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility). The 2022 Credit Agreement and the obligations of Ashland Services B.V. under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by Ashland.\nAt Ashlands option, loans issued under the 2022 Credit Agreement will bear interest at (a) in the case of loans denominated in U.S. dollars, either Term SOFR or an alternate base rate and (b) in the case of loans denominated in Euros, EURIBOR, in each case plus the applicable interest rate margin. Loans will initially bear interest at Term SOFR or EURIBOR plus 1.250% per annum, in the case of Term SOFR borrowings or EURIBOR borrowings, respectively, or at the alternate base rate plus 0.250% per annum, in the case of alternate base rate borrowings, through and including the date of delivery of a quarterly compliance certificate and thereafter the interest rate will fluctuate between Term SOFR or EURIBOR plus 1.250% per annum and Term SOFR or EURIBOR plus 1.750% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 0.250% per annum and the alternate base rate plus 0.750% per annum), based upon the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) at such time. Term SOFR borrowings are subject to a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% per annum. In addition, the Company will initially be required to pay fees of 0.125% per annum on the daily unused amount of the Revolving Facility through and including the date of delivery of a quarterly compliance certificate, and thereafter the fee rate will fluctuate between 0.125% and 0.275% per annum, based upon the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio. Borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement may be prepaid at any time without premiums.\nAs a result of the amendment of the 2020 Credit Agreement, Ashland recognized a $1 million charge for accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2022, which is included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). Ashland also incurred $2 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the 2022 Credit Agreement, of which $1 million was expensed immediately during 2022 within the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). The remaining balance is amortized using the straight-line method.\nThe 2022 Credit Agreement contains financial covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios akin to those in effect under the 2020 Credit Agreement. The 2022 Credit Agreement contains usual and customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios, limitations on liens, additional indebtedness, further negative pledges, investments, mergers, sale of assets and restricted payments, and other customary limitations.\nDebt repayments and repurchases\nCash repatriation\nDuring 2022 and 2021, Ashland repatriated approximately $250 million and $131 million, respectively, in cash that was primarily used to repay existing debt, principally portions of the 4.75% senior notes due 2022, the 6.875% senior notes due 2043 and the 6.5% junior notes in 2020 (as previously discussed).\n2022 Debt repayments and repurchases\n2020 Credit Agreement\nDuring 2022, Ashland prepaid its Term loan A principal balance of $250 million.\nOther Debt\nDuring 2022, Ashland repaid the outstanding balance on its European short-term loan facility for $23 million.\n2021 Debt repayments and repurchases\nRedemption of 4.750% senior notes due 2022\nDuring 2021, Ashland redeemed all of its outstanding 4.750% senior notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes), of which approximately $411 million were outstanding. Ashland recognized a $1 million charge related to accelerated accretion on debt discounts and accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs, which is included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nTotal premiums paid for all the tender offers in 2021 noted above were $16 million, which is included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n2020 Debt repayments and repurchases\nTender offers of 4.750% senior notes due 2022\nDuring 2020, Ashland executed tender offers of the 2022 Notes. As a result of these repurchases, the carrying values of the 2022 Notes was reduced by $670 million. Ashland recognized a $5 million charge related to accelerated accretion on debt discounts and accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs, which is included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nTender offers of 6.875% notes due 2043\nDuring 2020, Ashland executed tender offers of its 6.875% notes due 2043 (the 2043 Notes). As a result of these repurchases, the carrying values of the 2043 Notes was reduced by $92 million. Ashland recognized a $1 million charge related to accelerated accretion on debt premiums and accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs, which is included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nTender offers of 6.500% Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2029\nDuring 2020, Ashland executed tender offers of Hercules LLCs 6.500% junior subordinated debentures due 2029 (the 2029 Junior Debentures). As a result of these repurchases, the carrying values of the 2029 Junior Debentures was reduced by $2 million.\nTotal premiums paid for all the tender offers in 2020 noted above were $59 million, which is included in the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nAccounts receivable facilities and off-balance sheet arrangements\nU.S. accounts receivable sales program\nOn March 17, 2021, a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity and consolidated Ashland subsidiary (SPE) entered into an agreement with a group of entities (buyers) to sell certain trade receivables, without recourse beyond the pledged receivables, of two other U.S. based Ashland subsidiaries. Under the agreement, Ashland can transfer whole receivables up to a limit established by the buyer, which is currently set at $125 million between February and October of each year and up to $100 million all other times. Ashlands continuing involvement is limited to servicing the receivables, including billing, collections and remittance of payments to the buyers as well as a limited guarantee on over-collateralization. The arrangement terminates on May 31, 2023, unless terminated earlier pursuant to the terms of the agreement.\nAshland determined that any receivables transferred under this agreement are put presumptively beyond the reach of Ashland and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. Ashland received a true sale at law and non-consolidation opinions to support the legal isolation of these receivables. Ashland accounts for the receivables transferred to buyers as sales. Ashland recognizes any gains or losses based on the excess of proceeds received net of buyers discounts and fees compared to the carrying value of the assets. Proceeds received, net of buyers discounts and fees, are recorded within the operating activities of the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. Losses on sale of assets, including related transaction expenses are recorded within the net interest and other expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). Ashland regularly assesses its servicing obligations and records them as assets or liabilities when appropriate. Ashland also monitors its obligation with regards to the limited guarantee and records the resulting guarantee liability when warranted. When applicable, Ashland discloses the amount of the receivable that serves as over-collateralization as a restricted asset.\nAshland recognized a $1 million loss within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for 2022 and 2021, respectively, within the net interest and other expense caption associated with sales under the program. Ashland has recorded $110 million of sales against the buyers limit, which was $125 million at September 30, 2022, compared to $113 million of sales against the buyer's limit, which was $125 million at September 30, 2021. Ashland transferred $136 million and $167 million in receivables to the SPE as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Ashland recorded liabilities related to its service obligations and limited guarantee as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 of less than $1 million. As of September 30, 2022, the year-to-date gross cash proceeds received for receivables transferred and derecognized was\n$312 million, of which $315 million was collected by Ashland in our capacity as a servicer of the receivables and remitted to the buyer. The difference of $3 million represents the impact of a net reduction in account receivable sales volume during the current year.\n2018 foreign accounts receivable securitization\nDuring July 2018, Ashland entered into a \u20ac115 million accounts receivable securitization facility (the Program) for the transfer by certain subsidiaries of Ashland (the Sellers) directly or indirectly to Ester Finance Titrisation (the Purchaser), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (the Arranger), of certain receivables and/or collections originated by the Sellers towards certain corporate debtors located in multiple European jurisdictions and denominated in multiple currencies. The Program originally had a term of two years, but was extended to August 2021 in September 2019. During July 2021, the termination date of the Program was extended to July 2023. During July 2020, the available funding for qualified receivables under the accounts receivable securitization facility decreased from \u20ac115 million to \u20ac100 million.\nUnder the Program, each Seller will assign, on an ongoing basis, certain of its accounts receivable and the right to the collections on those accounts receivable to the Purchaser. Under the terms of the Program, the Sellers could, from time to time, obtain up to \u20ac100 million from the Purchaser through the sale of an undivided interest in such accounts receivable and collections. Ashland accounts for the securitization facility as secured borrowings, and the receivables sold pursuant to the facility are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts receivable. Fundings under the Program will be repaid as accounts receivable are collected, with new fundings being advanced (through daily advanced purchase price) as new accounts receivable are originated by the Sellers and assigned to the Purchaser, with settlement occurring monthly. Ashland classifies any borrowings under this facility as a short-term debt instrument within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Once sold to the Purchaser, the accounts receivable and rights to collection described above are separate and distinct from each Sellers own assets and are not available to its creditors should such Sellers become insolvent.\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, the outstanding amount of accounts receivable transferred by Ashland to the Purchaser was $162 million and $152 million, respectively, and there were zero and $117 million, respectively, of borrowings (denominated in multiple currencies) under the facility. The weighted-average interest rate for this instrument was 0.5% and 0.6% for 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOther debt\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, Ashland held other debt totaling $63 million and $83 million, respectively, comprised primarily of a European short-term loan facility, the 6.50% notes due 2029 and other notes.\nAvailable borrowing capacity and liquidity\nThe borrowing capacity remaining under the $600 million 2022 Revolving Credit Facility was $581 million due to an outstanding balance of zero, as well as a reduction of $19 million for letters of credit outstanding at September 30, 2022. Ashland's total borrowing capacity at September 30, 2022 was $680 million, which included $99 million of available capacity from the foreign 2018 accounts receivable securitization facility.\nAdditionally, Ashland has zero available liquidity under its current U.S. Accounts Receivable Sales Program.\nCovenants related to current Ashland debt agreements\nAshlands debt contains usual and customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios, limitations on liens, additional subsidiary indebtedness, restrictions on subsidiary distributions, investments, mergers, sale of assets and restricted payments and other customary limitations. As of September 30, 2022, Ashland was in compliance with all debt agreement covenant restrictions.\nThe maximum consolidated net leverage ratio permitted under Ashlands most recent credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement) is 4.0. The 2022 Credit Agreement defines the consolidated net leverage ratio as the ratio of consolidated indebtedness minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to consolidated EBITDA (Covenant Adjusted EBITDA) for any measurement period. In general, the 2022 Credit Agreement defines Covenant Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus consolidated interest charges, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, fees and expenses related to capital market transactions and proposed or actual acquisitions and divestitures, restructuring and integration charges, certain environmental charges, non-cash stock and equity compensation expense, and any other nonrecurring expenses or losses that do not represent a cash item in such period or any future period; less any non-cash gains or other items increasing net income. The computation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA differs from the calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which have been reconciled within Item 7 of this document.\nIn general, consolidated indebtedness includes debt plus all purchase money indebtedness, bankers acceptances and bank guaranties, deferred purchase price of property or services, attributable indebtedness and guarantees. At September 30, 2022, Ashlands calculation of the consolidated net leverage ratio was 1.1.\nThe minimum required consolidated interest coverage ratio under the 2022 Credit Agreement is 3.0. The 2022 Credit Agreement defines the consolidated interest coverage ratio as the ratio of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest charges for any measurement period. At September 30, 2022, Ashlands calculation of the consolidated interest coverage ratio was 10.8.\nGuarantee of senior notes\nAshland Inc. fully and unconditionally guaranteed the 2.00% notes due 2028 and has no significant independent assets or operations.\nNet interest and other expense (income)\n(In millions)\nInterest expense (a)\n$\n$\n$\nInterest income\n(4\n)\n(1\n)\n(1\n)\nLoss on the accounts receivables sale program\n-\nInvestment securities loss (income) (b)\n(33\n)\n(30\n)\nOther financing costs (c)\n$\n$\n$\n(a)\tIncludes $1 million, $1 million and $8 million of accelerated accretion and/or amortization for original issue discounts and debt issuance costs during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(b)\tRepresents investment loss related to the restricted investments discussed in Note F.\n(c)\tIncludes costs of $16 million related to early redemption premium payments for the 2022 notes during 2021, and $59 million related to early redemption premium payments for the 2022 Notes, 2043 Notes and 2029 Junior Debentures during 2020.\nThe following table details the debt issuance cost and original issue discount amortization included in interest expense during 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n(In millions)\nNormal amortization\n$\n$\n$\nAccelerated amortization (a)\nTotal\n$\n$\n$\n(a)Fiscal year 2022 includes $1 million of accelerated debt issuance costs for the 2020 credit agreement. 2021 includes $1 million of accelerated debt issuance cost for the 2022 Notes.

Gains and losses related to deferred compensation investments are immediately recognized within the selling, general and administrative expense caption on the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). These investments had losses of $2 million during 2022 and gains of $10 million during both 2021 and 2020, respectively. During 2022, Ashland liquidated $5 million of deferred compensation investments, which were reinvested in company owned life insurance assets. During 2021, Ashland liquidated $90 million of deferred compensation investments to fund the Environmental trust. Ashland did not liquidate any deferred compensation investments during 2020. These cash inflows exclude company-owned life insurance death benefits of $3 million, $1 million and $7 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Substantially all of Ashlands leases are operating leases or short-term leases. Real estate leases represented over 85% of the total lease liability at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note A for additional information related to Ashlands leasing policies.\nThe components of lease cost recognized within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) were as follows:\n(In millions)\nLocation\nLease cost:\nOperating lease cost\nSelling, General & Administrative\n$\n$\n$\nOperating lease cost\nCost of Sales\nVariable lease cost\nSelling, General & Administrative\nVariable lease cost\nCost of Sales\nShort-term leases\nCost of Sales\nTotal lease cost (a)\n$\n$\n$\n(a) Includes $2 million lease termination fee in fiscal 2022.\nThe following table summarizes Ashlands lease assets and liabilities as presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30:\n(In millions)\nAssets\nOperating lease assets, net\n$\n$\nTotal lease assets\n$\nLiabilities\nCurrent operating lease obligations\n$\n$\nNon-current operating lease obligations\nTotal lease liabilities\n$\n$\nAshland often has options to renew lease terms for buildings and other assets. The exercise of lease renewal options are generally at Ashland's sole discretion. In addition, certain lease arrangements may be terminated prior to their original expiration date at Ashland's discretion. Ashland evaluates renewal and termination options at the lease commencement date to determine if it is reasonably certain to exercise the option on the basis of economic factors. The weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 was approximately 17 and 15 years, respectively.\nResidual value guarantees are not common within Ashland's lease agreements nor are restrictions or covenants imposed by leases. Ashland has elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components. The discount rate implicit within the leases is generally not determinable. Therefore, Ashland determines the discount rate based on its incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using a buildup method resulting in an estimated range of secured borrowing rates matching the lease term and the currency of the jurisdiction in which lease payments are made, adjusted for impacts of collateral. Consideration was given to Ashlands own relevant debt issuances as well as debt instruments of comparable companies with similar credit characteristics. The weighted average discount rate used to measure operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 was 2.6% and 2.8%, respectively. There are no leases that have not yet commenced but that create significant rights and obligations for Ashland.\nRight-of-use assets exchanged for new operating lease obligations was $14 million and $23 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This includes $1 million of right-of-use assets and operating lease obligations recorded as a result of the purchase of Sch\u00fclke personal care business during 2021.\nThe following table provides cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities for during 2022 and 2021:\n(In millions)\nOperating cash flows from operating leases\n$\n$\n$\nThe following table summarizes Ashland's maturities of lease liabilities as of September 30, 2022:\n(In millions)\n$\nThereafter\nTotal lease payments\nLess amount of lease payment representing interest\n(38\n)\nTotal present value of lease payments\n$\nNOTE L - INCOME TAXES\nIncome Tax Provision\nA summary of the provision for income taxes related to continuing operations follows.\n(In millions)\nCurrent\nFederal\n$\n$\n(35\n)\n$\n(4\n)\nState\n(2\n)\n(7\n)\nForeign\n(12\n)\nDeferred\n(35\n)\n(26\n)\n(42\n)\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n$\n$\n(38\n)\n$\n(22\n)\nForeign net operating loss carryforwards primarily relate to certain European and Asian Pacific operations and generally may be carried forward.

The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step requires Ashland to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. The second step requires Ashland to recognize in the financial statements each tax position that meets the more likely than not criteria, measured at the amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. Ashland had $84 million and $82 million of unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, recorded within other noncurrent liabilities. As of September 30, 2022, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the tax rate for continuing and discontinued operations was $56 million. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions for which ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty as to the timing of such deductibility. Recognition of these tax benefits would not have an impact on the effective tax rate.\nAshland recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense (benefit) in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). Such interest and penalties totaled a $3 million expense in 2022, $15 million benefit in 2021 and $8 million expense in 2020. Ashland had $10 million and $11 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nChanges in unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:\n(In millions)\nBalance at September 30, 2020 (a)\n$\nIncreases related to positions taken on items from prior years\nDecreases related to positions taken on items from prior years\n(70\n)\nIncreases related to positions taken in the current year\nLapse of statute of limitations\n(20\n)\nSettlements\n(18\n)\nBalance at September 30, 2021\n$\nDecreases related to positions taken on items from prior years\n(5\n)\nIncreases related to positions taken in the current year\nLapse of statute of limitations\n(12\n)\nBalance at September 30, 2022\n$\n(a)\tAshland has indemnity receivables from Valvoline and Pharmachem for zero and $1 million of the gross unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, recorded within other noncurrent assets.\nFrom a combination of statute expirations and audit settlements in the next twelve months, Ashland expects a decrease in the amount of accrual for uncertain tax positions of between $3 million and $6 million for continuing operations. For the remaining balance as of September 30, 2022, it is reasonably possible that there could be material changes to the amount of uncertain tax positions due to activities of the taxing authorities, settlement of audit issues, reassessment of existing uncertain tax positions or the expiration of applicable statute of limitations; however, Ashland is not able to estimate the impact of these items at this time.\nAshland or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Foreign taxing jurisdictions significant to Ashland include Brazil, China, Germany, Mexico, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and United Kingdom. Ashland is subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for periods after September 30, 2018 and U.S. state income tax examinations by tax authorities for periods after September 30, 2015. With respect to countries outside of the United States, with certain exceptions, Ashlands foreign subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits for years after 2017.\nNOTE M - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nPension plans\nAshland and its subsidiaries have several contributory and noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plans that generally cover international employees and a small portion of certain U.S. manufacturing union employees. Pension obligations for applicable employees of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries are provided for in accordance with local practices and regulations of the respective countries. The majority of these foreign pension plans are closed to new participants while those that remain open relate to areas where jurisdictions require plans to operate within the applicable country.\nBenefits for those eligible for Ashlands U.S. pension plans generally are based on employees years of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding their retirement. The remaining U.S. plans are still open for enrollment for qualifying union employees within certain manufacturing sites.\nOther postretirement benefit plans\nAshland and its subsidiaries maintain limited health care for certain eligible employees in the U.S. who are retired or disabled. Ashland shares the costs of providing health care coverage with certain eligible retired employees through premiums, deductibles and coinsurance provisions. Ashland funds its share of the costs of the postretirement benefit plans as the benefits are paid.\nPostretirement health care plans include a limit on Ashlands share of costs for recent and future retirees. The assumed pre-65 health care cost increase trend rate as of September 30, 2022 was 6.6% and continues to be reduced to 4.5% in 2039 and thereafter. The assumptions used to project the liability anticipate future cost-sharing changes to the written plans that are consistent with the increase in health care costs.\nPlan Amendments and Remeasurements\nFollowing the completion of the sale of its Performance Adhesives business segment on February 28, 2022, the post-retirement benefits for approximately 40 employees transferred to Arkema, all of whom participated in a non-contributory defined benefit plan in the U.S., were\nfrozen. This resulted in a decrease in total expected future years of service within the plan and required Ashland to remeasure the plan as February 28, 2022. As a result, Ashland recorded a $1 million actuarial gain within the other net periodic benefit income (loss) caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for fiscal 2022.\nNet periodic benefit loss (income) allocation\nConsistent with Ashlands historical accounting policies, service cost for continuing operations is proportionately allocated to each reportable segment, excluding the Unallocated and other segment, while all other costs for continuing operations are recorded within the Unallocated and other segment.\nThe following table summarizes the components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs for continuing operations and the assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit loss (income) for the plans.\nPension benefits\nOther postretirement benefits\n(In millions)\nNet periodic benefit loss (income)\nService cost (a)\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nInterest cost (b)\nCurtailment, settlement and other (b)\n(1\n)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nExpected return on plan assets (b)\n(7\n)\n(8\n)\n(11\n)\n-\n-\n-\nActuarial (gain) loss (b)\n(16\n)\n(8\n)\n(2\n)\n(2\n)\n$\n(12\n)\n$\n$\n$\n(5\n)\n$\n$\nWeighted-average plan assumptions (c)\nDiscount rate for service cost\n2.99\n%\n1.81\n%\n1.84\n%\n3.19\n%\n3.15\n%\n3.39\n%\nDiscount rate for interest cost\n3.33\n%\n1.69\n%\n2.16\n%\n2.10\n%\n1.93\n%\n2.76\n%\nRate of compensation increase\n2.50\n%\n2.53\n%\n2.51\n%\nExpected long-term rate of return\non plan assets\n2.89\n%\n2.43\n%\n3.05\n%\n(a)\tService cost is classified within the selling, general and administrative expense and cost of sales captions on the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n(b)\tThese components are classified within the other net periodic benefit income (loss) caption on the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n(c)\tThe plan assumptions discussed are a blended weighted-average rate for Ashlands U.S. and non-U.S. plans.\nThe changes in prior service credit recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income during both 2022 and 2021 were less than $1 million each. At September 30, 2022, Ashland expects to recognize less than $1 million of the prior service credit in accumulated other comprehensive income as net periodic benefit income (loss) during the next fiscal year.\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, the amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income are shown in the following table.\nPension\nPostretirement\n(In millions)\nPrior service cost\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\nObligations and funded status\nActuarial valuations are performed for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans to determine Ashlands obligation for each plan.

Information for pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets follows:\n(In millions)\nProjected benefit obligation\n$\n$\nAccumulated benefit obligation\nFair value of plan assets\nPlan assets\nThe expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was 2.89% and 2.43% for September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The basis for determining the expected long-term rate of return is a combination of future return assumptions for various asset classes in Ashlands investment portfolio, historical analysis of previous returns, market indices and a projection of inflation.\nThe following table summarizes the various investment categories that the pension plan assets are invested in and the applicable fair value hierarchy that the financial instruments are classified within these investment categories as of September 30, 2022.

Investments classified as a Level 1 fair value measure principally represent marketable securities priced in active markets. Cash and cash equivalents and public equity and debt securities are well diversified and invested in U.S. and international small-to-large companies across various asset managers and styles. Investments classified as a Level 2 fair value measure principally represents fixed-income securities and other investment grade corporate bonds and debt obligations.\nInvestments and Strategy\nIn developing an investment strategy for its defined benefit plans, Ashland has considered the following factors: the nature of the plans liabilities, the allocation of liabilities between active, deferred and retired members, the funded status of the plans, the applicable investment horizon, the respective size of the plans and historical and expected capital market returns. Ashlands U.S. pension plan assets are managed by outside investment managers, which are monitored against investment return benchmarks and Ashlands established investment strategy. Investment managers are selected based on an analysis of, among other things, their investment process, historical investment results, frequency of management turnover, cost structure and assets under management. Assets are periodically reallocated between investment managers to maintain an appropriate asset mix and diversification of investments and to optimize returns.\nThe current asset allocation for the U.S. plans is 42.5% fixed income securities, 42% equity securities and 15.5% other securities. Fixed income securities primarily include cash and cash equivalents, long duration corporate debt obligations and U.S. government debt obligations. In addition, Ashlands non-U.S. plan fixed income securities include insurance contracts. Equity securities are comprised solely of traditional public equity investments. Investment managers may employ a limited use of derivatives to gain efficient exposure to markets.\nAshlands investment strategy and management practices relative to plan assets of non-U.S. plans generally are consistent with those for U.S. plans, except in those countries where investment of plan assets is dictated by applicable regulations. Although the investment allocation may vary based on funding percentages and whether plans are still accruing additional liabilities, the weighted-average asset allocations for Ashlands U.S. and non-U.S. plans at September 30, 2022 and 2021 by asset category follow.\nActual at September 30\n(In millions)\nTarget\nPlan assets allocation\nEquity securities\n5 - 45%\n%\n%\nFixed income securities\n55 - 95%\n%\n%\nOther\n0 - 5%\n%\n%\n%\n%\nCash flows\nDuring 2022 and 2021, Ashland contributed less than $1 million and $2 million to its U.S. pension plans, respectively, and $5 million and $6 million to its non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. Ashland does not expect to contribute to its U.S. pension plans and expects to contribute approximately $4 million to its non-U.S. pension plans during 2023.\nThe following benefit payments, which reflect future service expectations, are projected to be paid from plan assets in each of the next five years and in aggregate for five years thereafter.\nOther\nPension\npostretirement\n(In millions)\nbenefits\nbenefits\n$\n$\n2028 - 2032\nOther plans\nAshland sponsors savings plans to assist eligible employees in providing for retirement or other future needs. Under such plans, company contributions amounted to $23 million, $21 million, and $24 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Ashland also sponsors various other employee benefit plans, some of which are required by different countries. The total noncurrent liabilities associated with these plans were $4 million and $5 million for September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNOTE N - LITIGATION, CLAIMS AND CONTINGENCIES\nAsbestos litigation\nAshland and Hercules have liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. To assist in developing and annually updating independent reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs, Ashland has retained third party actuarial experts Gnarus. The methodology used by Gnarus to project future asbestos costs is based largely on recent experience, including claim-filing and settlement rates, disease mix, open claims and litigation defense. The claim experience of Ashland and Hercules are separately compared to the results of previously conducted third party epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases. Those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population expected to have been exposed to asbestos. Using that information, Gnarus estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed, as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims. Changes in asbestos-related liabilities and receivables are recorded on an after-tax basis within the discontinued operations caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nAshland asbestos-related litigation\nThe claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos asserted against Ashland result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in 1990 in connection with the sale of Riley, a former subsidiary. The amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate from period to period. A summary of Ashland asbestos claims activity, excluding Hercules claims, follows.\n(In thousands)\nOpen claims - beginning of year\nNew claims filed\nClaims settled\n(1\n)\n(1\n)\n(1\n)\nClaims dismissed\n(3\n)\n(4\n)\n(5\n)\nOpen claims - end of year\nAshland asbestos-related liability\nFrom the range of estimates, Ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs. Ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non-inflated, non-discounted approximate 40-year model developed with the assistance of Gnarus.\nDuring the most recent update completed during 2022, it was determined that the liability for Ashland asbestos-related claims should be increased by $16 million. Total reserves for asbestos claims were $305 million at September 30, 2022 compared to $320 million at September 30, 2021.\nA progression of activity in the asbestos reserve is presented in the following table.\n(In millions)\nAsbestos reserve - beginning of year\n$\n$\n$\nReserve adjustment\nAmounts paid\n(31\n)\n(27\n)\n(30\n)\nAsbestos reserve - end of year (a)\n$\n$\n$\n(a)\tIncluded $29 million classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nAshland asbestos-related receivables\nAshland has insurance coverage for certain litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in connection with its asbestos claims, and coverage-in-place agreements exist with the insurance companies that provide substantially all of the coverage that will be accessed.\nFor the Ashland asbestos-related obligations, Ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on managements interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage, including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent. Substantially all of the estimated receivables from insurance companies are expected to be due from domestic insurers, all of which are solvent.\nAt September 30, 2022, Ashlands receivable for recoveries of litigation defense and claim settlement costs from insurers amounted to $101 million (excluding the Hercules receivable for asbestos claims discussed below). Receivables from insurers amounted to $100 million at\nSeptember 30, 2021. During 2022, the annual update of the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers, was completed. This model update resulted in a $7 million increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries.\nA progression of activity in the Ashland insurance receivable is presented in the following table.\n(In millions)\nInsurance receivable - beginning of year\n$\n$\n$\nReceivable adjustment (a)\nInsurance settlement\n-\n-\n(10\n)\nAmounts collected\n(6\n)\n(9\n)\n(11\n)\nInsurance receivable - end of year (b)\n$\n$\n$\n(a)\t2021 includes a $2 million reserve adjustment related to allowances for credit losses as a result of Ashland's adoption of the new credit measurement standard described in Note A.

Such claims typically arise from alleged exposure to asbestos fibers from resin encapsulated pipe and tank products which were sold by one of Hercules former subsidiaries to a limited industrial market. The amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate from period to period. A summary of Hercules asbestos claims activity follows.\n(In thousands)\nOpen claims - beginning of year\nNew claims filed\nClaims dismissed\n(2\n)\n(1\n)\n(2\n)\nOpen claims - end of year\nHercules asbestos-related liability\nFrom the range of estimates, Ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs. Ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non-inflated, non-discounted approximate 40-year model developed with the assistance of Gnarus. As a result of the most recent annual update of this estimate, completed during 2022, it was determined that the liability for Hercules asbestos-related claims should be increased by $15 million. Total reserves for asbestos claims were $213 million at September 30, 2022 compared to $217 million at September 30, 2021.\nA progression of activity in the asbestos reserve is presented in the following table.\n(In millions)\nAsbestos reserve - beginning of year\n$\n$\n$\nReserve adjustments\n(3\n)\nAmounts paid\n(19\n)\n(20\n)\n(20\n)\nAsbestos reserve - end of year (a)\n$\n$\n$\n(a)\tIncluded $18 million classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nHercules asbestos-related receivables\nFor the Hercules asbestos-related obligations, certain reimbursement obligations pursuant to coverage-in-place agreements with insurance carriers exist. As a result, any increases in the asbestos reserve have been partially offset by probable insurance recoveries. Ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on managements interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage, including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent. The estimated receivable consists exclusively of solvent domestic insurers.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the receivables from insurers amounted to $52 million and $47 million, respectively. During 2022, the annual update of the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers was completed. This model update resulted in a $7 million increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries.\nA progression of activity in the Hercules insurance receivable is presented in the following table.\n(In millions)\nInsurance receivable - beginning of year\n$\n$\n$\nReceivable adjustment (a)\n(2\n)\nAmounts collected\n(2\n)\n(1\n)\n-\nInsurance receivable - end of year (b)\n$\n$\n$\n(a)\t2021 includes a $1 million reserve adjustment related to allowances for credit losses as a result of Ashland's adoption of the new credit measurement standard described in Note A. The total allowance for credit losses was $1 million as of September 30,2022.\n(b)\tIncluded $3 million and $1 million classified in accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAsbestos litigation cost projection\nProjecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are difficult to predict. In addition to the uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received, other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant and the related costs incurred in resolving those claims, mortality rates, dismissal rates, uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case. Furthermore, any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. In light of these inherent uncertainties, Ashland believes that the asbestos reserves for Ashland and Hercules represent the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes. As a part of the process to develop these estimates of future asbestos costs, a range of long-term cost models was developed. These models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long-term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs, as well as other variables mentioned previously. Ashland has currently estimated in various models ranging from approximately 40 year periods that it is reasonably possible that total future litigation defense and claim settlement costs on an inflated and undiscounted basis could range as high as approximately $456 million for the Ashland asbestos-related litigation (current reserve of $305 million) and approximately $317 million for the Hercules asbestos-related litigation (current reserve of $213 million), depending on the combination of assumptions selected in the various models. If actual experience is worse than projected, relative to the number of claims filed, the severity of alleged disease associated with those claims or costs incurred to resolve those claims, or actuarial refinement or improvements to the assumptions used within these models are initiated, Ashland may need to further increase the estimates of the costs associated with asbestos claims and these increases could be material over time.\nEnvironmental remediation and asset retirement obligations\nAshland is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts (collectively environmental remediation) at multiple locations. At September 30, 2022, such locations included 76 sites where Ashland has been identified as a potentially responsible party under Superfund or similar state laws, 111 current and former operating facilities and about 1,225 service station properties, of which 17 are being actively remediated.\nAshlands reserves for environmental remediation and related environmental litigation amounted to $211 million at September 30, 2022 compared to $207 million at September 30, 2021, of which $157 million at September 30, 2022 and $152 million at September 30, 2021 were classified in other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining reserves were classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the environmental remediation reserves during 2022 and 2021.\n(In millions)\nEnvironmental remediation reserve - beginning of year\n$\n$\nDisbursements\n(63\n)\n(44\n)\nRevised obligation estimates and accretion\nEnvironmental remediation reserve - end of year\n$\n$\nThe total reserves for environmental remediation reflect Ashlands estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable, without regard to any third-party recoveries. Engineering studies, historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation. Ashland continues to discount certain environmental sites and regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues. Ashland has estimated the value of its probable insurance recoveries associated with its environmental reserve based on managements interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage. At\nSeptember 30, 2022 and 2021, Ashlands recorded receivable for these probable insurance recoveries was $21 million and $16 million, respectively, of which $17 million and $13 million was classified in other noncurrent assets in the respective Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, Ashland recognized $66 million, $50 million and $48 million of expense, respectively, for certain environmental liabilities related to normal ongoing remediation cost estimate updates for sites, which is consistent with Ashlands historical environmental accounting policy.\nComponents of environmental remediation expense included within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) are presented in the following table for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n(In millions)\nEnvironmental expense\n$\n$\n$\nAccretion\nLegal expense\nTotal expense\nInsurance receivable\n(5\n)\n(4\n)\n(6\n)\nTotal expense, net of receivable activity (a)\n$\n$\n$\n(a)\tNet expense of $13 million, $6 million and $12 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to divested businesses which qualified for treatment as discontinued operations and for which certain environmental liabilities were retained by Ashland. These amounts are classified within the income from discontinued operations caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nEnvironmental remediation reserves are subject to uncertainties that affect Ashlands ability to estimate its share of the costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site and the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of environmental remediation, Ashland currently estimates that the upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for identified sites could be as high as approximately $465 million. The largest reserve for any site is 13% of the remediation reserve.\nOther legal proceedings and claims\nIn addition to the matters described above, there are other various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings pending or threatened against Ashland and its current and former subsidiaries. Such actions are with respect to commercial matters, product liability, toxic tort liability, and other environmental matters, which seek remedies or damages, some of which are for substantial amounts. While Ashland cannot predict with certainty the outcome of such actions, it believes that adequate reserves have been recorded and losses already recognized with respect to such actions were immaterial as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. There is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized may be incurred related to these actions; however, Ashland believes that such potential losses were immaterial as of September 30, 2022.\nNOTE O - EQUITY ITEMS\nStock repurchase programs\nOn May 25, 2022, Ashland's board of directors authorized a new, evergreen $500 million common share repurchase program (2022 stock repurchase program). The new authorization terminates and replaces the company's 2018 $1 billion share repurchase program, which had $150 million outstanding at the date of termination. As of September 30, 2022, $500 million remained available for repurchase under the 2022 stock repurchase program.\nStock repurchase program agreements\nIn September 2021, under the 2018 stock repurchase program, Ashland announced that it entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (2021 ASR Agreement). Under the 2021 ASR Agreement, Ashland paid an initial purchase price of $450 million and received an initial delivery of 3.9 million shares of common stock during September 2021. The bank exercised its early termination option under the 2021 ASR Agreement in February 2022, and an additional 0.7 million shares were repurchased, bringing the total shares repurchased upon settlement to 4.6 million.\nOn March 1, 2022, under the 2018 stock repurchase program, Ashland entered into an agreement to repurchase an aggregate amount of $200 million of Ashland common stock using open-market purchases under rule 10b-18. On April 8, 2022, Ashland completed repurchases under this agreement repurchasing a total of 2.15 million shares for a total amount of $200 million.\nStockholder dividends\nAshland paid dividends per common share of $1.27, $1.15 and $1.10 during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nIn May 2022, the Board of Directors of Ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend of 33.5 cents per share to eligible stockholders at record, which represented an increase from the previous quarterly cash dividend of 30.0 cents per share. This dividend was paid in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022.\nIn May 2021, the Board of Directors of Ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend of 30.0 cents per share to eligible stockholders at record, which represented an increase from the previous quarterly cash dividend of 27.5 cents per share. This dividend was paid in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021 and the first and second quarters of fiscal 2022.\nIn May 2019, the Board of Directors of Ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend of 27.5 cents per share to eligible stockholders at record, which represented an increase from the previous quarterly cash dividend of 25.0 cents per share. This dividend was paid in each quarter of fiscal 2020 and the first and second quarters of fiscal 2021.\nShares reserved for issuance\nAt September 30, 2022, 17.6 million common shares were reserved for issuance under stock incentive and deferred compensation plans.\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nComponents of other comprehensive income (loss) recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) are presented in the following table, before tax and net of tax effects.\nTax\nBefore\n(expense)\nNet of\n(In millions)\ntax\nbenefit\ntax\nYear ended September 30, 2022\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nUnrealized translation loss\n$\n(199\n)\n$\n$\n(197\n)\nUnrealized loss on commodity hedges\n(2\n)\n(1\n)\nPension and postretirement obligation adjustment\n-\nTotal other comprehensive gain (loss)\n$\n(200\n)\n$\n$\n(197\n)\nYear ended September 30, 2021\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nUnrealized translation gain\n$\n$\n(1\n)\n$\nUnrealized gain on commodity hedges\n(1\n)\nTotal other comprehensive gain (loss)\n$\n$\n(2\n)\n$\nYear ended September 30, 2020\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nUnrealized translation gain\n$\n$\n(1\n)\n$\nTotal other comprehensive gain (loss)\n$\n$\n(1\n)\n$\nSummary of Stockholders Equity\nA reconciliation of changes in stockholders equity are as follows:\n(In millions)\nCommon stock and paid in capital\nBalance, beginning of period\n$\n$\n$\nCommon shares issued under stock incentive and other plans (a)\nCommon shares purchased under repurchase program (b)\n(200\n)\n(450\n)\n-\nBalance, end of period\nRetained earnings\nBalance, beginning of period\n2,796\n2,649\n3,224\nAdoption of new accounting pronouncements (c)\n-\n(2\n)\n-\nNet income (loss)\n(508\n)\nRegular dividends\n(70\n)\n(71\n)\n(67\n)\nBalance, end of period\n3,653\n2,796\n2,649\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nBalance, beginning of period\n(372\n)\n(383\n)\n(410\n)\nUnrealized translation gain (loss)\n(197\n)\nUnrealized gain (loss) on commodity hedges\n(1\n)\n-\nPension and postretirement obligation adjustment\n-\n-\nBalance, end of period\n(569\n)\n(372\n)\n(383\n)\nTotal stockholders' equity\n$\n3,220\n$\n2,752\n$\n3,036\nCash dividends declared per common share\n$\n1.27\n$\n1.15\n$\n1.10\n(a)\tCommon shares issued were 168,270, 183,281 and 391,180 for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(b)\tCommon shares repurchased were 2,853,312 and 3,922,423 for 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(c)\tRepresents the cumulative-effect adjustment related to the adoption of the new guidance related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments during fiscal 2021. See Note A for more information.\nNOTE P - STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS\nAshland has stock incentive plans under which key employees or directors are granted performance share awards or nonvested stock awards. Each program is typically a long-term incentive plan designed to link employee compensation with increased shareholder value or reward superior performance and encourage continued employment with Ashland. Ashland recognizes compensation expense for the grant date fair value of stock-based awards over the applicable vesting period and accounts for forfeitures when they occur across all stock-based awards.\nThe components of Ashland's pretax compensation expense for stock-based awards (net of forfeitures) and associated income tax benefits are as follows.\n(In millions)\n2022 (a)\n2021 (b)\n2020 (c)\nSARs\n$\n$\n$\nNonvested stock awards\nPerformance share awards\n$\n$\n$\nIncome tax benefit\n$\n$\n$\n(a)\tThe year ended September 30, 2022 included $4 million and $2 million of expense related to cash-settled nonvested restricted stock awards and cash-settled performance units, respectively.\n(b)\tThe year ended September 30, 2021 included $3 million and zero of expense related to cash-settled nonvested restricted stock awards and cash-settled performance units, respectively.\n(c)\tThe year ended September 30, 2020 included $2 million and zero of expense related to cash-settled nonvested restricted stock awards and cash-settled performance units, respectively.\nStock Appreciation Rights\nSARs were granted to employees or directors at a price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and typically become exercisable over periods of one to three years. Unexercised SARs lapse ten years after the date of grant. Ashland estimates the fair value of SARs granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires several assumptions, which Ashland has developed and updates based on historical trends and current market observations. The accuracy of these assumptions is critical to the estimate of fair value for these equity instruments. The following table illustrates the weighted-average of key assumptions used within the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The risk-free interest rate assumption was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant for the expected term of the instrument. The dividend yield reflects the assumption that the current dividend payout will continue with no anticipated increases. The volatility assumption was calculated by utilizing peer companies because historical volatility was not considered reflective of future volatility given the divestitures discussed in Notes C and D. The expected life is based on the mid-point of the weighted average time to vest and contractual term. Ashland did not grant any SARs during 2022 or 2021.\n(In millions except per share data)\nWeighted-average fair value per share of SARs granted\n$\n16.15\nAssumptions (weighted-average)\nRisk-free interest rate\n1.7\n%\nExpected dividend yield\n1.4\n%\nExpected volatility\n23.0\n%\nExpected life (in years)\nA progression of activity and various other information relative to SARs and previously issued and vested stock options is presented in the following table.\nNumber\nWeighted-\nNumber\nWeighted-\nNumber\nWeighted-\nof\naverage\nof\naverage\nof\naverage\n(In thousands except per\ncommon\nexercise price\ncommon\nexercise price\ncommon\nexercise price\nshare data)\nshares\nper share\nshares\nper share\nshares\nper share\nOutstanding - beginning of year\n1,543\n$\n62.14\n1,993\n$\n61.11\n2,102\n$\n57.94\nGranted\n-\n-\n-\n-\n77.58\nExercised\n(392\n)\n57.32\n(386\n)\n54.44\n(271\n)\n46.00\nForfeitures and expirations\n(9\n)\n54.70\n(64\n)\n77.17\n(152\n)\n78.27\nOutstanding - end of year (a)\n1,142\n63.85\n1,543\n62.14\n1,993\n61.11\nExercisable - end of year\n1,094\n63.24\n1,415\n60.68\n1,609\n57.31\n(a)\tExercise prices per share for SARs outstanding at September 30, 2022 ranged from $37.37 to $47.63 for 101 thousand shares, from $57.96 to $59.95 for 523 thousand shares, and from $67.16 to $82.34 for 518 thousand shares. The weighted-average remaining contractual life of outstanding SARs was 4.5 years and exercisable SARs and stock options was 4.3 years\nThe total intrinsic value of SARs exercised was $19 million in 2022, $12 million in 2021 and $8 million in 2020. The actual tax benefit realized from the exercised SARs was $4 million in 2022, $3 million in 2021 and $2 million in 2020. The total grant date fair value of SARs that vested during 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $1 million, $1 million and $4 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, there was less than $1 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to SARs. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.3 years. As of September 30, 2022, the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding SARs and exercisable SARs was $36 million and $35 million, respectively.\nNonvested stock awards\nNonvested stock awards are granted to employees or directors at a price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and generally vest over a one-to-three-year period. However, such shares or units are subject to forfeiture upon termination of service before the vesting period ends. Beginning in 2016, these awards were primarily granted as stock units that will convert to shares upon vesting, while the grants in prior years were generally made in nonvested shares. Only nonvested stock awards granted in the form of shares entitle employees or directors to vote the shares. Dividends on nonvested stock awards granted are in the form of additional units or shares of nonvested stock awards, which are subject to vesting and forfeiture provisions.\nA progression of activity and various other information relative to nonvested stock awards is presented in the following table.\nNumber\nWeighted-\nNumber\nWeighted-\nNumber\nWeighted-\nof\naverage\nof\naverage\nof\naverage\n(In thousands except per\ncommon\ngrant date\ncommon\ngrant date\ncommon\ngrant date\nshare data)\nshares\nfair value\nshares\nfair value\nshares\nfair value\nNonvested - beginning of year\n$\n76.10\n$\n74.57\n$\n73.26\nGranted\n92.34\n78.96\n75.42\nVested\n(72\n)\n78.81\n(69\n)\n75.10\n(125\n)\n72.43\nForfeitures\n(10\n)\n80.06\n(12\n)\n79.02\n(31\n)\n77.99\nNonvested - end of year\n82.55\n76.10\n74.57\nThe total grant date fair value of nonvested stock awards that vested during 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $6 million, $5 million and $9 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, there was $6 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested stock awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years.\nCash-settled nonvested stock awards\nCertain nonvested stock awards are granted to employees and are settled in cash upon vesting. As of September 30, 2022, 76 thousand cash-settled nonvested stock awards were outstanding. The value of these cash-settled nonvested stock awards changes in connection with changes in the fair market value of the Ashland Common Stock. These awards generally vest over a period of three years. The expense recognized related to cash-settled nonvested stock awards was $6 million, $3 million, and $2 million during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nPerformance awards\nAshland sponsors a long-term incentive plan that awards performance shares/units to certain key employees that are tied to Ashlands overall financial performance relative to the financial performance of selected industry peer groups and/or internal targets. Awards are granted annually, with each award covering a three-year vesting period. Nonvested performance shares/units do not entitle employees to vote the shares or to receive any dividends thereon.\nEach awarded performance share is convertible to one share of Ashland Common Stock and recorded as a component of stockholders equity. Performance measures used to determine the actual number of performance shares issuable upon vesting includes 60:40 weighting of Ashlands total shareholder return (TSR) performance and Ashlands return on net assets (RONA) performance as compared to internal targets. TSR relative to peers is considered a market condition while RONA is considered a performance condition in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following table shows the performance shares/units granted for all plans that award Ashland Common Stock.\nWeighted-\nTarget\naverage\nshares/units\nfair value per\n(In thousands)\nVesting period\ngranted (a)\nshare/unit (a)\nFiscal Year 2022\nOctober 1, 2021 - September 30, 2024\n$\n131.33\nFiscal Year 2021\nOctober 1, 2020 - September 30, 2023\n$\n90.44\nFiscal Year 2020\nOctober 1, 2019 - September 30, 2022\n$\n88.65\n(a)\tAt the end of the performance period, the actual number of shares/units awarded can range from zero to 200% of the target shares/units granted, which is assumed to be 100%.

Ashlands trade receivables were $369 million and $308 million as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. See Note I for additional information on Ashland's program to sell certain receivables on a revolving basis to third party banks up to an aggregate purchase limit.\nDisaggregation of revenue\nAshland disaggregates its revenue from contracts with customers by segment and geographical region, as Ashland believes these categories best depict how management reviews the financial performance of its operations for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Ashland includes only U.S. and Canada in its North America designation and includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa in its Europe designation. See the following tables for details (Intersegment sales eliminations have been excluded.

Operating income and EBITDA are the primary measures of performance that are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in assessing each reportable segment's financial performance. Ashland does not aggregate operating segments to arrive at these reportable segments.\nChange in reportable segments\nOn February 28, 2022, Ashland completed the sale of its Performance Adhesives segment. The operating results and cash flows for the Performance Adhesives segment have been classified as discontinued operations within the Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented. As a result, Ashlands reportable segments include Life Sciences, Personal Care, Specialty Additives, and Intermediates.\nUnallocated and Other includes corporate governance activities and certain legacy matters.

The structure is specific to Ashland; therefore, the financial results of Ashlands reportable segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other comparable companies. Ashland allocates all costs to its reportable segments except for certain significant company-wide restructuring activities, certain corporate governance costs and other costs or activities that relate to former businesses that Ashland no longer operates. The service cost component of pension and other postretirement benefits costs is allocated to each reportable segment on a ratable basis; while the remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits costs are recorded within the other net periodic benefit income (loss) caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (loss). Ashland refines its expense allocation methodologies to the reportable segments from time to time as internal accounting practices are improved, more refined information becomes available and the industry or market changes. Significant revisions to Ashlands methodologies are adjusted for all segments on a retrospective basis. This includes changes in prior years for indirect corporate costs previously allocated to Performance Adhesives. These costs are now reflected in Unallocated and Other for all periods presented.\nAshland determined that disclosing sales by specific product was impracticable due to the highly customized and extensive portfolio of products offered to customers and since no one product or a small group of products could be aggregated together to represent a majority of revenue within a reportable segment.\nThe following table presents various financial information for each reportable segment for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nAshland Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries\nReportable Segment Information\nYears Ended September 30\n(In millions)\nSales\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\n$\nPersonal Care\nSpecialty Additives\nIntermediates\nIntersegment sales (a)\n(77\n)\n(51\n)\n(25\n)\n$\n2,391\n$\n2,111\n$\n2,016\nEquity income\nLife Sciences\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nPersonal Care\n-\n-\nSpecialty Additives\n-\n-\n-\nIntermediates\n-\n-\n-\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\nOther income (expense)\nLife Sciences\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\nPersonal Care\n-\n-\nSpecialty Additives\n-\n-\nIntermediates\n-\n-\n-\nUnallocated and Other\n$\n$\n$\nEquity and other income\n$\n$\n$\nOperating income (loss)\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\n$\nPersonal Care (b)\n(296\n)\nSpecialty Additives (b)\n(132\n)\nIntermediates\n(10\n)\nUnallocated and Other (b)\n(114\n)\n(107\n)\n(146\n)\n$\n$\n$\n(461\n)\n(In millions)\nDepreciation expense\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\n$\nPersonal Care\nSpecialty Additives\nIntermediates\nUnallocated and Other\n-\n$\n$\n$\nAmortization expense\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\n$\nPersonal Care\nSpecialty Additives\nIntermediates\nUnallocated and Other\n-\n-\n$\n$\n$\nEBITDA (c)\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\n$\nPersonal Care\n(219\n)\nSpecialty Additives\n(51\n)\nIntermediates\nUnallocated and Other\n(114\n)\n(106\n)\n(143\n)\n$\n$\n$\n(226\n)\nAdditions to property, plant and equipment\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\n$\nPersonal Care\nSpecialty Additives\nIntermediates\nUnallocated and Other\n$\n$\n$\n(In millions)\nAssets\nLife Sciences\n$\n1,905\n$\n1,945\nPersonal Care (d)\n1,073\n1,145\nSpecialty Additives\n1,567\n1,636\nIntermediates\nUnallocated and Other (e)\n1,498\n1,726\n$\n6,213\n$\n6,612\nProperty, plant and equipment - net\nLife Sciences\n$\n$\nPersonal Care\nSpecialty Additives\nIntermediates\nUnallocated and Other\n$\n1,338\n$\n1,427\n(a)Intersegment sales from Intermediates are accounted for at prices that approximate fair value.
