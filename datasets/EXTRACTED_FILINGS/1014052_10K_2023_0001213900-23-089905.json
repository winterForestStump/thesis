    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS.\nOverview\nDigerati Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (including our subsidiaries, we, us, Company or Digerati), through its operating subsidiaries, (i) Verve Cloud, Inc. (formerly known as T3 communications, Inc.), a Nevada corporation (Verve Cloud Nevada), (ii) Verve Cloud, Inc. (formerly known as Shift8 Networks, Inc.), a Texas corporation (Verve Cloud Texas), (iii) T3 Communications, Inc., a Florida corporation (T3 Communications), (iv) Nexogy, Inc., a Florida corporation (Nexogy) and (v) NextLevel Internet, Inc., a California corporation (Next Level and, together with Verve Cloud Nevada, Verve Cloud Texas, T3 Communications and Nexogy, the Operating Subsidiaries)., which, as of June 1, 2023, operate as a single business unit under the Verve Cloud name and have locations in Texas, Florida and California, provides cloud services specializing in Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) and broadband connectivity solutions for the business market. Our product line includes a portfolio of Internet-based telephony products and services delivered through our cloud application platform and session-based communication network and network services including Internet broadband, fiber, mobile broadband, and cloud Wide Area Network (WAN) or Software-defined Wide Area Network (SD WAN) solutions. Digerati Technologies, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada in 1994.\nWe provide enterprise-class, carrier-grade services to the small-to-medium-sized business (SMB) at cost-effective monthly rates. Our UCaaS or cloud communication services include fully hosted Internet Protocol (IP)/private branch exchange (PBX), video conferencing, mobile applications, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) transport, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunking, and customized VoIP services all delivered Only in the Cloud\u2122. Our broadband connectivity solutions for the delivery of digital oxygen are designed for reliability, business continuity and to optimize bandwidth for businesses using the Companys cloud communication services and other cloud-based applications.\nAs a provider of cloud communications solutions to the SMB, we are seeking to capitalize on the migration by businesses from the legacy telephone network to the IP telecommunication network and the migration from hardware-based on-premise telephone systems to software-based communication systems in the cloud. Most SMBs are lagging in technical capabilities and advancement and seldom reach the economies of scale that their larger counterparts enjoy, due to their achievement of a critical mass and ability to deploy a single solution to a large number of workers. SMBs are typically unable to afford comprehensive enterprise solutions and, therefore, need to integrate a combination of business solutions to meet their needs. Cloud computing has revolutionized the industry and opened the door for businesses of all sizes to gain access to enterprise applications with affordable pricing. This especially holds true for cloud telephony applications, but SMBs are still a higher-touch sale that requires customer support for system integration, network installation, cabling, and troubleshooting. We have placed a significant emphasis on that local touch when selling, delivering, and supporting our services which we believe will differentiate us from the national providers that are experiencing high attrition rates due to poor customer support.\nThe adoption of cloud communication services is being driven by the convergence of several market trends, including the increasing costs of maintaining installed legacy communications systems, the fragmentation resulting from use of multiple on-premise systems, and the proliferation of personal smartphones used in the workplace. Today, businesses are increasingly looking for an affordable path to modernizing their communications system to improve productivity, business performance and customer experience. Modernization has also led to businesses adopting other cloud-based business applications, including customer relationship management (CRM), payroll, and accounting software, placing an even more important emphasis on reliable Internet connectivity.\nOur cloud solutions offer the SMB reliable, robust, and full-featured services at affordable monthly rates that eliminates high-cost capital expenditures and provides for integration with other cloud-based systems. By providing a variety of comprehensive and scalable solutions, we can cater to businesses of different sizes on a monthly subscription basis, regardless of the stage of development for the business.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisitions\nOn February 4, 2022, the Company closed on the acquisition of Next Level Internet, Inc. (NextLevel). NextLevel, based in San Diego, California, is engaged in the business of providing cloud communications, UCaaS, collaboration, contact center, managed broadband connectivity and other voice and data services to the SMB market. The acquisition of NextLevel expands the Companys growing nationwide footprint and adds a strong West Coast presence with nearly 1,000 SMB clients in California.\nOn December 31, 2021, the Company closed on the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Skynet Telecom LLC (Skynet), a Texas-based provider of VoIP communication services, UCaaS, and broadband connectivity services to the SMB market. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired the customer base, certain equipment, certain intellectual property, inventory, contract rights, software and other licenses, and miscellaneous assets used in connection with the operation of Skynets telecommunications business.\nTermination of Minority Equality Opportunities Acquisition Inc., (MEOA) Business Combination\nOn August 30, 2022, Digerati entered into a Business Combination Agreement (as amended, supplemented and otherwise modified from time to time, the Business Combination Agreement), by and among Digerati, MEOA, a Delaware corporation, and Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of MEOA (Merger Sub).\nThe Business Combination Agreement provided, among other things, that Merger Sub was to merge with and into Digerati, with Digerati as the surviving company in the merger and, after giving effect to such merger, Digerati being a wholly-owned subsidiary of MEOA (the Merger). In addition, MEOA was to be renamed Verve Technologies Corporation. In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Business Combination Agreement, at the closing, among other things, each share of Digerati common stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the closing was to be exchanged for shares of MEOA common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, based upon the exchange ratio set forth in the Business Combination Agreement.\nOn June 15, 2023, Digerati terminated the Business Combination Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d) of the Business Combination Agreement because the transaction did not close on or prior to the June 15, 2023 termination date. On May 24, 2023, The Nasdaq Stock Market halted the trading MEOA securities. Following this halt, the parties to the Business Combination Agreement did not obtain, prior to June 15, 2023, Nasdaqs approval of the initial listing application for the combined company in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement.\nAs of July 31, 2023, neither party has sought a termination fee pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement.\nProducts and Services\nWe provide a comprehensive suite of cloud services specializing in UCaaS solutions for the business market. Our product line includes a portfolio of Internet-based telephony products and services delivered through our cloud application platform and session-based communication network and network services including Internet broadband, fiber, mobile broadband, and cloud WAN or SD-WAN solutions. We provide enterprise-class, carrier-grade services to the SMB at cost-effective monthly rates. Our UCaaS or cloud communication services include fully hosted IP/PBX, video conferencing, mobile applications, VoIP transport, SIP trunking, and customized VoIP services all delivered Only in the Cloud\u2122. Our broadband connectivity solutions for the delivery of digital oxygen are designed for reliability, business continuity and to optimize bandwidth for businesses using the Companys cloud communication services and other cloud-based applications.\nVoice over Internet Protocol Networks\nThe basic technology of traditional telecommunications systems was designed for slow mechanical switches. Communications over the traditional telephone network are routed through circuits that must dedicate all circuit resources to each call from its inception until the call ends, regardless of whether anyone is actually talking on the circuit. This circuit-switching technology incurs a significant cost per call and does not efficiently support the integration of voice with data services. Data networks, however, were designed for electronic switching. They break the data stream into small, individually addressed packages of data (packets) that are routed independently of each other from the origin to the destination. Therefore, data networks do not require a fixed amount of bandwidth to be reserved between the origin and destination of each call and they do not waste bandwidth when it is not being used for actual transmission of information. This allows multiple voice or voice and data calls to be pooled, resulting in these networks being able to carry more calls with an equal amount of bandwidth. Moreover, they do not require the same complex switching methods required by traditional voice telephone networks, instead using a multiplicity of routers to direct each packet to its destination and automatically routing packets around blockages, congestion, or outages.\nPacket switching can be used within a data network or across networks, including the public Internet. The Internet itself is not a single data network owned by any single entity, but rather a loose interconnection of networks belonging to many owners that communicate using the IP. By converting voice signals to digital data and handling the voice signals as data, it can be transmitted through the more efficient switching networks designed for data transmissions and through the Internet using the IP. The transmission of voice signals as digitalized data streams over the Internet is known as VoIP. A VoIP network has the following advantages over traditional networks:\n\u25cf Simplification: An integrated infrastructure that supports all forms of communication allows more standardization, a smaller equipment complement, and less equipment management.\n\u25cf Network Efficiency: The integration of voice and data fills up the data communication channels efficiently, thus providing bandwidth consolidation and reduction of the costs associated with idle bandwidth. This combined infrastructure can support dynamic bandwidth optimization and a fault tolerant design. The differences between the traffic patterns of voice and data offer further opportunities for significant efficiency improvements.\n\u25cf Co-existence with traditional communication mediums: IP telephony can be used in conjunction with existing public telephone system switches, leased and dial-up lines, PBXs and other customer premise equipment, enterprise local area networks (LANs), and Internet connections. IP telephony applications can be implemented through dedicated gateways, which in turn can be based on open standards platforms for reliability and scalability.\n\u25cf Cost reduction: Under the VoIP network, the connection is directly to the Internet backbone and as a result the telephony access charges, and settlement fees are avoided.\nThe growth of voice over the Internet was limited in the past due to poor sound quality caused by technical issues such as delays in packet transmission and by bandwidth limitations related to Internet network capacity and local access constraints. However, the expansion of IP network infrastructure, improvements in packet switching and compression technology, new software algorithms and improved hardware have substantially reduced delays in packet transmissions and resulted in superior sound quality to that of the legacy telephone network. The continued improvement and expansion of the Internet Protocol network has resulted in the use of this technology for other communication media, including video conferencing and instant messaging.\nCloud Communications\nCloud communications are Internet-based voice and data communications where telecommunications applications, switching and storage are hosted by a third-party service provider outside of the organization using the services. Services are accessed by the user over the public Internet. Cloud telephony refers specifically to voice services and more specifically the replacement of conventional business telephone equipment (such as a PBX) with VoIP service hosted by a third-party service provider and delivered over the Internet.\nWe operate a cloud communication network that consists of a VoIP switching system and cloud telephony application platform. Our network allows us to provide end-to-end cloud telephony solutions designed to provide significant benefits to businesses of all sizes, with single or multiple locations. The integration of our cloud communication platform and global VoIP network allows us to provide our customers with virtually any type of telephony solution, including video conferencing, on a global basis.\nOur cloud communication solutions, also known as UCaaS, are designed to minimize upfront capital costs, increase the scalability and flexibility of the customers communications network and service environment, provide robust features and functionality to increase productivity and reduce the overall cost of communications.\nBroadband Connectivity\nBroadband connectivity or Internet access is the ability of individuals and organizations to connect to the Internet using computer terminals, computers, and other devices and to access services or applications hosted on the Internet or in the cloud. Internet service providers (ISPs) deliver connectivity at a wide range of data transfer rates using various networking technologies.\nWe operate as an ISP in California and Florida through a broadband network engineered and built to deliver broadband solutions to our customers in the regional markets served by the Company. The Companys broadband network utilizes various network technologies, including fiber and wireless technology. Our IP layer of the ISP network incorporates SD WAN technology for optimization of bandwidth and business continuity. The Company also deploys mobile broadband solutions to serve as a diverse network back-up for Internet connectivity.\nStrategy\nOur strategy is to target the small to medium-sized business market and capitalize on the wave of migration from the legacy telephone network to cloud telephony. We will continue to concentrate our sales and marketing efforts on developing vertically oriented solutions for targeted markets primarily focusing on municipalities, banking, healthcare, legal services, and real estate. In addition, we will continue to partner with our distributors and Value-Added Resellers (VARs) to expand our customer base. Our typical VAR, also referred to as a Partner, is an information technology services firm, traditional PBX vendor, managed service provider, or systems integrator that has established relationships with businesses in its local market. These VARs are currently providing local customer support for other IT or PBX services but lack the technology infrastructure to provide cloud communication and VoIP services to their customers. Our strategy allows these VARs to focus on their strength of providing first tier support to their customers while we provide the second and third tier technical support required to operate a cloud communication and VoIP network. In addition, we transform our VARs business model by introducing new cloud telephony services and adding a new and lucrative recurring revenue stream that increases the VARs value proposition for its current and prospective customers.\nOur cloud-based technology platform enables us and our VARs to deliver enhanced voice services to their business customers. The features supported on our cloud communication platform include all standard telephone features and value-added applications such as voicemail to email, VoIP peering, teleconferencing, interactive voice response (IVR) auto attendant, and dial-by-name directory. Our system provides our customers and VARs with a migration path from a traditional PBX system to a complete cloud-based PBX solution.\nOur strategic initiatives to successfully meet our long-term business objectives include:\n\u25cf A continued emphasis on our UCaaS/cloud communication business, which operates in a segment of the telecommunications industry that continues to experience solid growth as businesses migrate from legacy phone systems to cloud-based telephony systems and implement hybrid \u2018stay at home teleworking environments.\n\u25cf Enhancements to our UCaaS solutions to include collaboration tools and integration with third-party systems that improves our business customers internal communication and engagement with underlying customers.\n\u25cf Continued enhancements to our broadband product portfolio and the delivery of digital oxygen to our business customers.\n\u25cf A disciplined approach to evaluating additional accretive acquisitions as we continue to target local and/or regional UCaaS/cloud telephony providers, which have excelled in their market with that local touch when serving their business customers. The Company will assimilate best practices from its acquisitions to optimize productivity and performance throughout the organization.\n\u25cf A continued focus on the U.S. market of SMBs, of which a significant portion has not yet migrated to a UCaaS or cloud communication solution.\n\u25cf A continued emphasis on the Companys channel strategy that enables its agents and Partners to offer cloud and session-based communication services to the business market, primarily the SMB.\n\u25cf Continued enhancement of our infrastructure and back-office systems to streamline operations and automate processes for efficiency, all which support both its organic and acquisition growth model.\n\u25cf Implementing a total support model (pre and post sales) for building a world-class service delivery and help desk organization.\nCompetitive Conditions\nThe cloud services industry, including the provisioning of cloud communications services, cloud connectivity, cloud storage and cloud computing, as well as carrier voice and data services, is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to constant technological change and intense marketing by providers with similar products and services. We expect that new, smaller, but very agile competitors, specializing in providing service to regional and emerging markets at low margin and hence low cost, may have an impact on our market. Similarly, the business services market includes competitors who may be significantly larger and have substantially greater market presence, financial, technical, operational and marketing resources than we do, including Tier 1 carriers, cable companies and premise-based solutions providers that are implementing cloud communication services. In the event that such a competitor expends significant sales and marketing resources in one or several markets where we compete with them, we may not be able to compete successfully in those markets. Specialized cloud services providers, who focus on one or more cloud service or application, could adopt aggressive pricing and promotion practices that could impact our ability to compete. We also believe that competition will continue to increase, placing downward pressure on prices. Such pressure could adversely affect our gross margins if we are not able to reduce our costs commensurate with the price reductions of our competitors. In addition, the pace of technological change makes it impossible for us to predict whether we will face new competitors using different technologies to provide the same or similar services offered or proposed to be offered by us. If our competitors were to provide better and more cost-effective services than ours, we may not be able to increase our revenues or capture any significant market share.\nThe VoIP and Internet telephony market are highly competitive. Our competitors include major telecommunications carriers in the U.S., national UCaaS providers, and numerous small cloud telephony operators. We expect to face continuing competition based on price and service offerings from existing competitors and new market entrants in the future. The principal competitive factors in our market include price, coverage, customer service, technical response times, reliability, and network size/capacity. The competitive landscape is rapidly altering the number, identity, and competitiveness of the marketplace, and we are unable to determine with certainty the impact of potential consolidation in our industry.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we have. As a result, certain of these competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies that could hinder our ability to market our services. We believe that our key competitive advantages are our ability to deliver reliable, high quality voice service over the Internet in a cost-effective manner, superior customers service and our VAR distribution model. We cannot provide assurances, however, that these advantages will enable us to succeed against comparable service offerings from our competitors.\nGovernment Regulation\nAs a provider of Internet voice communications services, we are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Some of these regulatory obligations include contributing to the Federal Universal Service Fund, Telecommunications Relay Service Fund and federal programs related to number administration; providing access to E-911 services; protecting customer information; and porting phone numbers upon a valid customer request, and complying with rules to mitigate Robocalls under the Pallone-Thune Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act, FCCs Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR)/Signature-based Handling of Asserted Information Using toKENs (SHAKEN) protocols, and any response to Traceback requests from the FCCs industry consortium- Industry Traceback Group. We are also required to pay state and local 911 fees and contribute to state universal service funds in those states that assess Internet voice communications services. We are a competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) in Florida. We are subject to the same FCC regulations applicable to telecommunications companies, as well as regulation by the public utility commission in these states. Specific regulations vary on a state-by-state basis, but generally include the requirement to register or seek certification to provide telephone services, to file and update tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions, and prices for our intrastate services and to comply with various reporting, record-keeping, surcharge collection, and consumer protection requirements.\nThe effect of any future laws, regulations, and orders on our operations, including, but not limited to, our cloud-based communications and collaboration services, cannot be determined. But as a general matter, increased regulation and the imposition of additional funding obligations increases service costs that may or may not be recoverable from our customers, which could result in making our services less competitive with traditional telecommunications services if we increase our prices or decreasing our profit margins if we attempt to absorb such costs.\nFederal, state, local, and foreign governmental organizations are considering other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate and/or tax applications running over the Internet. We cannot predict whether new taxes will be imposed on our services, and depending on the type of taxes imposed, whether and how our services would be affected thereafter. Increased regulation of the Internet may decrease its growth and hinder technological development, which may negatively impact the cost of doing business via the Internet or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRegulation of Internet-based Telecommunication Services in the United States\nWe have the necessary authority under Section 214 of the Communications Act to operate as a domestic and international telecommunications carrier. We are considered a non-dominant domestic interstate carrier subject to minimal regulation by the FCC. We are not required to obtain FCC authority to initiate or expand our domestic interstate operations, but we are required to obtain FCC approval to transfer control or discontinue service and are required to file various reports and pay various fees and assessments. In addition, we must offer service on a non-discriminatory basis at just and reasonable rates and are subject to the FCCs complaint jurisdiction. Generally, our international voice traffic is subject to minimal regulation by state and local jurisdictions.\nAs a CLEC in Florida. We are subject to the same FCC regulations applicable to telecommunications companies, as well as regulation by the public utility commission in Florida. As a CLEC, we are generally required to register or seek certification to provide certain services, to file and update tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions and prices for our intrastate services and to comply with various consumer protection, reporting, record-keeping, surcharge collection requirements.\nThe FCC requires Internet voice communications service providers, such as our company, to provide E-911 service in all geographic areas covered by the traditional wire-line E-911 network. Under the FCCs rules, Internet voice communications providers must transmit the callers phone number and registered location information to the appropriate public safety answering point, or PSAP, for the callers registered location. The FCC also requires interconnected VoIP service providers to make Universal Service Fund (USF) contributions. We believe that our services are currently compliant with all applicable requirements of the FCC, and we have made and are making the required contributions to the USF. However, should we at some time fail to meet certain requirements or fail to make required contributions, we could be subject to revocation of our authority to operate or to fines or penalties.\nAs a result of the FCCs preemption of states ability to regulate certain aspects of VoIP service, and a trend in state legislatures to affirmatively deregulate VoIP services for most purposes, our VoIP services are subject to relatively few state regulatory requirements, aside from collection of state and local E911 fees and state Universal Service support obligations as well as some state communication service and sales taxes, when applicable. We believe that our VoIP services are currently compliant with all applicable state requirements, and we have made and are making the required contributions to E911, state USF, and other funds. The state regulatory framework for our VoIP services continues to evolve, so we, in conjunction with our professional advisors, monitor the actions of the various state regulatory agencies and endeavor to ensure that we are in compliance with applicable state law, including any new statutes or regulations that may be passed. However, there can be no assurance that we will become aware of all applicable requirements on a timely basis, or that we will always be fully compliant with applicable rules and regulations. Should we fail to be compliant with applicable state regulations, or to file required reports with state regulatory agencies, we could be subject to fines and/or penalties.\nIn addition to regulations addressing Internet telephony and broadband services, other regulatory issues relating to the Internet generally could affect our ability to provide our services. Congress has adopted legislation that regulates certain aspects of the Internet including online content, user privacy, taxation, liability for third-party activities and jurisdiction. In addition, a number of initiatives pending in Congress and state legislatures would prohibit or restrict advertising or sale of certain products and services on the Internet, which may have the effect of raising the cost of doing business on the Internet generally.\nInternational Regulation\nThe regulatory treatment of Internet telephony outside of the U.S. varies widely from country to country. A number of countries that currently prohibit competition in the provision of voice telephony also prohibit Internet telephony. Other countries permit but regulate Internet telephony. Some countries will evaluate proposed Internet telephony service on a case-by-case basis and determine whether it should be regulated as a voice service or as another telecommunications service. In many countries, Internet telephony has not yet been addressed by legislation or regulation. Increased regulation of the Internet and/or Internet telephony providers or the prohibition of Internet telephony in one or more countries could adversely affect our business and future prospects if we decide to expand globally.\nFederal Robocall Mitigation Efforts and Regulations\nBeginning in March 2020, the FCC began to implement rules pursuant to the TRACED Act to mitigate illegal and fraudulent robocalls to consumer subscribers. The rules apply to all IP Enabled Communication Services operating in the U.S., including interconnected VoIP services like our services. The FCC also implemented a STIR/SHAKEN caller ID authentication framework be integrated by all VoIP services which requires certain identification processes in their Internet Protocol networks no later than June 30, 2022. We took action to implement STIR/SHAKEN in advance of the FCCs deadlines and are compliant with all applicable STIR/SHAKEN requirements and TRACED Act requirements. We have also registered and coordinated with the FCCs delegated industry consortium for tracking of robocalls through its Industry Traceback Group and stand ready should action be required. The FCC continues to adopt rules related to illegal robocalls, and we continue to monitor the FCC efforts as they further develop in order to ensure continued compliance with robocall mitigation rules.\nCustomers and Suppliers\nWe rely on various suppliers to provide services in connection with our VoIP and UCaaS offerings. Our customers include businesses in various industries including Healthcare, Banking, Financial Services, Legal, Real Estate, and Construction. We are not dependent upon any single supplier or customer.\nDuring the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not derive revenues of 10% or more from any single customer.\nAs of July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not have outstanding accounts receivable of 10% or more from any single customer.\nEmployees\nAs of July 31, 2023, we had 78 full-time total employees. All of our employees performed sales, operational, technical, and administrative functions. We believe our future success will depend to a large extent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified employees. We consider our employee relations to be good. None of these aforementioned employees belong to labor unions. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nNot applicable to smaller reporting companies. ITEM 1B.

None of the securities were sold through an underwriter and accordingly, there were no underwriting discounts or commissions involved. ITEM 6. [RESERVED] ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements describe managements beliefs and expectations about the future. We have identified forward-looking statements by using words such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, may, expect, and intend, or words of similar import. Although we believe these expectations are reasonable, our operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may be materially different than our expectations. Factors that would cause or contribute to such differences include, actions by significant customers or competitors, reliance on key customers and lack of new customer business, continued acceptance of the Companys products in the marketplace, lack of new products, innovation, and technological changes, competitive developments, general domestic and International economic conditions such as inflation and rising interest rates, the Companys past due promissory notes (including receipt of default notices, lack of liquidity, our current going concern, the medical leave of absence of Mr. Art Smith (our CEO), and the decreased availability of capital. The factors listed above are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Form 10-K include additional factors that could materially and adversely impact the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the Company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict the impact of all these factors on the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Any or all of the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K and any other public statement made by the Company or its management may turn out to be incorrect. The Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nThe following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023, and 2022, and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, the Notes thereto, and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For purposes of the following discussion, FY 2023 or 2023 refers to the year ended July 31, 2023, and FY 2022 or 2022 refers to the year ended July 31, 2022.\nRecent Activity\nTermination of MEOA Business Combination\nOn August 30, 2022, Digerati entered into a Business Combination Agreement, by and among Digerati, MEOA, and Merger Sub.\nThe Business Combination Agreement provided, among other things, that Merger Sub was to merge with and into Digerati, with Digerati as the surviving company in the merger and, after giving effect to such merger, Digerati being a wholly-owned subsidiary of MEOA. In addition, MEOA was to be renamed Verve Technologies Corporation. In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Business Combination Agreement, at the closing, among other things, each share of Digerati common stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the closing was to be exchanged for shares of MEOA common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, based upon the exchange ratio set forth in the Business Combination Agreement.\nOn June 15, 2023, Digerati terminated the Business Combination Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d) of the Business Combination Agreement because the transaction did not close on or prior to the June 15, 2023 termination date. On May 24, 2023, The Nasdaq Stock Market halted the trading of MEOA securities. Following this halt, the parties to the Business Combination Agreement did not obtain, prior to June 15, 2023, Nasdaqs approval of the initial listing application for the combined company in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement.\nAs of July 31, 2023, neither party has sought a termination fee pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement.\nResults of Operations\nCloud Software and Service Revenue. Cloud software and service revenue increased by $7,469,000, or 31%, from the year ended July 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2023. The increase in revenue is primarily attributed to the increase in total customers between periods due to the acquisitions of Skynet in December 2021 and of Next Level Internet in February 2022. Our total number of customers increased from 4,023 for the year ended July 31, 2022 to 4,671 customers for the year ended July 31, 2023. As part of the acquisitions, our primary emphasis is on integrating the secured customers base, consolidating products and services, retaining the monthly recuring revenue, and providing exceptional customer support.\nCost of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). The cost of services increased by $1,940,000, or 21%, from the year ended July 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2023. Our total number of customers increased from 4,023 for the year ended July 31, 2022 to 4,671 customers for the year ended July 31, 2023. Our consolidated gross margin improved by $5,529,000, or 37%, from the year ended July 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2023. We are not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to cause a material change in the relationship between our costs and our revenues.\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses (exclusive of legal and professional fees and stock compensation expense). SG&A expenses increased by $4,744,000, or 39%, from the year ended July 31, 2022 as compared to year ended July 31, 2023. The increase in SG&A is attributed to the acquisition of Skynet in December 2021 and the acquisition of Next Level Internet in February 2022; the Company absorbed all of the employees responsible for service delivery for the customer base, technical support, sales, customer service, and administration.\nStock Compensation expense. Stock compensation expenses increased by $657,000, or 293%, from the year ended July 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2023. The increase to stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to stock modifications (the exchange and extension of the expiration date) on 3,460,000 previously issued stock options to various employees until December 1, 2027. In addition, the Company issued 5,895,000 new stock options to company executives and to the Chairman of the Board of the Directors which vested immediately and have an expiration date of December 1, 2027.\nLegal and professional fees. Legal and professional fees increased by $497,000, or 16%, from the year ended July 31, 2022 to the year ended July 31, 2023, which include legal and professional fees that relate to due diligence, audits for the acquisitions, purchase price allocation, legal fees paid in accordance with the Credit Agreement, dated as of November 17, 2020 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement), among the Operating Subsidiaries, Post Road Special Opportunity Fund II LLP (PRSOF), as a lender, the other lenders party thereto and Post Road Administrative LLC (PR Administrative and, together with its affiliate PRSOF, Post Road), as administrative agent for the lenders, to counsel for Post Road, and investor relations.\nBad debt. Bad debt increased by $17,000, or 17%, from the year ended July 31, 2022 to the year ended July 31, 2023. The increase is attributed to the recognition of $115,000 in bad debt for accounts deemed uncollectible during the year ended July 31, 2023. During the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company recognized $98,000 in bad debt.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased by $993,000, or 34%, from the year ended July 31, 2022 to the year ended July 31, 2023. The increase is primarily attributed to the acquisitions and related amortization for intangible assets and the additional depreciation related to the assets acquired from Skynet and NextLevel. In addition, the Company experienced an increase in amortization for Right-of-Use assets.\nOperating loss. The Company reported an operating loss of $5,055,000 for the year ended July 31, 2023 as compared to an operating loss of $3,676,000 for the year ended July 31, 2022. The increase in operating loss of $1,379,000, or 38%, between periods is primarily due to net increases in SG&A (including stock-based compensation) of $5,401,000, an increase in legal and professional fees of $497,000, increases in cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) of $1,940,000, $17,000 for bad debt, and $993,000 for depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by the improvement in gross margin of $5,529,000.\nGain on derivative instruments. The gain on derivative instruments increased by $340,000, or 5%, from the year ended July 31, 2022 to the year ended July 31, 2023. We are required to re-measure all derivative instruments at the end of each reporting period and adjust those instruments to market. As a result of the re-measurement of all derivative instruments we recognized a gain or loss between periods.\nGain (loss) on extinguishment of debt. For the year ended July 31, 2023, the gain on extinguishment of debt was $55,000. For the year ended July 31, 2022, the loss on extinguishment of debt was $5,481,000. On December 20, 2021, the Operating Subsidiaries and Post Road entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Amendment) in connection with which Verve Cloud Nevada incurred additional indebtedness under the Credit Agreement in a principal amount of $3,500,000, accrued interest of $187,442, and an amendment fee of $1,418,744 which were recapitalized under the revised A&R Term Loan A. Pursuant to the Amendment, $6,000,000 was applied to fund the acquisition of Skynet Telecom LLCs assets, professional fees and other fees and expenses with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Amendment and for general corporate and working capital purposes of the Operating Subsidiaries. The Company determined that the recapitalization of the debt under the Credit Agreement under the Amendment constituted an extinguishment of debt and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $5,480,000, which is comprises the full amortization debt discount of $4,061,000 and amendment fees of $1,419,000.\nOther income (expense). Other income (expense) increased by $439,000, or 1,688%, from the year ended July 31, 2022 to the year ended July 31, 2023. The increase in other income is mostly due to the recognition of a gain on a settlement of conversion premium of $466,000 from a convertible note.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased by $5,338,000, or 89%, from the year ended July 31, 2022 to the year ended July 31, 2023. During the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company recognized amortization of debt discount of $2,930,000 related to the adjustment to the present value of various convertible notes, debt, and warrants. Additionally, the Company recognized $2,289,000 in interest cash payments to Post Road and other lenders, accrual of approximately $2,465,000 for interest expense for various promissory notes and $589,000 fair value of shares issued, as well $2,886,361 consisting of $2,108,724 interest to Post Road, and $777,637 added to various other promissory notes, all charged to interest expense as consideration for extension of the maturity dates.\nIncome tax expense. During the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company recognized an income tax expense of $192,000. During the year ended July 31, 2022 the Company recognized an income tax expense of $419,000.\nNet loss including noncontrolling interest. Net loss including noncontrolling interest for the year ended July 31, 2022 was $9,354,000 as compared to the net loss of $9,529,000 for the year ended July 31, 2023. The decrease in net loss including noncontrolling interest between periods is primarily due to a decrease in total other expense of $1,204,000 partially offset by an increase in the operating loss of $1,379,000.\nNet loss attributable to Digeratis shareholders. Net loss for the year ended July 31, 2023 was $8,291,000 as compared to a net loss for the year ended July 31, 2022 of $8,013,000.\nDeemed dividend on Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Dividend accrued on convertible preferred stock for the year ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 was $8,000 and $19,000, respectively.\nNet loss attributable to Digeratis common shareholders. Net loss for the year ended July 31, 2023 was $8,299,000 compared to a net loss for the year ended July 31, 2022 of $8,032,000.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures - Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA - OPCO and Adjusted EBITDA - Income\nEBITDA from operations and income, as adjusted, are non-GAAP measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss), cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as corporate expenses, transactional legal expenses, stock option expense, and depreciation and amortization, which are significant components in assessing the Companys financial performance. The Company believes that the presentation of EBITDA from operations and income, as adjusted, provides useful information regarding the Companys operations and other factors that affect the Companys reported results. Specifically, the Company believes that by excluding certain one-time or non-cash items such as transactional legal fees and depreciation and amortization, as well as potential distortions between periods caused by factors such as financing and capital structures, the Company provides users of its consolidated financial statements with insight into both its operations as well as the factors that affect reported results between periods but which the Company believes are not representative of its operations. As a result, users of the Companys consolidated financial statements are better able to evaluate changes in the financial consolidated results of the Company across different periods.\nThe following tables provide information regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures for Digerati for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022. Management utilizes these metrics to track and forecast revenue trends and expected results from operations:\nConsolidated Statement of Operations\n(In thousands)\nYear ended July 31,\nVariances %\nOPERATING REVENUES:\nCloud-based hosted services $ 31,623 $ 24,154 $ 7,469 31 %\nTotal operating revenues 31,623 24,154 7,469 31 %\nCost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 11,286 9,346 1,940 21 %\nSelling, general and administrative expense 16,954 12,210 4,744 39 %\nStock compensation expense 293 %\nLegal and professional fees 3,533 3,036 16 %\nBad debt 17 %\nDepreciation and amortization expense 3,909 2,916 34 %\nTotal operating expenses 36,678 27,830 8,848 32 %\nOPERATING LOSS (5,055 ) (3,676 ) (1,379 ) 38 %\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE):\nGain (loss) on derivative instruments 6,526 6,186 5 %\nGain (loss) on extinguishment of debt (5,481 ) 5,536 -101 %\nOther income (expense) 1688 %\nInterest expense (11,328 ) (5,990 ) (5,338 ) 89 %\nIncome tax expense (192 ) (419 ) -54 %\nTotal other income (expense) (4,474 ) (5,678 ) 1,204 -21 %\nNET INCOME (LOSS) INCLUDING NONCONTROLLING INTEREST (9,529 ) (9,354 ) (175 ) 2 %\nLess: Net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests 1,238 1,341 (103 ) -8 %\nNET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIGERATIS SHAREHOLDERS $ (8,291 ) $ (8,013 ) $ (278 ) 3 %\nDeemed dividend on Series A Convertible preferred stock (8 ) (19 ) -58 %\nNET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIGERATIS COMMON SHAREHOLDERS $ (8,299 ) $ (8,032 ) $ (267 ) 3 %\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA - OPCO, Net of Non-Cash Expenses & Transactional\n(In thousands)\nYear ended July 31,\nVariances %\nNET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIGERATIS SHAREHOLDERS, as reported $ (8,291 ) $ (8,013 ) $ (278 ) 3 %\nEXCLUDING NON-CASH ITEMS TRANSACTIONAL COSTS & CORP EXP\nADJUSTMENTS:\nStock compensation & warrant expense 293 %\nCorp Expenses (Net of stock compensation, Legal fees & Transactional cost) 1,529 1,385 10 %\nLegal, professional fees & transactional costs 3,510 2,703 30 %\nDepreciation and amortization expense 3,909 2,916 34 %\nOTHER ADJUSTMENTS\nGain (loss) on derivative instruments (6,526 ) (6,186 ) (340 ) 5 %\nGain (loss) on extinguishment of debt (55 ) 5,481 (5,536 ) -101 %\nOther income (expense) (465 ) (26 ) (439 ) 1688 %\nInterest expense 11,328 5,990 5,338 89 %\nIncome tax expense (227 ) -54 %\nLess: Net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests (1,238 ) (1,341 ) -8 %\nADJUSTED EBITDA - OPCO $ 4,774 $ 3,552 $ 1,222 34 %\nADD-BACKS Expenses\nCorp Expenses (Net of stock compensation, Legal fees & Transactional cost) 1,529 1,385 10 %\nADJUSTED EBITDA - INCOME $ 3,245 $ 2,167 $ 1,078 50 %\nYear ended July 31,\nOther Key Metrics\nVariances\n%\nTotal Customers\n4,671\n4,023\n%\nCloud software and service revenue increased by $7,469,000, or 31%, from the year ended July 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2023. In addition, our gross margin increased by $5,529,000, or 37%, during Fiscal Year 2023. The increase in revenue and gross margin for the entirety of fiscal year 2023 versus only part of fiscal year 2022 is primarily attributed to the increase in total customers between years due to the acquisitions of Skynet in December 2021 and NextLevel in February 2022.\nEBITDA from operations, as adjusted, increased by $1,222,000, or 34%, from the year ended July 31, 2022 to the year ended July 31, 2023. The primary reason for the improvement in EBITDA from operations is due to the increase in gross margin of $5,529,000 during Fiscal Year 2023. The improvement in gross margin was offset by the increase in total operational expenses between the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2023. (See table above for the adjustments to Net Income (Loss) attributable to Digerati shareholders.) EBITDA from operations, as adjusted, is not intended to represent cash flows for the periods presented, nor have they been presented as an alternative to operating income or as an indicator of operating performance and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).\nEBITDA from income, as adjusted, increased by $1,078,000, or 50%, from the year ended July 31, 2022 to the year ended July 31, 2023. The primary reason for the improvement in EBITDA from operations is due to the increase in gross margin of $5,529,000 during Fiscal Year 2023. EBITDA from income, as adjusted, is not intended to represent cash flows for the periods presented, nor have they been presented as an alternative to operating income or as an indicator of operating performance and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).\nOur total customers increased from 4,023 during the year ended July 31, 2022 to 4,671 for the year ended July 31, 2023. Going forward, absent future acquisitions, we expect a net increase in our number of customers of 1% to 5% each fiscal year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Position: We had a consolidated cash balance of approximately $924,000 as of July 31, 2023. Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended July 31, 2023 was approximately $3,222,000. The increase in net cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from the net loss incurred during the year ended July 31, 2023 as a result of operating expenses, that included $881,000 in stock compensation and warrant expense, bad debt expense of $115,000, amortization of right-of-use assets of $696,000, amortization of debt discount of $2,930,000, depreciation and amortization expense of $3,909,000, debt extension fee charged to interest expense of $864,000, warrants issued for debt extension for $170,000, and common stock issued for debt extension charged to interest expense of $589,000, partially offset by gain on settlement of conversion premium of $466,000, gain on derivative liability of $6,526,000, gain on extinguishment of debt of $55,000, and change in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net increase of $3,200,000.\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended July 31, 2023 was $436,000, which was used for the acquisition of equipment.\nCash provided by financing activities during the year ended July 31, 2023 was $3,073,000. The net increase in cash provided by financing was primarily due to the Company securing $4,541,000 from convertible notes, net of issuance costs and discounts and securing $250,000 from debt financing from a related party, net of issuance costs and discounts, proceeds from the exercise of warrants of $22,000, proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $50,000, partially offset by principal payments of $785,000 on various convertible notes, principal payments of $298,000 on debt, principal payments of $568,000 on related party notes, and principal payments of $139,000 on equipment financing.\nOverall, our net operating, investing, and financing activities during the year ended July 31, 2023 resulted in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents for $585,000.\nDigeratis consolidated financial statements for the year ended July 31, 2023 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. Since the Companys inception in 1993, Digerati has incurred net losses and accumulated a deficit of approximately $121,684,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately $65,279,000 which raises substantial doubt about Digeratis ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe are currently taking initiatives to reduce our overall cash deficiencies on a monthly basis. During Fiscal Year 2023, certain members of our management team continued to receive a portion of their compensation in common stock to reduce the depletion of our available cash. To strengthen our business, we intend to adopt best practices from our recent acquisitions and invest in a marketing and sales strategy to grow our monthly recurring revenue; we anticipate utilizing our value-added resellers and channel partners to tap into new sources of revenue streams; and we have also secured numerous agent agreements through our recent acquisitions that we anticipate will accelerate revenue growth. In addition, we will continue to focus on selling a greater number of comprehensive services to our existing customer base. Further, in an effort to increase our revenues, we will continue to evaluate the acquisition of various assets with emphasis in VoIP Services and Cloud Communication Services. As a result, during the process of evaluating such acquisitions we anticipate incurring significant legal and professional fees.\nThe Company anticipates issuing additional equity, entering into additional convertible notes and/or obtaining other indebtedness to secure the funding required to meet these cash needs. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or raise them on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to meet its interest payments, capital expenditures and operational needs. As a result, the Company will be required to negotiate with its lender the terms of the current financing agreements, in addition to postponing the timing of deployment of its capital expenditures and extending the timing of the operational cash needs.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and indemnification provisions. The Credit Agreement also contains affirmative and negative covenants with respect to the operation of the business and properties of the loan parties as well as financial performance.\nBelow are key financial covenant requirements, (measured quarterly) for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2023:\n\u25cf Maximum-Allowed - Senior Leverage Ratio of 3.55 to 1.00\n\u25cf Minimum-Allowed - EBITDA (on an annualized basis) of $4,394,867\n\u25cf Minimum-Allowed - Liquidity of $2,000,000\n\u25cf Maximum Allowed - Capital Expenditures of $94,798 (Quarterly)\n\u25cf Minimum-Allowed - Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.50 to 1.00\n\u25cf Maximum Allowed - Churn of 3.00% at any time\nAs of July 31, 2023, the Company was not in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. This noncompliance, together with certain other events of default that have occurred and are continuing under the Credit Agreement, resulted in our classifying the indebtedness under the Credit Agreement as a current liability.\nThe Operating Subsidiaries obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by first priority security interests in (a) the equity interests of the Operating Subsidiaries (other than Verve Cloud Nevada), pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, dated November 17, 2020 (the Pledge Agreement), made by Verve Cloud Nevada in favor of Post Road Administrative and (b) substantially all of the other assets of the Operating Subsidiaries, pursuant to the Guaranty and Collateral Agreement, dated November 17, 2020, subsequently amended on December 31, 2021, February 4, 2022, December 15, 2022, and February 3, 2023 (the Guaranty and Collateral Agreement), among the Operating Subsidiaries and Post Road Administrative.\nDuring the period beginning on August 1, 2021, and ending on July 31, 2023, the Company and Post Road entered into several amendments and other modifications to the Credit Agreement. Specifically:\n\u25cf On December 15, 2022, Post Road agreed to forbear from exercising its remedies in connection with the Companys failure to comply with the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement as of the last day of the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2022, as well as certain other specified defaults, until December 23, 2022.\n\u25cf On February 3, 2023, with an effective date of December 23, 2022, Digerati, the Operating Subsidiaries and Post Road entered into a Consent, Limited Waiver and Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement and Amendment to Notes (the Fourth Amendment). Among other things, the Fourth Amendment (a) conditionally revised each of the six financial covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement (related to maximum leverage, minimum liquidity, minimum EBITDA, maximum capital expenditures, minimum interest coverage (a provision that replaced the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio provision), and maximum churn), (b) conditionally waived all then-existing events of default under the Credit Agreement and (c) modified the interest rates payable under the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Fourth Amendment provided that none of the revised financial covenants (other than minimum liquidity of $1,000,000, which was tested and met as of January 21, 2023) would be tested as of the last day of the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2023 so long as no additional events of default occurred prior to such date. The conditional revisions to the financial covenants and the conditional waivers of existing events of default in the Fourth Amendment were contingent on the consummation of the Merger with MEOA by February 28, 2023 (the Merger Outside Closing Date). If the Merger was not consummated by the Merger Outside Closing Date, the terms of the financial covenants would revert to the terms in effect immediately prior to the Fourth Amendment and the existing events of default would continue unwaived. The Merger Outside Closing Date was, as described below, extended several times, but the termination of the Business Combination Agreement with MEOA has effectively nullified the revisions to the financial covenants and conditional waivers set forth in the Fourth Amendment.\n\u25cf On March 13, 2023, Digerati, the Operating Subsidiaries, and Post Road entered into the Fifth Amendment to Credit Agreement, with an effective date of February 28, 2023, which specifically extended the Merger Outside Closing Date from February 28, 2023, to April 28, 2023.\n\u25cf On April 3, 2023, Digerati, the Operating Subsidiaries, and Post Road entered into a Sixth Amendment to its Credit Agreement (the Sixth Amendment), which (a) deferred the cash interest otherwise due and payable on April 1, 2023, to May 1, 2023, and (b) increased the net principal amount of additional convertible notes the Company was permitted by the Credit Agreement to have outstanding from $3,000,000 to $3,500,000.\n\u25cf On May 1, 2023, with an effective date of April 28, 2023, Digerati, the Operating Subsidiaries, and Post Road entered into a Seventh Amendment to Credit Agreement (the Seventh Amendment), pursuant to which the Merger Outside Closing Date was extended from April 28, 2023, to May 31, 2023, or such later date as agreed to in writing by Post Road in its sole discretion.\n\u25cf On August 16, 2023, Digerati, the Operating Subsidiaries and Post Road entered into a letter agreement, pursuant to which Post Road agreed that all accrued interest that was originally due and payable in cash by the Operating Subsidiaries on April 3, 2023, May 1, 2023, June 1, 2023, July 3, 2023 and August 1, 2023 would, instead, be added to the outstanding principal balances of Term Loan A and Term Loan C, as applicable, under the Credit Agreement on the effective date of the letter agreement, and due on the maturity dates of such loans, along with all other principal and interest amounts thereunder.\nAdditionally, on November 22, 2023 (with effect from November 2, 2023), Verve Cloud, Inc. (Verve Cloud) and Verve Clouds subsidiaries (Verve Cloud and its subsidiaries, collectively, the Verve Cloud Nevada Parties), Digerati and Post Road entered into a Second Forbearance Agreement, Amendment to Loan Documents and Limited Consent, which (a) extends the maturity date of our Term Loan C Note with Post Road from November 2, 2023, to December 31, 2023, (b) provides that Post Road and the other lenders under the Credit Agreement shall forbear through December 31, 2023 from exercising their rights and remedies under the loan documents and applicable law with respect to (i) certain existing events of default under the loan documents and (ii) certain events of default that are expected to arise before December 31, 2023, and (c) amends certain provisions of the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents to allow the company to incur up to an additional $2,000,000 of working capital financing. For additional information regarding the Second Forbearance Agreement, Amendment to Loan Documents and Limited Consent, see Note 18 - Subsequent Events to the Consolidated Financial Statements; see also Part II, Item 9B, Other Information to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have been successful in raising debt and equity capital in the past and as described in Notes 10, 11, and 12 to the financial statements. We have financing efforts in place to continue to raise cash through debt and equity offerings. Although we have successfully completed financings and reduced expenses in the past, we cannot assure you that our plans to address these matters in the future will be successful. The Company will continue to work with various funding sources to secure additional debt and equity financings. However, Digerati cannot offer any assurance that it will be successful in executing the aforementioned plans to continue as a going concern.\nManagement believes that available resources as of July 31, 2023, will not be sufficient to fund the Companys operations, debt service and corporate expenses over the next 12 months. The Companys ability to continue to meet its obligations and to achieve its business objectives is dependent upon, among other things, raising additional capital, issuing stock-based compensation to certain members of the executive management team in lieu of cash, and/or generating sufficient revenue in excess of costs. At such time as the Company requires additional funding, the Company will seek to secure such best-efforts funding from various possible sources, including equity or debt financing, sales of assets, or collaborative arrangements. If the Company raises additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity, stockholders will experience dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of the holders of common stock or convertible senior notes. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing debt, the Company may be subject to limitations on its operations, through debt covenants or other restrictions. If the Company obtains additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or strategic partners, the Company may be required to relinquish its rights to certain technologies. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or raise them on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, it may be unable to execute its business plan, the Company could be required to curtail its operations, and the Company may not be able to pay off its obligations, if and when they come due.\nOur current cash expenses are expected to be approximately $1,300,000 per month, including wages, rent, utilities, corporate expenses, and legal professional fees associated with potential acquisitions. As described elsewhere herein, we are not generating sufficient cash from operations to pay for our corporate and ongoing operating expenses, or to pay our current liabilities. As of July 31, 2023, our total liabilities were approximately $69,276,000, which included $4,125,000 in derivative liabilities. We will continue to use our available cash on hand to cover our deficiencies in operating expenses. Our cash requirements to meet our interest payments to Post Road, capital expenditure needs, and operational cash flow needs over the next 18 months are estimated to be approximately $3,500,000.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nWe believe that our accounting policies and estimates are critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets include the cost of the acquired business in excess of the fair value of the tangible net assets recorded in connection with an acquisition. Other intangible assets include customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and trademarks. The Company uses a third-party specialty valuation firm to value its intangible assets acquired in its business combination and asset acquisitions.\nIn accordance with FASB ASC 350-20-35, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, a third-party specialty valuation firm tested our goodwill for impairment. Based upon their impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, management of the Company has agreed with our third-party valuation firm in their conclusion that there was no impairment of goodwill at July 31, 2023.\nIn accordance with FASB ASC 360-10-35, Property, Plant, and Equipment, a third-party specialty valuation firm reviewed our long-lived asset groups, including property and equipment and other intangible assets, for impairment whenever events indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. When it is determined that one or more impairment indicators are present for an asset group, it is necessary to compare the carrying amount of the asset group to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset group is expected to generate. If the carrying amount of the asset group is greater than the net future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. The management of the Company has agreed with the third-party specialty valuation firm in their conclusion that there were no impairment indicators relating to our long-lived assets as July 31, 2023.\nRevenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenues from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606).\nThe Company recognizes cloud-based hosted services revenue, mainly from subscription services for its cloud telephony applications that includes hosted IP/PBX services, SIP trunking, call center applications, auto attendant, voice and web conferencing, call recording, messaging, voicemail to email conversion, integrated mobility applications that are device and location agnostic, and other customized applications. Other services include enterprise-class data and connectivity solutions through multiple broadband technologies including cloud WAN or SD-WAN, fiber, and Ethernet over copper. We also offer remote network monitoring, data backup and disaster recovery services. The Company applies a five-step approach in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (1) identifying the contract with a customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognizing revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. Substantially all of the Companys revenue is recognized over time, on a monthly basis, as services are rendered or at a point in time when control of the products transfers to the customer.\nDerivative financial instruments. Digerati does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. However, Digerati analyzes its convertible instruments and free-standing instruments such as warrants for derivative liability accounting.\nFor derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date. Any changes in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period. For derivative notes payable conversion options Digerati uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments.\nThe classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument is probable within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of July 31, 2023, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nNot Applicable to smaller reporting companies. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nConsolidated Financial Statements of Digerati Technologies, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 206)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of July 31, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the Years Ended July 31, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders Deficit for the Years Ended July 31, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended July 31, 2023 and 2022\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of\nDigerati Technologies, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Digerati Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern Matter\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ MaloneBailey, LLP\nwww.malonebailey.com\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2018.\nHouston, Texas\nNovember 22, 2023\nPART 1.

Digeratis product line includes a portfolio of Internet-based telephony products and services delivered through its cloud application platform and session-based communication network and network services including Internet broadband, fiber, mobile broadband, and cloud Wide Area Network (WAN) or Software-defined Wide Area Network (SD WAN) solutions.\nDigerati formerly had four (4) operating subsidiaries: (i) Verve Cloud, Inc., a Texas entity (this entity was formerly known as Shift8 Networks, Inc.); (ii) T3 Communications, Inc., a Florida entity; (iii) Nexogy, Inc., a Florida entity; and (iv) NextLevel Internet, Inc., a California entity. Each of these entities was a subsidiary of Verve Cloud, Inc., a Nevada entity (formerly known as T3 Communications, Inc.) which was formed on March 27, 2023. Effective June 1, 2023, each of our operating subsidiaries were consolidated as one single entity reporting as Verve Cloud, Inc.\nDigerati provides enterprise-class, carrier-grade services to the small-to-medium-sized business (SMB) at cost-effective monthly rates. Digeratis UCaaS or cloud communication services include fully hosted Internet Protocol (IP)/private branch exchange (PBX), video conferencing, mobile applications, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) transport, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunking, and customized VoIP services all delivered Only in the Cloud\u2122.\nPrinciples of Consolidation.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Digerati, and its subsidiaries, which are majority owned by Digerati in accordance with ASC 810-10-05, Consolidation. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nCost Method Investment.\nOn June 14, 2019, the Company, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Agreement) to acquire a 12% minority interest in Itellum Comunicacions Costa Rica, S.R.L. The Company paid $100,000 in cash, issued 500,000 shares of common stock with a market value of $85,000. As result, the Company holds a minority interest in Itellum for an investment of $185,000. The Company has no influence over the operating and financial policies of Itellum. The Company has no controlling interest, is not the primary beneficiary and does not have the ability to exert significant influence. As a result, we accounted for this investment using the measurement alternative, defined as cost, less impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer.\nUse of Estimates.\nIn preparing financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and revenue and expenses in the statement of operations. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nBeneficial conversion features.\nThe Company evaluates the conversion feature for whether it was beneficial as described in ASC 470-30. The intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion feature inherent to a convertible note payable, which is not bifurcated and accounted for separately from the convertible note payable and may not be settled in cash upon conversion, is treated as a discount to the convertible note payable. This discount is amortized over the period from the date of issuance to the date the note is due using the effective interest method. If the note payable is retired prior to the end of its contractual term, the unamortized discount is expensed in the period of retirement to interest expense. In general, the beneficial conversion feature is measured by comparing the effective conversion price, after considering the relative fair value of detachable instruments included in the financing transaction, if any, to the fair value of the shares of common stock at the commitment date to be received upon conversion.\nRelated parties.\nThe Company accounts for related party transactions in accordance with ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures (ASC 850). A party is considered to be related to the Company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related party.\nConcentration of Credit Risk.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject Digerati to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables. In the normal course of business, Digerati provides credit terms to its customers. Accordingly, Digerati performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for possible losses, which, when realized, have been within the range of managements expectations. Digerati maintains cash in bank deposit accounts, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Digerati has not experienced any losses in such accounts and Digerati does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.\nRevenue Recognition.\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenues from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606).\nSources of revenue:\nCloud-based hosted Services. The Company recognizes cloud-based hosted services revenue, mainly from subscription services for its cloud telephony applications that includes hosted IP/PBX services, SIP trunking, call center applications, auto attendant, voice, and web conferencing, call recording, messaging, voicemail to email conversion, integrated mobility applications that are device and location agnostic, and other customized applications. Other services include enterprise-class data and connectivity solutions through multiple broadband technologies including cloud WAN or SD-WAN, fiber, and Ethernet over copper. We also offer remote network monitoring, data backup and disaster recovery services. The Company applies a five-step approach in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (1) identifying the contract with a customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognizing revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. Substantially all of the Companys revenue is recognized over time, on a monthly basis, as services are rendered or at a point in time when control of the products transfers to the customer.\nService Revenue.\nService revenue from subscriptions to the Companys cloud-based technology platform is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contractual subscription term beginning on the date that the platform is made available to the customer. Payments received in advance of subscription services being rendered are recorded as a deferred revenue. Usage fees, either bundled or not bundled, are recognized when the Company has a right to invoice. Professional services for configuration, system integration, optimization, customer training and/or education are primarily billed on a fixed-fee basis and are performed by the Company directly. Alternatively, customers may choose to perform these services themselves or engage their own third-party service providers. Professional services revenue is recognized over time, generally as services are activated for the customer.\nProduct Revenue.\nThe Company recognizes product revenue for telephony equipment at a point in time, when transfer of control has occurred, which is generally upon delivery. Sales returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue estimated based on historical experience.\nDisaggregation of Cloud-based hosted revenues.\nSummary of disaggregated revenue is as follows (in thousands):\nFor the Years Ended\nJuly 31,\nCloud software and service revenue $ 31,370 $ 23,871\nProduct revenue\nTotal operating revenues $ 31,623 $ 24,154\nContract Assets.\nContract assets are recorded for those parts of the contract consideration not yet invoiced but for which the performance obligations are completed. The revenue is recognized when the customer receives services or equipment for a reduced consideration at the onset of an arrangement; for example, when the initial months services or equipment are discounted. Contract assets are included in prepaid and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets, depending on if their reduction is recognized during the succeeding 12-month period or beyond. Contract assets as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, were $0 and $6,701, respectively.\nDeferred Income.\nDeferred income represents billings or payment received in advance of revenue recognition and is recognized upon transfer of control. Balances consist primarily of annual plan subscription services, for services not yet provided as of the balance sheet date. Deferred revenues that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period are recorded as current deferred revenues in the consolidated balance sheets, with the remainder recorded as other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred income as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, was $281,294 and $66,167, respectively. All of the deferred revenue as of July 31, 2022 were recognized as revenues during the year ended July 31, 2023.\nCustomer deposits.\nThe Company in some instances requires customers to make deposits for the last month of services, equipment, installation charges and training. As equipment is installed and training takes places the deposits are then applied to revenue. The deposit for the last month of services is applied to any outstanding balances if services are cancelled. If the customers account is paid in full, the Company will refund the full deposit in the month following service termination. As of July 31, 2023 and 2022, Digeratis customer deposits balance was $842,956 and $864,345, respectively. The customer deposit balance is included as part of deferred income on the consolidated balance sheets.\nCosts to Obtain a Customer Contract.\nDirect incremental costs of obtaining a contract, consisting of sales commissions, are deferred, and amortized over the estimated life of the customer, which currently averages 36 months. The Company calculates the estimated life of the customer on an annual basis. The Company classifies deferred commissions as prepaid expenses or other noncurrent assets based on the timing of when it expects to recognize the expense. As of July 31, 2023, the Company has $798,555 in deferred commissions/contract costs, of which the current portion of $340,224 is included in prepaid and other current assets and the long-term portion of $458,331 in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Sales commissions expensed for the year ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, were $2,818,681 and $2,262,129, respectively.\nDirect Costs - Cloud-based hosted Services.\nWe incur bandwidth and colocation charges in connection with our UCaaS or cloud communication services. The bandwidth charges are incurred as part of the connectivity between our customers to allow them access to our various services. We also incur costs from underlying providers for fiber, internet broadband, and telecommunication circuits in connection with our data and connectivity solutions.\nCash and cash equivalents.\nThe Company considers all bank deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts.\nBad debt expense is recognized based on managements estimate of likely losses each year based on past experience and an estimate of current year uncollectible amounts. As of July 31, 2023 and 2022, Digeratis allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $37,962 and $74,628, respectively.\nProperty and equipment.\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Additions are capitalized and maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Gains and losses on dispositions of equipment are reflected in operations. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are one (1) to seven (7) years.\nGoodwill.\nGoodwill is carried at cost and is not amortized. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal year, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. Company management uses its judgment in assessing whether goodwill has become impaired between annual impairment tests according to specifications set forth in ASC 350. The Company completed an evaluation of goodwill at July 31, 2023 and 2022 and determined that there was no impairment.\nThe fair value of the Companys reporting unit is dependent upon the Companys estimate of future cash flows and other factors. The Companys estimates of future cash flows include assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions and may differ from actual future cash flows. Estimated future cash flows are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from the Companys market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at date of the evaluation.\nThe financial and credit market volatility directly impacts the Companys fair value measurement through the Companys weighted average cost of capital that the Company uses to determine its discount rate and through the Companys stock price that the Company uses to determine its market capitalization. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded.\nIntangible Assets.\nOur intangible assets consist of customer relationships, developed technologies, trademarks and trade name. The Company recognizes an acquired intangible asset apart from goodwill whenever the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights, or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability. The intangible assets are amortized following the patterns in which the economic benefits are consumed or straight-line over the estimated useful life. We periodically review the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets and review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. The determination of impairment is based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows. If an intangible asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of the impairment will be equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets include the cost of the acquired business in excess of the fair value of the tangible net assets recorded in connection with an acquisition. Other intangible assets include customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and trademarks. The Company uses a third-party specialty valuation firm to value its intangible assets acquired in its business combination and asset acquisitions.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company acquired Skynet Telecom LLC and Next Level Internet, Inc. the acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, with the Company identified as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the purchase prices of acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities were recorded and allocated at fair value on a relative basis as of acquisition dates. The Company based its estimates on historical experience, discounted cash flows and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances at the time of acquisition, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the fair value of the intangible assets acquired that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results from these acquisitions may differ from these estimates.\nLong-Lived Assets.\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets, including property and equipment and identifiable intangibles annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. To determine recoverability of its long-lived assets, the Company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the assets.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets.\nDigerati reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. Digerati assesses recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the assets carrying value and fair value.\nBusiness combinations.\nEach investment in a business is being measured and determined whether the investment should be accounted for as a cost-basis investment, an equity investment, a business combination, or a common control transaction. An investment in which the Company does not have a controlling interest and which the Company is not the primary beneficiary but where the Company has the ability to exert significant influence is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. For those investments that we account for in accordance ASC 805, Business Combinations, the Company records the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the managements estimate of their fair values on the date of the business combination. The assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on the reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives. Furthermore, according to ASC 805-50-30-5, when accounting for a transfer of assets or exchange of shares between entities under common control, the entity that receives the net assets or the equity interests shall initially measure the recognized assets and liabilities transferred at their carrying amounts in the accounts of the transferring entity at the date of transfer.\nTreasury Shares.\nAs a result of entering into various convertible debt instruments which contained a variable conversion feature with no floor, warrants with fixed exercise price, and convertible notes with fixed conversion price or with a conversion price floor, we reserved 109,000,000 treasury shares for consideration for future conversions and exercise of warrants. The Company will evaluate the reserved treasury shares on a quarterly basis, and if necessary, reserve additional treasury shares. As of July 31, 2023, we believe that the treasury share reserved are sufficient for any future conversions of these instruments. As a result, these debt instruments and warrants are excluded from derivative consideration.\nDerivative financial instruments.\nDigerati does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. However, Digerati analyzes its convertible instruments and free-standing instruments such as warrants for derivative liability accounting.\nFor derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date. Any changes in fair value are recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period. For derivative notes payable conversion options and warrants Digerati uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments.\nThe classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument is probable within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments.\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy is used which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy based on the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.\nFor certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of our long-term debt approximates its fair value based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities.\nOur derivative liabilities as of July 31, 2023 and 2022 amounted to $4,125,429 and $10,587,717, respectively.\nThe following table provides the fair value of the derivative financial instruments measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs:\nFair value measurements at reporting date using:\nDescription Fair Value Quoted prices in\nactive markets\nfor identical\nliabilities\n(Level 1) Significant\nother\nobservable\ninputs\n(Level 2) Significant\nunobservable inputs\n(Level 3)\nConvertible promissory notes derivative liability at July 31, 2022 $ 10,587,717 - - $ 10,587,717\nConvertible promissory notes derivative liability at July 31, 2023 $ 4,125,429 - - $ 4,125,429\nThe fair market value of all derivatives during the year ended July 31, 2023, was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which used the following assumptions:\nExpected dividend yield 0.00%\nExpected stock price volatility 169.54% - 178.58%\nRisk-free interest rate 3.97% - 5.55%\nExpected term 0.25 - 7.30 years\nThe fair market value of all derivatives during the year ended July 31, 2022, was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which used the following assumptions:\nExpected dividend yield 0.00%\nExpected stock price volatility 63.32% - 250.19%\nRisk-free interest rate 0.03% - 2.98%\nExpected term 0.05 - 9.50 years\nThe following table provides a summary of the changes in fair value of the derivative financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs:\nBalance at July 31, 2021 $ 16,773,383\nDerivative gain (6,185,666 )\nBalance at July 31, 2022 $ 10,587,717\nDerivative from new convertible promissory notes recorded as debt discount\n63,805\nDerivative gain (6,526,093 )\nBalance at July 31, 2023 $ 4,125,429\nIncome taxes.\nDigerati recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. Digerati provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not.\nSince January 1, 2007, Digerati accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on income taxes which addresses how an entity should recognize, measure and present in the financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return. Pursuant to this guidance, Digerati recognizes a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit. To the extent the more likely than not standard has been satisfied, the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. As of July 31, 2023 and 2022, we have no liability for unrecognized tax benefits.\nStock-based compensation.\nStock-based compensation. The Company accounts for its share-based awards under ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Employee and non-employee stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period. During Fiscal Years 2023 and 2022, the Company issued 1,370,551 common shares and 1,500,000 common shares, respectively, to professionals for exchange of services and to various employees as stock in lieu of cash compensation. During FY 2023 and 2022, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $0 (the stock-based compensation expense for the 1,370,551 common shares were expensed in a prior fiscal year) and $125,250, respectively, equivalent to the market value of the shares issued calculated based on the shares closing price at the grant dates. During Fiscal Year 2023, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $881,000 related to stock options previously issued to various employees.\nBasic and diluted net income (loss) per share.\nThe basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted on an as if converted basis, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, potential dilutive securities including options and warrants were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per common share as their effect would be anti-dilutive due to the Companys net loss. Potential dilutive securities, which are not included in dilutive weighted average shares are as follows:\nOptions to purchase common stock $ 13,805,000 $ 9,130,000\nWarrants to purchase common stock 124,942,900 108,841,179\nConvertible debt 105,431,080 43,628,667\nConvertible Series A Preferred stock - 750,000\nConvertible Series B Preferred stock 28,967,703 25,575,847\nConvertible Series C Preferred stock 35,404,971 31,259,369\nTotal $ 308,551,654 $ 219,185,062\nNoncontrolling interest.\nThe Company follows ASC Topic 810, which governs the accounting for and reporting of non-controlling interests (NCIs) in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and the loss of control of subsidiaries. Certain provisions of this standard indicate, among other things, that NCIs be treated as a separate component of equity, not as a liability, that increases and decreases in the parents ownership interest that leave control intact be treated as equity transactions rather than as step acquisitions or dilution gains or losses, and that losses of a partially owned consolidated subsidiary be allocated to the NCI even when such allocation might result in a deficit balance. The net income (loss) attributed to the NCI is separately designated in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income (loss).\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements.\nRecent accounting pronouncements, other than below, issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA and the SEC did not, or are not, believed by management to have a material effect on the Companys present or future financial statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments. The guidance removes certain accounting models which separate the embedded conversion features from the host contract for convertible instruments. Either a modified retrospective method of transition or a fully retrospective method of transition is permissible for the adoption of this standard. Update No. 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this ASU on its financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The standards main goal is to improve financial reporting by requiring earlier recognition of credit losses on financing receivables and other financial assets in scope. Update No. 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this ASU on its financial statements.\nNOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN\nFinancial Condition\nThe Companys consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. Since the Companys inception in 1993, the Company has incurred net losses and accumulated a deficit of approximately $121,684,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately $65,279,000 which raises substantial doubt about Digeratis ability to continue as a going concern. The Companys consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nManagement Plans to Continue as a Going Concern\nManagement believes that available resources as of July 31, 2023, will not be sufficient to fund the Companys operations and corporate expenses over the next 12 months. The Companys ability to continue to meet its obligations and to achieve its business objectives is dependent upon, and other things, raising additional capital, issuing stock-based compensation to certain members of the executive management team in lieu of cash, or generating sufficient revenue in excess of costs. At such time as the Company requires additional funding, the Company will seek to secure such best-efforts funding from various possible sources, including equity or debt financing, sales of assets, or collaborative arrangements. If the Company raises additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity, stockholders will experience dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of the holders of common stock or convertible senior notes. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing debt, the Company may be subject to limitations on its operations, through debt covenants or other restrictions. If the Company obtains additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or strategic partners, the Company may be required to relinquish its rights to certain technologies. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or raise them on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, it may be unable to execute its business plan, the Company could be required to curtail its operations, and the Company may not be able to pay off its obligations, if and when they come due.\nWe are currently taking initiatives to reduce our overall cash deficiencies on a monthly basis. During Fiscal Year 2023, certain members of our executive management team have taken a significant portion of their compensation in common stock to reduce the depletion of our available cash. To strengthen our business, we intend to adopt best practices from our recent acquisitions and invest in a marketing and sales strategy to grow our monthly recurring revenue; we anticipate utilizing our value-added resellers and channel partners to tap into new sources of revenue streams; and we have also secured numerous agent agreements through our recent acquisitions that we anticipate will accelerate revenue growth. In addition, we will continue to focus on selling a greater number of comprehensive services to our existing customer base. Further, in an effort to increase our revenues, we will continue to evaluate the acquisition of various assets with emphasis in VoIP Services and Cloud Communication Services. As a result, during the due diligence process we anticipate incurring significant legal and professional fees.\nWe have been successful in raising debt and equity capital in the past and as described in Notes 10, 11, and 12. We have financing efforts in place to continue to raise cash through debt and equity offerings. Although we have successfully completed financings and reduced expenses in the past, we cannot assure you that our plans to address these matters in the future will be successful.\nWe require cash to meet our interest payments to Post Road (as defined below), capital expenditure needs, and operational cash flow needs. The Company anticipates issuing additional equity or entering into additional Convertible Notes to secure the funding required to meet these cash needs. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or raise them on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to meet its interest payments, capital expenditures, and operational needs. As a result, the Company will be required to negotiate with its lender the terms of the current financing agreements, in addition to postponing the timing of deployment of its capital expenditures and extending the timing of the operational cash needs.\nIn November 2020, the Company and Verve Cloud, Inc. (a Nevada entity) (Verve Cloud) and Verve Clouds subsidiaries (Verve Cloud and its subsidiaries, collectively, the Verve Cloud Nevada Parties) entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Post Road Administrative LLC and its affiliate Post Road Special Opportunity Fund II LLP (collectively, Post Road). The Company is a party to certain sections of the Credit Agreement. Next Level Internet, Inc. became a Verve Cloud Nevada Party in February 2022.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and indemnification provisions. The Credit Agreement also contains affirmative and negative covenants with respect to the operation of the business and properties of the loan parties as well as financial performance.\nBelow are key financial covenant requirements, (measured quarterly) for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2023:\n\u25cf Maximum-Allowed - Senior Leverage Ratio of 3.55 to 1.00\n\u25cf Minimum-Allowed - EBITDA (on an annualized basis) of $4,394,867\n\u25cf Minimum-Allowed - Liquidity of $2,000,000\n\u25cf Maximum Allowed - Capital Expenditures of $94,798 (Quarterly)\n\u25cf Minimum-Allowed - Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.50 to 1.00\n\u25cf Maximum Allowed - Churn of 3.00% at any time\nAs of July 31, 2023, the Company was not in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. This noncompliance, together with certain other events of default that have occurred and are continuing under the Credit Agreement, resulted in our classifying the indebtedness under the Credit Agreement as a current liability.\nOn December 15, 2022, the lender agreed to forbear from exercising its remedies in connection with the financial covenants that were not complied with during the quarter ended October 31, 2022, as well as certain other specified defaults, until December 23, 2022.\nOn February 3, 2023, the Company, the Verve Cloud Nevada Parties (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements), and Post Road entered into a Consent, Limited Waiver and Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement and Amendment to the Notes (the Fourth Amendment). The Fourth Amendment is effective as of December 23, 2022. Among other things, the Fourth Amendment conditionally revises each of the six financial covenants set forth in Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement (related to maximum leverage, minimum liquidity, minimum EBITDA, maximum capital expenditures, minimum interest coverage (a provision that replaces the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio provision), and maximum churn). In addition, pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, none of the financial covenants contained in Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement, as amended by the Fourth Amendment, were to be tested as of the January 31, 2023 fiscal quarter end date so long as no events of default had occurred, other than minimum liquidity of $1,000,000, which was tested and met as of January 31, 2023. The Fourth Amendment provides that these revised financial covenants will be null and void if the Companys planned merger with MEOA does not close by February 28, 2023. On March 13, 2023, the Company, the Verve Cloud Nevada Parties, and Post Road entered into a Fifth Amendment of the Credit Agreement which extended the closing date of the planned merger to April 28, 2023.\nPursuant to the Fourth Amendment, Post Road agreed to conditionally waive each and all of the Specified Defaults (as defined in the Fourth Amendment).\nThe Fourth Amendment amends the Credit Agreement and the Notes to modify the interest rate payable by Verve Cloud.\nOn April 3, 2023, the Company, the Verve Cloud Nevada Parties, and Post Road entered into a Sixth Amendment to its Credit Agreement (the Sixth Amendment). Pursuant to the Sixth Amendment, Post Road agreed to increase the aggregate net unpaid principal amount (i.e., less original issue discounts and transaction costs paid in cash by Company upon the closing thereof and disclosed in writing to Post Road) the Company is allowed to borrow in the form of convertible loans to $3,500,000. This amount was increased from the $3,000,000 agreed to by Post Road pursuant to the Fourth Amendment.\nPursuant to the Sixth Amendment, Post Road agreed to defer the cash interest otherwise due and payable on April 1, 2023 to the May 1, 2023 payment date.\nOn May 1, 2023, the Company, the Verve Cloud Nevada Parties, and Post Road entered into a Seventh Amendment to Credit Agreement (the Seventh Amendment). The Seventh Amendment is dated as of May 1, 2023, with an effective date of April 28, 2023. Pursuant to the Seventh Amendment, the planned merger closing date was amended to May 31, 2023, or such later date as agreed to in writing by Post Road in its sole discretion. On June 15, 2023, the planned merger with MEOA was terminated.\nThe Seventh Amendment also modified the negative covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement to add a new section on material nonpublic information (MNPI).

If Post Road elects to receive the notice of MNPI, the Company shall deliver such notice in accordance with the Credit Agreement, and if Post Road elects not to receive such notice, the Company shall not deliver the notice and Post Road shall have waived its rights to receive delivery of the notice. Any election by Post Road to waive their right to receive delivery of any notice of MNPI applies only with respect to the specific notice and not to any subsequent notice.\nOn August 16, 2023, the Company, the Verve Cloud Nevada Parties, and Post Road entered into the Letter Agreement to the Credit Agreement (the Letter Agreement), with an effective date of August 4, 2023 (the Effective Date).

The current tax year is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and certain state taxing authorities. As of July 31, 2023, Digerati had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $42,554,098 to reduce future federal income tax liabilities; net loss from 2018 and on will be carryforward indefinitely, the net loss carryforwards prior to 2018 started expiring in 2021. Under the enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the new effective Corporate flat tax rate is 21% (effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017). Income tax benefit (provision) for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\nThe effective tax rate for Digerati is reconciled to statutory rates as follows:\nExpected Federal benefit (provision), at statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 %\nChange in valuation allowance (21.0 )% (21.0 )%\n0.0 % 0.0 %\nDeferred tax assets are comprised of the following as of July 31, 2023 and 2022:\nNet operating loss carryover $ 8,936,361 $ 5,534,915\nValuation allowance (8,936,361 ) (5,534,915 )\nTotal deferred tax asset, net $ -\n$ -\nThe change in the valuation allowance for 2023 resulted in an increase of approximately $3,401,446. Management has evaluated and concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in Digeratis consolidated financial statements. The current year remains open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions in which Digerati is subject to tax. The Company files a calendar year return, and the net operating loss was adjusted for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023.\nThe federal and state net operating losses (NOLs) may be subject to certain limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which could significantly restrict the Companys ability to use the NOLs to offset taxable income in subsequent years.\nWe record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluate on new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available.\nNOTE 6 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nIn November 2015, the Company adopted the Digerati Technologies, Inc. 2015 Equity Compensation Plan (the Plan). On May 25, 2023, the Company amended The Plan which now authorizes the grant of up to 15 million (previously 7.5 million) stock options, restricted common shares, non-restricted common shares and other awards to employees, directors, and certain other persons. The Plan is intended to permit the Company to retain and attract qualified individuals who will contribute to the overall success of the Company. The Companys Board of Directors determines the terms of any grants under the Plan. Exercise prices of all stock options and other awards vary based on the market price of the shares of common stock as of the date of grant. The stock options, restricted common stock, non-restricted common stock, and other awards vest based on the terms of the individual grant.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company extended the expiration date on 3,460,000 previously issued stock options to various employees until December 1, 2027; the exercise price of these options was amended to $0.095 per share; and these options also vested immediately on June 1, 2023. The modification of these stock options created a stock-based compensation expense of $248,820 to the Company. On July 24, 2023, the exercise price on these options was amended to $0.032 per share. The modification to the exercise price resulted in an additional $6,618 stock-based compensation expense to the Company for the 3,460,000 modified options. Additionally, the Company issued 5,895,000 new stock options to certain Company Executives and Board Members, which had an immediate vesting date of June 1, 2023; an expiration date of December 1, 2027; and an exercise price of $0.095 per share. These newly issued options generated a stock-based compensation expense of $522,716 to the Company. On July 24, 2023, the exercise price of these 5,895,000 options was amended to $0.032 per share. The modification to the exercise price resulted in an additional $11,275 stock-based compensation expense to the Company for the newly issued 5,895,000 options.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company extended the expiration date on 1,150,000 previously issued stock options to various employees until July 31, 2025, and the exercise price of these options was set at $0.11 per share. The modification of these stock options created a nominal expense to the Company.\nThe fair market value of all options issued and modified during the year ended July 31, 2023, were determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which used the following assumptions below. We did not issue any options during the year ended July 31, 2022.\nExpected dividend yield 0.00%\nExpected stock price volatility 156.79% - 157.45%\nRisk-free interest rate 3.90% - 4.13%\nExpected term 4.5 years\nDigerati recognized approximately $881,000 and $98,000 in stock-based compensation expense to employees during the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Unamortized compensation cost totaled $5,736 and $97,972 at July 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively.\nThe following is a summary of the stock option activity under the Plan as of July 31, 2023, and the changes during Fiscal Years 2023 and 2022:\nWeighted-\naverage\nexercise Weighted-\naverage\nremaining\ncontractual\nOptions price term (years)\nOutstanding at July 31, 2021 9,230,000 $ 0.17 2.93\nGranted -\n-\n-\nExercised -\n-\n-\nForfeited and cancelled (100,000 ) $ 0.25 -\nOutstanding at July 31, 2022 9,130,000 $ 0.17 2.93\nGranted 5,895,000 $ 0.03 4.40\nExercised (1,180,000 ) $ 0.04 -\nForfeited and cancelled (40,000 ) $ 0.45 -\nOutstanding at July 31, 2023 13,805,000 $ 0.05 3.68\nExercisable at July 31, 2023 13,519,606 $ 0.05 3.70\nThe aggregate intrinsic value (the difference between the Companys closing stock price on the last trading day of the period and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) of the 13,805,000 and 9,130,000 stock options outstanding at July 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022 was $28,065 and $191,722, respectively.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of the 13,519,606 and 7,551,179 stock options exercisable at July 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022 was $28,065 and $110,380, respectively.\nNOTE 7 - WARRANTS\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company issued 14,741,721 warrants under promissory notes and 2,500,000 warrants for extension of promissory note in which the warrants vested at the time of issuance.

The Warrant has an exercise price of $0.01 per share and the Warrant expires on November 17, 2030. Seventy-five percent (75%) of the Warrant Shares are immediately fully vested and not subject to forfeiture at any time for any reason. The remaining twenty-five percent (25%) of the Warrant Shares are subject to forfeiture based on the Company achieving certain performance targets which, if achieved, would result in twenty percent (20%) warrant coverage. If the minority shareholders of T3 Nevada convert their T3 Nevada shares into shares of the Companys common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the common stock), the Warrant Shares percentage shall also be lowered such that when combined with the achievement of the performance targets, the warrant coverage could be reduced to fifteen percent (15%).\nIn connection with the issuance of the Warrant, the three executives of the Company, Art Smith, Antonio Estrada, and Craig Clement entered into a Tag-Along Agreement (the Tag-Along Agreement) whereby they agreed that the holder of the Warrant or Warrant Share will have the right to participate or tag-along in any agreements to sell any shares of their common stock that such executives enter into.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nIn accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of July 31, 2023.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Companys Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u25cf Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\n\u25cf Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\n\u25cf Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\nAs of July 31, 2023, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that, as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report; such internal controls and procedures were not effective based on the COSO criteria. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.\nThe matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses were:\n1. We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. We lack multiple levels of review over financial reporting. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that the controls deficiency and lack of multiple levels of review over financial reporting represented a material weakness.\nThe aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in connection with the review of our internal statements as of July 31, 2023.\nManagements Remediation Initiatives\nIn an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated the following:\n(1) We have created specific titles and established specific roles for each of our accounting and finance team members which will allow for a segregation of duties consistent with controls objectives and to increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function. In addition, we intend to improve the supervision and training of our accounting personnel.\n(2) We intend to enact a dual level of review of our financial reporting to ensure the accuracy of our financial statements within a fair level of materiality.\nWe are continuing our efforts to improve and strengthen our control processes and procedures to fully remedy these deficiencies. Our management and directors will continue to work with our auditors and other outside advisors to ensure that our controls and procedures are adequate and effective.\nThe Company is not required by current SEC rules to include and does not include an auditors attestation report. The Companys registered public accounting firm has not attested to managements reports on the Companys internal control over financial reporting.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nExcept as described above, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended July 31, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION.\nSecond Forbearance Agreement, Amendment to Loan Documents and Limited Consent\nOn November 22, 2023 (with effect from November 2, 2023), the Verve Cloud Nevada Parties, Digerati and Post Road entered into a Second Forbearance Agreement, Amendment to Loan Documents and Limited Consent (the Second Forbearance Agreement), which (a) extends the maturity date of our Term Loan C Note with Post Road from November 2, 2023, to December 31, 2023, (b) provides that Post Road and the other lenders under the Credit Agreement shall forbear through December 31, 2023 from exercising their rights and remedies under the loan documents and applicable law with respect to (i) certain existing events of default under the loan documents and (ii) certain events of default that are expected to arise before December 31, 2023 (collectively, the Specified Defaults), and (c) amends certain provisions of the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents to allow the Company to incur up to an additional $2,000,000 of working capital financing.\nThe Specified Defaults under the Second Forbearance Agreement include (a) existing events of default arising as a result of the Verve Cloud Nevada Parties failing to comply with the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement and certain operating and reporting covenants under the Credit Agreement and other loan documents (including as a result of incurring certain indebtedness that the loan documents did not permit and failure to provide notice to Post Road of certain entity name changes), (b) the previously disclosed existing events of default (all of which remain outstanding and unwaived) that were the subject of the Forbearance Agreement and Third Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of June 13, 2022, among the Verve Cloud Nevada Parties, the lenders party thereto and Post Road, and the Consent, Limited Waiver and Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement and Amendment to Notes, dated as of February 9, 2023, among the Verve Cloud Nevada Parties, the lenders party thereto and Post Road and (c) events of default that are expected to arise between the date of the Second Forbearance Agreement and December 31, 2023 (including noncompliance with financial covenants and certain reporting requirements).\nThe forbearance provided under the Second Forbearance Agreement will expire on the earliest to occur of (a) December 31, 2023, (b) any other event of default not constituting a Specified Default enumerated in the Forbearance Agreement or (c) any failure of any Verve Cloud Nevada Party or Digerati to comply with any aspect of the Second Forbearance Agreement. The Second Forbearance Agreement does not waive the Specified Defaults nor does it impair the ability of Post Road to exercise its rights and remedies after the expiration of the forbearance. After the expiration of the forbearance provided under the Second Forbearance Agreement, Post Road will be immediately entitled to exercise any and all rights and remedies it has under the loan documents and applicable law, including the right to foreclose on some or all of our assets.\nAs a condition to entering into the Second Forbearance Agreement, Digerati entered into extension and forbearance agreements with the holders of our convertible notes providing that the maturity date of all outstanding amounts thereunder are extended through December 31, 2023, and that such holders agree to forbear from exercising their rights and remedies under the convertible notes and applicable law through December 31, 2023. These agreements are described below under Extension and Forbearance Agreements with Holders of Convertible Notes.\nWith the extension of the maturity date of our Term Loan C Note payable to Post Road from November 2, 2023, to December 31, 2023, the Term Loan C Note will require a full principal payment and accrued interest by the maturity date. We intend to work with our equity partners to secure additional financings to meet this obligation by the maturity date. In addition, we intend to work with our lender on the current terms to the Term Loan C Note, to further extend the maturity date or restructure the terms of the note. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or raise them on acceptable terms to meet the cash payment requirements of the Term Loan C Note. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to restructure the terms or further extend the maturity date of the Term Loan C Note with Post Road. If the Company is not able to restructure the financing or repay the Term Loan C Note by the December 31, 2023 maturity date and Post Road chooses to exercise its rights and remedies under the loan documents, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, including the possibility of Post Road foreclosing on some or all of our assets.\nThe foregoing summary of the Second Forbearance Agreement contains only a brief description of the material terms of the Second Forbearance Agreement and such description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Second Forbearance Agreement, filed herewith as Exhibit 10.44 and incorporated by reference herein.\nExtension and Forbearance Agreements with Holders of Convertible Notes\nAs a condition to entering into the Second Forbearance Agreement, Digerati entered into an Extension and Forbearance Agreement, each dated as of November 22, 2023, with each holder of its convertible notes. Each holders Extension and Forbearance Agreement is identical in all material respects to the Extension and Forbearance Agreements of each other holder. Under the Extension and Forbearance Agreements, each holder of a convertible note agreed that (a) all payments otherwise due and payable under such convertible note prior to December 31, 2023 would, instead, be due and payable on December 31, 2023, and (b) such holder will forbear from exercising its rights and remedies under its convertible notes and applicable law with respect to all existing defaults as of November 22, 2023, and certain future defaults expected to arise prior to December 31, 2023, through December 31, 2023.\nThe Extension and Forbearance Agreements do not waive any existing defaults nor do they impair the ability of any holder of a convertible note to exercise its rights and remedies after the expiration of the forbearance. After the expiration of the forbearance provided under each Extension and Forbearance Agreement, the holder of the applicable convertible note will be immediately entitled to exercise any and all rights and remedies it has under its note and applicable law.\nThe foregoing summary of each Extension and Forbearance Agreement contains only a brief description of the material terms of each Extension and Forbearance Agreement and such description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Form of Extension and Forbearance Agreement, filed herewith as Exhibit 10.45 and incorporated by reference herein.\nITEM 9C.

Our Board of Directors maintains decision-making authority with respect to these executive compensation matters.\nOur Board of Directors reviews the recommendations of our management with respect to total executive compensation and each element of compensation when making pay decisions. In allocating compensation among compensation elements, we emphasize incentive, not fixed compensation to ensure that executives only receive superior pay for superior results. We equally value short- and long-term compensation because both short- and long-term results are critical to our success. In addition, our compensation program includes various benefits provided to all employees, including life insurance, health insurance and other customary benefits. The objectives and details of why each element of compensation is paid are described below.\nBase Salary. Our objective for paying base salaries to executives is to reward them for performing the core responsibilities of their positions and to provide a level of security with respect to a portion of their compensation. We consider a number of factors when setting base salaries for executives, including:\n\u25cf Existing salary levels;\n\u25cf Competitive pay practices;\n\u25cf Individual and corporate performance; and\n\u25cf Internal equity among our executives, taking into consideration their relative contributions to our success.\nAnnual Performance-Based Cash Bonus. Executives are eligible to receive annual performance-based cash bonuses such as incentive bonuses that are based on achieving specific metrics such as reaching certain revenue levels, increased EBITDA by the Company, and Management Bonus Objectives (MBO) goals. These bonuses are approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.\nLong-term Incentive Awards. We award long-term incentive compensation to focus our executives on our long-term growth and stockholder return, as well as to encourage our executives to remain with us for the long-term. Long-term incentive awards are primarily in the form of grants of stock options and/or stock award pursuant to our 2015 Equity Compensation Plan (the Plan). We selected this form because of the favorable accounting and tax treatment and the expectation of key employees in our industry that they would receive stock options and/or stock grants. We do not have pre-established target award amounts for long-term incentive grants. In determining long-term incentive awards for the Named Executive Officers, our Board of Directors relies on recommendations from our Chief Executive Officer, who considers the individual performance of the executives, the relation of the award to base salary and annual incentive compensation and associated accounting expense. The terms of and amount of awards are made by our Board of Directors in accordance with the 2015 Stock Option Plan.\nNon-Standardized Profit-Sharing Plan. We currently provide a Non-Standardized Profit-Sharing Plan, adopted September 15, 2006. Under the plan our employees qualify to participate in the plan after one year of employment. Contributions under the plan are based on 25% of the annual base salary of each eligible employee up to $54,000 per year. Contributions under the plan are fully vested upon funding.\nExecutive Compensation\nThe following table sets forth the compensation paid to each of our principal executive officer and our other two most highly compensated executive officers (the Named Executive Officers) during the last two completed fiscal years:\nSUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE\nName and Principal Position Year Salary\n($) Bonus\n($) Stock\nAwards\n($) Option\nAwards\n($) (1) Non-Equity\nIncentive Plan\nCompensation\n($) (2)\nTotal\n($)\nArthur L.

Grants may be in the form of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock awards, and/or unrestricted stock awards. The number and terms of each award is determined by the Board of Directors, subject to the limitation that the exercise price of any option may not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant.\nWe currently provide a Non-Standardized Profit-Sharing Plan (the Profit-Sharing Plan). The Board of Directors approved the Profit-Sharing Plan on September 15, 2006. Under the Profit-Sharing Plan our employees qualified to participate in the Profit-Sharing Plan after one year of employment.

The 107,701,179 warrant shares that PRG Fund reported it owned in the Schedule 13D it filed on November 27, 2020 (as amended on March 17, 2021 to reflect a transfer of 24.32% of the warrant to the PRF Offshore Fund as a result of which a new warrant was issued (the New Warrant) for the other 75.68% of the original warrant and as amended on July 13, 2021 to reflect a transfer of 13.19% of the New Warrant to the PRF Offshore Fund; the PRG Fund owns a warrant for 65.7% of the original amount and the PRF Offshore Fund owns a warrant for 34.3% of the original amount) represents twenty-five percent (25%) of the total shares of common stock, calculated on a fully diluted basis, which assumes future share issuances that are not certain or not yet contractually obligated to be issued. In addition, twenty-five percent (25%) of the 107,701,179 warrant shares are not yet vested and subject to forfeiture if the Company achieves certain performance targets which, if achieved, would result in the warrant being exercisable into twenty percent (20%) of the common stock, calculated on a fully-diluted basis as described above. If the minority stockholders of T3 Nevada convert their T3 Nevada shares into shares of the common stock, the number of shares into which the warrant may be exercised would also be decreased such that, if the Company also achieves certain performance targets, the warrant would be exercisable into fifteen percent (15%) of the common stock, calculated on a fully-diluted basis as described above. T3 Nevadas minority stockholders have an obligation to (and may not otherwise) convert their T3 Nevada shares into shares of the common stock upon being asked to do so by the Company at any time after our common stock has a current market price of $1.50 or more per share for 20 consecutive trading days.\n(2) Based on 161,921,685 shares of common stock outstanding, 11,746,971 vested stock options, and 45,952,758 vested warrants as of October 10, 2023.\n(3) Holders of the Series F Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote on all matters subject to a vote or written consent of the holders of the Corporations common stock, and on all such matters, the shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall be entitled to that number of votes equal to the number of votes that all issued and outstanding shares of common stock and all other securities of the Corporation are entitled to, as of any such date of determination, on a fully diluted basis, plus one million (1,000,000) votes.\n(4) Total votes excludes 11,746,971 vested stock options and 45,952,758 vested warrants as of October 10, 2023. ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.\nFor a director to be considered independent according to the standards set forth in Section 303A.02 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual (the NYSE Manual), the Board of Directors must affirmatively determine that the director has no material relationship with Digerati, either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Digerati. In addition, the NYSE Manual provides that a director will not be considered independent if, within the preceding three years, the director or an immediate family member (i) was an employee of Digerati, (ii) received more than $120,000 per year in direct compensation from Digerati, (iii) is affiliated with or employed by a present or former internal or external auditor of Digerati, (iv) employed as an executive officer of another company for which an executive officer of Digerati serves on the compensation committee or (v) is an executive officer or employee that makes payments to or receives payments from Digerati of more than $1,000,000 or two percent of such other companys gross revenues.\nOur Board of Directors has determined that Digerati is a controlled company under NYSE rules because more than 50% of our voting stock is held by management. As a controlled company, we are not required to have majority of independent directors, a fully independent nomination committee, or a fully independent compensation committee. Digerati takes advantage of these exemptions.\nThe Board has determined that Mr. Maxwell A. Polinsky satisfies the independence requirements in the NYSE Manual because the Board affirmatively determined that he has no material relationship with the Company, either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company.\nTransactions with Related Persons. Since the beginning of the Companys last fiscal year, there have been no transactions between the Company and any related persons in which the amount involved exceed the lesser of $120,000, or 1%, of the average of the Companys total assets at fiscal year end for the last two completed fiscal years, except as disclosed below. ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.\nAudit Committee Policy Regarding Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nOur Board of Directors (Mr. Polinsky serves as the Audit Committee Financial Expert) who performs all the functions of the audit committee has established a policy that generally requires that all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the Companys independent registered public accounting firm be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. From the time that the pre-approval requirements became effective, all permissible non-audit services provided by the Companys independent registered public accounting firm have been pre-approved by the Companys Audit Committee. Our Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of services under the heading All Other Fees is compatible with maintaining the accountants independence and determined that it is consistent with such independence.\nIn connection with the audit of the 2023 financial statements, the Company entered into an engagement agreement with MaloneBailey, LLP (MaloneBailey) which sets forth the terms by which MaloneBailey will perform audit services for the Company.\nThe fees listed in the table below under Audit Fees represent fees billed by MaloneBailey for services provided to the Company in connection with the audits of our financial statements for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, reviews of the financial statements included in each of our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and services that are normally provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements during those years.
