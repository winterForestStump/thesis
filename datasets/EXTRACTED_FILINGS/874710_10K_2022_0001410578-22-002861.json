    "content": "Item 1. Business\nGeneral\nAllied Healthcare Products, Inc. (Allied, the Company, we, or us) manufactures a variety of respiratory products used in the health care industry in a wide range of hospital and alternate site settings, including sub-acute care facilities, home health care and emergency medical care. The Companys product lines include respiratory care products, medical gas equipment and emergency medical products.\nThe Companys products are marketed under well-recognized and respected brand names to hospitals, hospital equipment dealers, hospital construction contractors, home health care dealers, emergency medical products dealers and others. Allieds product lines include:\nRespiratory Care Products\n\u25cf respiratory care/anesthesia products\n\u25cf home respiratory care products\nMedical Gas Equipment\n\u25cf medical gas system construction products\n\u25cf medical gas system regulation devices\n\u25cf disposable oxygen and specialty gas cylinders\n\u25cf portable suction equipment\nEmergency Medical Products\n\u25cf respiratory/resuscitation products\n\u25cf trauma and patient handling products\nThe Companys principal executive offices are located at 1720 Sublette Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, and its telephone number is (314) 771-2400.\nMarkets and Products\nIn fiscal 2022, respiratory care products, medical gas equipment and emergency medical products represented approximately 30%, 50% and 20%, respectively, of the Companys net sales. In comparison, in fiscal 2021, respiratory care products, medical gas equipment and emergency medical products represented approximately 22%, 44%, and 34%, respectively, of the Companys net sales. The Company operates in a single industry segment and its principal products are described in the following table:\nPrincipal\nProduct\nDescription\nBrand Names\nPrimary Users\nRespiratory Care Products\nRespiratory Care/Anesthesia Products\nLarge volume compressors; ventilator calibrators; humidifiers and mist tents; and carbon dioxide absorbent\nTimeter\u00ae; Carbolime\u00ae; Litholyme\u00ae\nHospitals and sub-acute facilities\nHome Respiratory Care Products\nO2 cylinders; pressure regulators; nebulizers; portable large volume compressors; portable suction equipment and disposable respiratory products\nTimeter\u00ae; B&F\u00ae; Schuco\u00ae\nPatients at home\nMedical Gas Equipment\nConstruction Products\nIn-wall medical gas system components; central station pumps and compressors and headwalls\nChemetron\u00ae; Oxequip\u00ae\nHospitals and sub-acute facilities\nRegulation Devices\nFlowmeters; vacuum regulators; pressure regulators and related products\nChemetron\u00ae; Oxequip\u00ae; Timeter\u00ae\nHospitals and sub-acute facilities\nDisposable Cylinders\nDisposable oxygen and gas cylinders\nLif-O-Gen\u00ae\nFirst aid providers and specialty gas distributors\nSuction Equipment\nPortable suction equipment and disposable suction canisters\nGomco\u00ae; Allied; Schuco\nHospitals, sub-acute facilities and homecare products\nEmergency Medical Products\nRespiratory/Resuscitation\nDemand resuscitation valves; bag mask resuscitators; emergency transport ventilators, oxygen regulators, SurgeX - surge suppressing post valve, mass casualty ventilation line, and the AHP300 Ventilator\nLSP; Omni-Tech\u00ae; Allied\nEmergency service providers\nTrauma and Patient Handling Products\nSpine immobilization products; pneumatic anti-shock garments, trauma burn kits and Xtra backboards\nLSP\nEmergency service providers\nRespiratory Care Products\nMarket. Respiratory care products are used in the treatment of acute and chronic respiratory disorders such as asthma, emphysema, bronchitis and pneumonia. Respiratory care products are used in both hospitals and alternate care settings. Sales of respiratory care products are made through distribution channels focusing on hospitals and other sub-acute facilities. Sales of home respiratory care products are made through durable medical equipment dealers through telemarketing, and by contract sales with national chains.\nRespiratory Care/Anesthesia Products. The Company manufactures and sells a broad range of products for use in respiratory care and anesthesia delivery, including carbon dioxide absorbents. These products include large volume air compressors, calibration equipment, humidifiers, croup tents, equipment dryers and a complete line of respiratory disposable products such as oxygen tubing, facemasks, cannulas and ventilator circuits.\nHome Respiratory Care Products. Allieds broad line of home respiratory care products include aluminum oxygen cylinders, oxygen regulators, pneumatic nebulizers, portable suction equipment and a full line of respiratory disposable products.\nMedical Gas Equipment\nMarket. The market for medical gas equipment consists of hospitals, alternate care settings and surgery centers. The medical gas equipment group is broken down into three separate categories: construction products, regulation devices and suction equipment, and disposable cylinders.\nConstruction Products. Allieds medical gas system construction products consist of in-wall medical system components, central station pumps and compressors, and headwalls. These products are typically installed during construction or renovation of a health care facility and are built in as an integral part of the facilitys physical plant. Typically, the contractor for the facilitys construction or renovation purchases medical gas system components from manufacturers and ensures that the design specifications of the health care facility are met.\nAllieds in-wall components, including outlets, manifolds, alarms, ceiling columns and zone valves, serve a fundamental role in medical gas delivery systems.\nCentral station pumps and compressors are individually engineered systems consisting of compressors, reservoirs, valves and controls designed to drive a hospitals medical gas and suction systems. Each system is designed specifically for a given hospital or facility, which purchases pumps and compressors from suppliers. The Companys sales of pumps and compressors are driven, in large part, by its share of the in-wall components market.\nThe Companys construction products are sold primarily to hospitals, alternate care settings and hospital construction contractors. The Company believes that these products are installed in more than three thousand hospitals in the United States. The Company believes that most hospitals and sub-acute care facility construction spending is for expansion or renovation of existing facilities. Many hospital systems and individual hospitals undertake major renovations to upgrade their operations to improve the quality of care they provide, reduce costs and attract patients and personnel.\nRegulation Devices and Suction Equipment. The Companys medical gas system regulation products include flowmeters, vacuum regulators and pressure regulators, as well as related adapters, fittings and hoses which measure, regulate, monitor and help transfer medical gases from walled piping or equipment to patients in hospital rooms, operating theaters or intensive care areas.\nPortable suction equipment is typically used when in-wall suction is not available or when medical protocol specifically requires portable suction. The Company also manufactures disposable suction canisters, which are clear containers used to collect the fluids suctioned by in-wall or portable suction systems. The containers have volume calibrations, which allow the medical practitioner to measure the volume of fluids suctioned.\nThe market for regulation devices and suction equipment includes hospital and sub-acute care facilities. Sales of these products are made through the same distribution channel as our respiratory care products. The Company believes that it holds a significant share of the U.S. market in both regulation devices and suction equipment.\nDisposable Cylinders. Disposable oxygen cylinders are designed to provide oxygen for short periods of time in emergency situations. Since they are not subjected to the same pressurization as standard containers, they are much lighter and less expensive than standard gas cylinders. The Company markets filled disposable oxygen cylinders through industrial safety distributors and similar customers, principally to first aid providers, restaurants, industrial plants and other customers that require oxygen for infrequent emergencies.\nEmergency Medical Products\nMarket. Emergency medical products are used in the treatment of trauma-induced injuries. The Companys emergency medical products provide patient resuscitation or ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation or respiratory distress as well as immobilization and treatment for burns. The Company expects that additional countries will develop trauma care systems in the future, although no assurance can be given that such systems will develop or that they will have a favorable impact on the Company. Sales of emergency medical products are made through specialized emergency medical products distributors to ambulance companies, fire departments and emergency medical systems volunteer organizations.\nThe emergency medical products are broken down into two categories: respiratory/resuscitator products and trauma patient handling products.\nRespiratory/Resuscitation Products. The Companys respiratory/resuscitation products include demand resuscitation valves, portable resuscitation systems, bag masks and related products, emergency transport ventilators, precision oxygen regulators, minilators, multilators and humidifiers.\nDemand resuscitation valves are designed to provide 100% oxygen to breathing or non-breathing patients. In an emergency situation they can be used with a mask or tracheotomy tubes and operate from a standard regulated oxygen system. The Companys portable resuscitation systems provide fast, simple and effective means of ventilating a non-breathing patient during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 100% oxygen to breathing patients on demand with minimal inspiratory effort. The Company also markets a full line of disposable and reusable bag mask resuscitators, which are available in a variety of adult and child-size configurations. Disposable mouth-to-mask resuscitation systems have the added advantage of reducing the risk of transmission of communicable diseases.\nThe Companys autovent transport ventilator can meet a variety of needs in different applications ranging from typical emergency medical situations to more sophisticated air and ground transport. Each autovent is accompanied by a patient valve, which provides effective ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation or respiratory distress. When administration of oxygen is required at the scene of a disaster, in military field hospitals or in a multiple-victim incident, Allieds minilators and multilators are capable of providing oxygen to one or a large number of patients.\nThe Companys transport and mass casualty ventilation line has been designed to meet the unique ventilation demands that affect everyday inter-hospital and intra-hospital transport scenarios, and amplify exponentially during a mass casualty event or pandemic. Our ventilators for transport and mass casualty are rugged, easy to operate, and capable of providing reliable ventilation even in unpredictable environments and conditions. Additionally, they are affordable to purchase and require little periodic maintenance, minimizing the cost of ownership over time.\nTo complement the family of respiratory/resuscitation products, the Company offers a full line of oxygen product accessories. This line of accessory products includes reusable aspirators, tru-fit masks, disposable cuffed masks and related accessories.\nTrauma and Patient Handling Products. The Companys trauma and patient handling products include spine immobilization products, pneumatic anti-shock garments and trauma burn kits. Spine immobilization products include a backboard that is designed for safe immobilization of injury victims and provides a durable and cost effective means of emergency patient transportation and extrication. The infant/pediatric immobilization board is durable and scaled for children. The half back extractor/rescue vest is useful for both suspected cervical/spinal injuries and for mountain and air rescues. The Companys pneumatic anti-shock garments are used to treat victims experiencing hypovolemic shock. Allieds trauma burn kits contain a comprehensive line of products for the treatment of trauma and burns.\nSales and Marketing\nAllied sells its products primarily to hospitals, hospital equipment dealers, hospital construction contractors, home health care dealers, emergency medical products dealers and others. The Company maintains a sales force of 9 sales professionals, all of whom are full-time employees of the Company.\nThe sales force includes three domestic hospital, homecare and emergency specialists, three domestic construction specialists, and two international sales representatives. One sales manager leads the sales groups.\nThe domestic hospital specialists are responsible for sales of all Allied products with the exception of construction products within their territory. Sales of hospital products are accomplished through respiratory care/anesthesia distributors for the regulation devices, suction equipment, respiratory care/anesthesia products and disposable cylinders. The domestic construction specialists are responsible for sales of all Allied construction products within their territory. Emergency products are principally sold to ambulance companies, fire departments and emergency medical systems volunteer organizations through specialized emergency medical products distributors.\nConstruction products are sold direct to hospital construction contractors and through distributors.\nThe Companys international specialists sell all Allied products within their territory. Allieds net sales to foreign markets totaled 24% of total net sales in fiscal 2022, 33% in 2021 and 27% in 2020. International sales are made through a network of dealers, agents and U.S. exporters who distribute the Companys products throughout the world. Allied has market presence in Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, Europe, the Middle East and the Far East.\nManufacturing\nAllieds manufacturing processes include fabrication, electro-mechanical assembly operations, plastics manufacturing, and chemical processing with automated packaging. A significant part of Allieds manufacturing operations involves electro-mechanical assembly of proprietary products and the Company is vertically integrated in most elements of metal machining and fabrication. Most of Allieds hourly employees are involved in machining, metal fabrication, plastics manufacturing and product assembly.\nAllied manufactures small metal components from bar stock in a machine shop, which includes automatic screw machines, horizontal lathes and drill presses and computer controlled machining centers. The Company makes larger metal components from sheet metal using computerized punch presses, brake presses and shears. In its plastics manufacturing processes, the Company utilizes both extrusion and injection molding. In its chemical process, the Company utilizes mixing, drying, and sizing equipment. The Company believes that its production facilities and equipment are in good condition and sufficient to meet budgeted sales volume over the next few years, provided that the Company has sufficient labor and supply of raw materials and components. In fiscal 2022 the market for the skilled manufacturing employees critical to the Companys production was extremely tight. The Company expects this tight labor market condition to continue in fiscal 2023.\nResearch and Development\nAllied Healthcare Products research and development group is responsible for the development of new products. This group is staffed with mechanical and electrical engineers.\nDuring fiscal year 2022 the research and development group supported production of our main product lines.\nGovernment Regulation\nThe Companys products and its manufacturing activities are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation by federal and state authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, medical devices for human use are subject to comprehensive review by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the FDA). The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act), and other federal statutes and regulations, govern or influence the research, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of such products. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in warning letters, fines, recall or seizure of products, injunction, refusal to permit products to be imported into or exported out of the United States, refusal of the government to clear or approve marketing applications or to allow the Company to enter into government supply contracts, or withdrawal of previously approved marketing applications and criminal prosecution.\nThe Company is required to file a premarket notification in the form of a premarket approval (PMA) with the FDA before it begins marketing a new medical device that offers new technology that is currently not on the market. The Company also must file a premarket notification in the form of a 510(k) with the FDA before it begins marketing a new medical device that utilizes existing technology for devices that are currently on the market. The 510(k) submission process is also required when the Company makes a change or modifies an existing device in a manner that could significantly affect the devices safety or effectiveness.\nCompliance with the regulatory approval process in order to market a new or modified medical device can be uncertain, lengthy and, in some cases, expensive. There can be no assurance that necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained on a timely basis, or at all. Delays in receipt or failure to receive such approvals, the loss of previously received approvals, or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company manufactures and distributes a broad spectrum of respiratory therapy equipment, emergency medical equipment and medical gas equipment. To date, all of the Companys FDA clearances have been obtained through the 510(k) clearance process. These determinations are very fact specific and the FDA has stated that, initially, the manufacturer is best qualified to make these determinations, which should be based on adequate supporting data and documentation. The FDA, however, may disagree with a manufacturers determination not to file a 510(k) and require the submission of a new 510(k) notification for the changed or modified device. Where the FDA believes that the change or modification raises significant new questions of safety or effectiveness, the agency may require a manufacturer to cease distribution of the device pending clearance of a new 510(k) notification. Certain of the Companys medical devices have been changed or modified subsequent to 510(k) marketing clearance of the original device by the FDA. Certain of the Companys medical devices, which were first marketed prior to May 28, 1976, and therefore, grandfathered and exempt from the 510(k) notification process, also have been subsequently changed or modified. The Company believes that these changes or modifications do not significantly affect the devices safety or effectiveness or make a major change or modification in the devices intended uses and, accordingly, submission of new 510(k) notification to the FDA is not required. There can be no assurance, however, that the FDA would agree with the Companys determinations.\nIn addition, commercial distribution in certain foreign countries is subject to additional regulatory requirements and receipt of approvals that vary widely from country to country. The Company believes it is in compliance with regulatory requirements of the countries in which it sells its products.\nThe Medical Device Reporting regulation requires that the Company provide information to the FDA on deaths or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of its devices, as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. The Medical Device Tracking regulation requires the Company to adopt a method of device tracking of certain devices, such as ventilators, which are life-supporting or life-sustaining devices used outside of a device user facility, some of which are permanently implantable devices. The regulation requires that the method adopted by the Company will ensure that the tracked device can be traced from the device manufacturer to the person for whom the device is indicated (i.e., the patient). In addition, the FDA prohibits a company from promoting an approved device for unapproved applications and reviews a companys labeling for accuracy. Labeling and promotional activities also are in certain instances, subject to scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission.\nThe Companys medical device manufacturing facilities in St. Louis, MO and Stuyvesant Falls, NY are registered with the FDA. The Company has received ISO 13485:2016 MDSAP certification, however it lapsed in fiscal year 2022. The Company has completed all the necessary audits and expect the Certificate to be re-issued early in fiscal year 2023. The Company is subject to audit by the FDA, International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and European auditors for compliance with the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), the ISO, and CMDCAS, regulations for medical devices. These regulations require the Company to manufacture its products and maintain its products and documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to design, manufacturing, testing and control activities. The Company also is subject to the registration and inspection requirements of state regulatory agencies.\nThere can be no assurance that any required FDA or other governmental approval will be granted, or, if granted, will not be withdrawn. Governmental regulation may prevent or substantially delay the marketing of the Companys proposed products and cause the Company to undertake costly procedures. In addition, the extent of potentially adverse government regulation that might arise from future administrative action or legislation cannot be predicted. Any failure to obtain, and maintain, such approvals could adversely affect the Companys ability to market its products or proposed products.\nSales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. FDA approval may be required under certain circumstances to export certain medical devices.\nThe Company is also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protections, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances.\nPatents, Trademarks and Proprietary Technology\nThe company owns and maintains domestic and foreign patents on several products it believes are useful to the business and provided the Company with an advantage over its competitors. The company continues to seek U.S. and foreign patents on the EPV200 and AHP300 ventilators.\nPatents which will expire in the period of 2022 to 2036 in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of Allieds business. Allied believes no single patent, except that related to Litholyme\u00ae, is material in relation to Allieds future business as a whole. Although the expiration of an individual patent may lead to increased competition, other factors such as a competitors need to obtain regulatory approvals prior to marketing a competitive product and the nature of the market, may allow Allied to continue to have commercial advantages after the expiration of the patent.\nThe company owns and maintains U.S. trademarks for Allied Healthcare Products Inc., Chemetron\u00ae, Gomco\u00ae, Oxequip\u00ae, Lif-O-Gen\u00ae, Life Support Products\u00ae, Timeter\u00ae, Vacutron\u00ae and Schuco\u00ae, its principle trademarks. Registrations for these trademarks are also owned and maintained in countries where such products are sold and such registrations are considered necessary to preserve the Companys proprietary rights therein.\nEnvironmental and Safety Regulation\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes. The Company is also subject to the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and similar state statutes. From time to time, the Company has been involved in environmental proceedings involving cleanup of hazardous waste. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of the Companys remediation obligations at its Stuyvesant Falls facility.\nCompetition\nThe Company has different competitors within each of its product lines. Many of the Companys principal competitors are larger than the Company and have greater financial and other resources. The Company competes primarily on the basis of price, quality and service. The Company believes that it is well positioned with respect to product cost, brand recognition, product reliability, and customer service to compete effectively in each of its markets.\nEmployees\nAt June 30, 2022, the Company had approximately 146 full-time employees. Approximately 82 employees in the Companys principal manufacturing facility located in St. Louis, Missouri, are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire on July 31, 2024.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nThis section provides information regarding the executive officers of the Company who are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors:\nName\nAge\nPosition\nJoseph F. Ondrus\nDirector, President and Chief Executive Officer (1)\nDaniel C. Dunn\nVice President of Finance, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & Treasurer (2)\nKevin D.

Risk Factors\nThe Companys business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K and in the Companys other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before making any investment decision with respect to the Companys securities. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known by the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial may also affect the Companys business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop, the Companys business, financial condition, and results of operations could change.\nCOVID-19 RISKS\nThe global COVID-19 outbreak or other similar outbreaks of infections or diseases could substantially harm our business\nThe global COVID-19 outbreak and other possible pandemics, epidemics or other outbreaks of diseases or infections could have significant negative impacts on our business, expenses, revenues and profitability. These events can result in, and in the case of the COVID-19 outbreak, have resulted in disruptions to our business, including without limitation those arising from the following factors:\n- Employee matters: The Companys ability to operate is contingent on maintaining healthy and safe work conditions. Incidents of COVID-19 in the Companys workforce could lead to delays in production. While the Company is taking steps to protect its employees and maintain safe work conditions, such efforts cannot guarantee that its employees will not be impacted, directly or indirectly, by COVID-19. In addition, partially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and general tightening of the labor market, the Company has had difficulty in obtaining the workers necessary to produce its products. Since the pandemic began, and continuing currently, the Company has experienced greater difficulty in hiring production employees. This has contributed to delays in the production and shipping of some products. Some orders have been cancelled as a result of the delays and this situation may negatively impact our ability to make future sales.\n- Supply chain issues and inflation: Partially as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and inflationary pressures following the reopening of global economies, there have been disruptions to the supply chain that may lead to delays in obtaining necessary raw materials and component inventory. The Company is working with existing and alternative suppliers to obtain the necessary components for its products, however, to date, the Company has not been able to sufficiently alleviate this situation to avoid delays in production.\nLEGAL REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nWe are subject to substantial domestic and international government regulation, including regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes. Failure by us to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe FDA regulates the approval, manufacturing, and sales and marketing of many of our products in the U.S. Significant government regulation also exists in Canada, Japan, and other countries in which we conduct business. As a device manufacturer, we are required to register with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDAs Quality System Regulation (QSR) requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. In addition, the federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns, product recalls or related field actions, product shortages or delays in product manufacturing. Efficacy or safety concerns, an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace, and/or manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls or related field actions, withdrawals, and/or declining sales.\nOur products may be subject to product recalls even after receiving FDA clearance or approval, which would harm our reputation and our business.\nThe FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries in which our products are sold, have the authority to request and, in some cases, require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design defects. Any recall of product would divert managerial and financial resources, may harm our reputation with our customers and could damage our business.\nBUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\nOur success depends upon the development of new products and product enhancements, which entails considerable time and expense.\nTo effectively compete, we must be able to invest in the development of new products to add to our product portfolio and on the development of enhancements to our existing products. Product development involves substantial expense and we cannot be certain that a completed product will generate sufficient revenue for our business to justify the resources that we devote to research and development related to such product. The time and expense required to develop new products and product enhancements is difficult to predict and we cannot assure you that we will succeed in developing, introducing and marketing new products and product enhancements. Our operating losses and negative cash flow impede our ability to invest in the development of new products and enhancements to existing products. Our inability to successfully develop and introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis or at all, or to achieve market acceptance of such products, could materially impair our business.\nWe are dependent on adequate protection of our patent and proprietary rights.\nWe rely on patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. However, these legal means afford us only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or remedies to gain or keep any advantages we may have over our competitors. We cannot assure you that others may not independently develop the same or similar technologies or otherwise obtain access to our technology and trade secrets. Our competitors, many of which have substantial resources and may make substantial investments in competing technologies, may apply for and obtain patents that will prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to manufacture or market our products. Further, while we do not believe that any of our products or processes interfere with the rights of others, third parties may nonetheless assert patent infringement claims against us in the future.\nCostly litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or know-how we own, to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the ownership, scope, or validity of our proprietary rights and the rights of others. Any claims of infringement against us may involve significant liabilities to third parties, could require us to seek licenses from third parties, and could prevent or delay us from manufacturing, selling, or using our products. The occurrence of such litigation or the effect of an adverse determination in any of this type of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDecreased availability or increased costs of raw materials could increase our costs of producing our products.\nWe purchase raw materials, fabricated components and services from a variety of suppliers. Raw materials such as brass, plastics, and calcium hydroxide are considered key raw materials. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers are satisfactory and that alternative sources of supply are readily available. From time to time, however, the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate due to global market demands, which could impair the companys ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost of such materials. Inflationary and other increases in costs of these raw materials have occurred in the past and may recur from time to time. In addition, freight costs associated with shipping and receiving product and sales are impacted by fluctuations in the cost of oil and gas. Specifically, we are currently in a period of high inflation. While the Federal Reserve has commented that the rise in the cost of products is transitory, the Company cannot predict the path of future inflation. In fiscal year 2022, the Company believes that inflation raised the cost of its purchases by approximately $1.3 million. The Company anticipate that these cost increases will continue in fiscal year 2023, although it cannot predict the extent of such increases.\nWe are exposed to certain credit risks, resulting primarily from customer sales.\nSubstantially all of our receivables are due from homecare providers, distributors, hospitals, and contractors. Our customers are located throughout the U.S. and around the world. We record an estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts based primarily on our evaluation of the payment pattern, financial condition, cash flows, and credit history of our customers, as well as current industry and economic conditions. Our inability to collect on our trade accounts receivable could substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur common stock is thinly traded and its market price may fluctuate widely.\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market but is thinly traded. As a result, stockholders may not be able to sell shares of common stock on short notice. Additionally, the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variation in our operating results, announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors, and other events or factors. For example, a shortfall in net sales or net income, or an increase in losses could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many micro and small capitalization companies and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Additionally, management believes that since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic there has increased speculation in the Companys shares which has resulted in significant fluctuations in price. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price for our common stock.\nIf a natural or man-made disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities, we may be unable to manufacture certain products for a substantial amount of time and our revenue could decline.\nWe have two manufacturing operations. In the event that one of these facilities were severely damaged or destroyed as a result of a natural or man-made disaster we would be forced to relocate production to other facilities and/or rely on third-party manufacturers. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we have insurance for damage to our property and the interruption of our business, this insurance may not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIf we are unable to hire or retain key employees, it could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur failure to attract and retain skilled personnel could hinder the management of our business, our research and development, our sales and marketing efforts, and our manufacturing capabilities. However, there is no assurance that we will continue to be able to hire or retain key employees. We compete to hire new employees from larger, better capitalized companies, and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. Our operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. Any unplanned turnover could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage. The Company has not provided salary increases to its employees outside of the collective bargaining unit in several years. While the Company does not believe that this has had a material impact on its operations, the Company may be materially adversely impacted if it fails to compete with the compensation offerings of other employers.\nWe have a history of net losses in fiscal 2019, 2020 and 2022 and we may not be able to return to profitability in the future and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have a history of net losses. We reported a net loss of $2.1 million in fiscal 2019, a net loss of $3.1 million in fiscal 2020 and a net loss of $5.4 million in the most recent fiscal year. In fiscal 2021 we had net income of $1.7 million including the benefit of the forgiveness of a $2.4 million PPP loan. We will need to generate and sustain increased sales levels in the future to become consistently profitable, and, even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase our level of profitability. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts to achieve consistent profitability. We may also incur losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this Form 10-K, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown events. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market price of our common stock may significantly decrease. If we continue to experience operating losses and we are not able to generate additional liquidity through other means, then our liquidity needs may exceed availability under our credit facility, and we might need to secure additional sources of funds, which may or may not be available to us. Additionally, a failure to generate additional liquidity could negatively impact our access to raw materials or services that are important to the operation of our business. Most recently, the Company has experienced significant challenges sourcing necessary parts and components both from vendors and the Companys internal production. As a result, the Companys backlog of orders has grown. To the extent that the Company cannot timely meet shipping deadlines for existing orders, this may impair the Companys ability to make future sales to impacted customers.\nWhile the Company received $6.8 million, net of the escrowed amounts for repairs to the building, as a result of the sale-leaseback of its St. Louis Property, as described in Part I, Item 2 below, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from its operations.\nThe Companys financial statements have been presented assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Companys rate of cash used in operating activities has accelerated and there is doubt as to whether the Companys liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to allow the Company to meet its needs for the next twelve months. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in operation.\nINDUSTRY & ECONOMIC RISKS\nWe participate in a highly competitive environment.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by rapid technological change, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions. Our products may be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations. We face intense competition from other manufacturers. Some of our competitors may be larger than we are and may have greater financial, technical, research, marketing, sales, distribution and other resources than we do. We believe that price competition will continue among products developed in our markets. Our competitors may develop or market technologies and products that are more effective or commercially attractive than any we are developing or marketing. Our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval and introducing or commercializing products before we do. Such developments could have a significant negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we are able to compete successfully, we may not be able to do so in a profitable manner.\nOur business of manufacturing, marketing, and selling of medical devices involves the risk of liability claims and such claims could seriously harm our business, particularly if our insurance coverage is inadequate.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, production, marketing and sale of medical devices. Like other participants in the medical device market, we are from time to time involved in lawsuits, claims and proceedings alleging product liability and related claims such as negligence. If any current or future product liability claims become substantial, our reputation could be damaged significantly, thereby harming our business. We may be required to pay substantial damage awards as a result of any successful product liability claims. Any product liability claim against us, whether with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, and divert the time, attention, and resources of our management.\nAs a result of our exposure to product liability claims, we currently carry product liability insurance covering our products with policy limits per occurrence and in the aggregate that we have deemed to be sufficient. Our insurance may not cover certain product liability claims or our liability for any claims may exceed our coverage limits. Therefore, we cannot predict whether this insurance is sufficient, or if not, whether we will be able to obtain sufficient insurance to cover the risks associated with our business or whether such insurance will be available at premiums that are commercially reasonable. In addition, these insurance policies must be renewed annually. Although we have been able to obtain liability insurance, such insurance may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, if at all. A successful claim against us or settlement by us with respect to uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage, or our inability to maintain insurance in the future, or any claim that results in significant costs to or adverse publicity against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to the U.S. healthcare industry and third party payment structures may not be favorable to us.\nOver a number of years, the U.S. healthcare industry has undergone significant changes designed to increase access to and affordability of medical care, improve safety and patient outcomes, contain costs and increase efficiencies. These changes have included general declines in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels, efforts by healthcare insurance companies to limit or reduce payments to pharmacies and providers, the basis for payments beginning to transition from a fee-for-service model to value-based payments and risk-sharing models, and the industry shifting away from traditional healthcare venues like hospitals and into clinics, physician offices and patients homes. Any or all of the measures could impact demand for our products.\nThe cost of a majority of medical care in the United States is funded by the U.S. Government through the Medicare and Medicaid programs and by private insurance programs, such as corporate health insurance plans. Although we do not receive payments for our products directly from these programs, home respiratory care providers and durable medical equipment suppliers, who are the primary customers for several of our products, depend heavily on payments from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers as a major source of revenues. In addition, sales of certain of our products are affected by the extent of hospital and health care facility construction and renovation at any given time. The federal government indirectly funds a significant percentage of such construction and renovation costs through Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. In recent years, governmentally imposed limits on reimbursement to hospitals and other health care providers have impacted spending for services, consumables and capital goods. A material decrease from current reimbursement levels or a material change in the method or basis of reimbursing health care providers is likely to adversely affect future sales of our products.\nWe expect the U.S. healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Possible changes include further reduction or limitations on governmental funding at the state or federal level, efforts by healthcare insurance companies to further limit payments for products and services or changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription pharmaceutical pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits. These possible changes, and the uncertainty surrounding these possible changes, may adversely affect us. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable. Item 2. Properties\nThe Companys headquarters are located in St. Louis, Missouri and the Company maintains manufacturing facilities in Missouri and New York. Set forth below is certain information with respect to the Companys manufacturing facilities at June 30, 2022.\nSquare Footage\nOwned/\nLocation\n(Approximate)\nLeased\nActivities/Products\nSt. Louis, Missouri\n242,000\nLeased\nHeadquarters; medical gas equipment; respiratory care products; emergency medical products\nStuyvesant Falls, New York\n30,000\nOwned\nCarbon dioxide absorbent\nIn addition, the Company owns a 16.8-acre parcel of undeveloped land in Stuyvesant Falls, New York.\nThe Company owned its St. Louis, Missouri facility outright until June 2022. On June 16, 2022 the Company consummated a sale-leaseback transaction of its St. Louis real estate, consisting of its headquarters and plant. As part of this transaction, the Company sold the St. Louis real estate, including both the land and building, to a third party landlord for $8.3 million, of which $1.5 million was placed into escrow to provide security for repairs to the facilitys roof, HVAC and other issues. The Company simultaneously entered into a fifteen year lease with the purchaser pursuant to which the Company pays annual rent of $688,800, subject to annual increases. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nProduct liability lawsuits are filed against the Company from time to time for various injuries alleged to have resulted from defects in the manufacture and/or design of the Companys products. Any such proceedings that are currently pending are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company maintains comprehensive general liability insurance coverage which it believes to be adequate for the continued operation of its business, including coverage of product liability claims.\nIn addition, from time to time the Companys products may be subject to product recalls in order to correct design or manufacturing flaws in such products. The Company intends to continue to conduct business in such a manner as to avert any FDA action seeking to interrupt or suspend manufacturing or require any recall or modification of products.\nHowever, for these matters, management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcomes of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition as a whole, though the outcomes could be material to the Companys operating results for a particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.\nStuyvesant Falls Cleanup\nOn January 30, 2020, the Company filed a Citizen Participation Plan with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation under its Brownfield Cleanup Program. The plan was filed with respect to the Companys property in Stuyvesant Falls, New York. The plan recognizes that the soil and groundwater at the Stuyvesant Falls facility is impacted by chemical compounds exceeding regulatory standards. On October 13, 2020, the Company executed a Brownfield Cleanup Program Agreement with the Department of Environmental Conservation with respect to the property. Under the agreement, the Company has voluntarily agreed to conduct, at its expense, certain remedial investigations and remedial actions with respect to suspected soil and groundwater contamination at the site with oversight by the department.\nThe Companys best estimate of the expected cost to remediate the site is $1.3 million. The Company recorded $1.1 million as an expense in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 and is reflected in other accrued liabilities and selling, general and administrative expenses in the Companys financial statements. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company recorded an additional $171,000. As of June 30, 2022, the Company has paid approximately $634,000 in remediation expenses which have been charged to the initial reserve.\nVendor Demand Letter\nOn June 22, 2022, the Company received a demand letter from one of its vendors, International Control Services, Inc. (ICS) for $586,000 as payment on outstanding ICS invoices. The invoices in question cover components which the Company rejected as defective, certain charges for prior years and purchases the Company cancelled which ICS claims were non-cancellable. The Companys standard purchase orders provide that the Company may reject defective parts and that all purchases are cancellable by the Company for its convenience. The Company disputes all of ICSs claims, including that any portion of the subject purchases were non-cancellable. No litigation has been commenced as of this filing, but the Company will defend any such lawsuit. The Company estimates that the range of loss is between $0 and $586,000. The Company has not recorded a provision for this matter because, at this early stage, there is insufficient information to determine the likelihood of loss or to estimate any possible loss. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNone\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nAllied Healthcare Products, Inc. trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol AHPI. As of September 14, 2022, there were 34 record owners of the Companys common stock. The number of holders of record does not represent the actual number of beneficial owners of our common stock because securities dealers and others frequently hold shares in street name for the benefit of individual owners who have the right to vote shares.\nThe following table summarizes information with respect to the high and low prices for the Companys common stock as listed on the NASDAQ Global or Capital Market for each quarter of fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company currently does not pay, and historically has not paid, any dividend on its common stock.\nCommon Stock Information\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nLow\nSeptember quarter\n$\n16.41\n$\n3.62\nSeptember quarter\n$\n13.27\n$\n4.66\nDecember quarter\n$\n9.82\n$\n4.55\nDecember quarter\n$\n8.13\n$\n4.20\nMarch quarter\n$\n6.04\n$\n2.41\nMarch quarter\n$\n9.00\n$\n4.07\nJune quarter\n$\n3.32\n$\n1.55\nJune quarter\n$\n5.30\n$\n3.45\nInformation concerning securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is incorporated by reference to the Companys proxy statement for the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, which will be filed within 120 days after June 30, 2022.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCOVID-19 Outbreak and Aftermath of Pandemic\nThe Company believes that the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in increased sales in of ventilator products in fiscal 2021, however, this peak in demand ended in fiscal 2021 and the impacts of the COVID-19 continue to develop. In fiscal 2022 demand dropped from the peak, and the Company believes that COVID-19 is no longer contributing positively to product demand.\nThe pandemic is partially responsible for broad economic changes which have impacted the Company in fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2022 and continue to impact the Company as the Company begins fiscal 2023. Inflation has raised the cost of products and services the Company uses to provide its products. In fiscal year 2021, the Company estimates that inflationary price increases raised product cost by approximately $500,000. In fiscal year 2022, the Company estimates that inflationary price increases raised product cost by an additional $1.3 million dollars. While the Federal Reserve initially believed some of the inflation in the economy was transitory in nature, the Company believes inflation will continue to increase cost in fiscal 2023.\nSince the onset of the pandemic the Company has found it harder to hire and retain hourly workers. This has led to the requirement for additional overtime for existing employees, inefficiency, and contributed to delays in shipments.\nIn fiscal year 2022, the Company faced production difficulties, including supply chain issues. A portion of these challenges were the result of general pressures on supply chains as the global economy emerged from lockdowns. For the Company, this has resulted in longer lead times and shortages of components. It has been difficult to replace those vendors not delivering components in a timely manner. In addition, our purchasing department effectiveness has suffered due to the amount of time required to expedite parts. At times, purchase orders have not been placed in a timely manner, lengthening the lead time and causing part shortages. Internally, we have had difficulty producing machined parts on a timely basis due to a shortage of skilled labor and a vacancy in a key machine shop management position. These problems have led to product shortages and a large increase in customer orders not shipped and past due. This results in a lower level of sales and liquidity. The Company believes these impacts will continue in fiscal year 2023 and the Companys shipments and sales will remain under pressure as a result.\nResults of Operations\nThe Company manufactures and markets respiratory products, including respiratory care products, medical gas equipment and emergency medical products. Set forth below is certain information with respect to amounts and percentages of net sales attributable to respiratory care products, medical gas equipment and emergency medical products for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nDollars in thousands\nYear ended June 30,\nNet\n% of Total\nSales\nNet Sales\nRespiratory care products\n$\n8,178\n30.3\n%\nMedical gas equipment\n13,449\n49.7\n%\nEmergency medical products\n5,420\n20.0\n%\nTotal\n$\n27,047\n100.0\n%\nDollars in thousands\nYear ended June 30,\nNet\n% of Total\nSales\nNet Sales\nRespiratory care products\n$\n8,083\n22.3\n%\nMedical gas equipment\n15,943\n43.9\n%\nEmergency medical products\n12,253\n33.8\n%\nTotal\n$\n36,279\n100.0\n%\nDollars in thousands\nYear ended June 30,\nNet\n% of Total\nSales\nNet Sales\nRespiratory care products\n$\n8,556\n26.8\n%\nMedical gas equipment\n15,283\n47.9\n%\nEmergency medical products\n8,055\n25.3\n%\nTotal\n$\n31,894\n100.0\n%\nThe following table sets forth, for the fiscal periods indicated, the percentage of net sales represented by the various income and expense categories reflected in the Companys Statement of Operations.\nYear ended June 30,\nNet sales\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\nCost of sales\n90.7\n80.4\n82.5\nGross profit\n9.3\n19.6\n17.5\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n26.2\n21.1\n27.1\nLoss from operations\n(16.9)\n(1.5)\n(9.6)\nInterest expense\n0.7\n0.3\n0.2\nPPP loan forgiveness\n0.0\n(6.6)\n0.0\nOther, net\n0.0\n0.0\n0.1\nIncome (loss) before provision for income taxes\n(17.6)\n4.8\n(9.9)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n2.2\n0.2\n(0.4)\nNet income (loss)\n(19.8)\n%\n4.6\n%\n(9.5)\n%\nCritical Accounting Policies\nRevenue recognition:\nThe Companys revenues are derived primarily from the sales of respiratory products, medical gas equipment and emergency medical products. The products are generally sold directly to distributors, customers affiliated with buying groups, individual customers and construction contractors, throughout the world.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales upon satisfaction of its performance obligation which occurs on the transfer of control of the product, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. Payment terms between Allied and its customers vary by the type of customer, country of sale, and the products offered. The term between invoicing and the payment due date is not significant.\nManagement exercises judgment in estimating variable consideration. Provisions for early payment discounts, rebates and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales.\nThe Company provides rebates to wholesalers. Rebate amounts are based upon purchases using contractual amount for each product sold. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate and the customer or price terms that apply. Using known contractual allowances, the Company estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when it records the sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs in the month following the sale.\nThe Company regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and adjusts reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Historically, adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income.\nOther allowances charged against gross sales include cash discounts and returns, which are not significant. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because the Companys historical returns are low, and because sales return terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Product warranties are also not significant.\nThe Company does not allocate transaction price as the Company has only one performance obligation and its contracts do not span multiple periods. All taxes imposed on and concurrent with revenue producing transactions and collected by the Company are excluded from the measurement of transaction price.\nInventory reserve for obsolete and excess inventory:\nInventory is recorded net of a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory which is determined primarily based on an analysis of inventory items with no usage in the preceding year and for inventory items for which there is greater than two years usage on hand. This analysis considers those identified inventory items to determine, in managements best estimate, if parts can be used beyond one year, if there are alternate uses or at what values such parts may be disposed for. At June 30, 2022 and 2021, inventory is recorded net of a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory of $2.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively.\nIncome taxes:\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740: Income Taxes. Under ASC 740, the deferred tax provision is determined using the liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income when such assets and liabilities are anticipated to be settled or realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as tax expense or benefit in the period that includes the enactment date of the change.\nValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Management uses a more likely than not criterion in its assessment and considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, in determining whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company first considers the reversals of existing temporary deferred tax liabilities and available tax planning strategies. To the extent these items are not sufficient to cause the realization of deferred tax assets, the Company would then consider the availability of future taxable income only to the extent such income is considered likely to occur based on the Companys earnings history, current income trends and projections.\nConsidering its history of operating losses, the Company does not rely on the existence of future taxable income as it currently cannot conclude future taxable income is likely to occur. The Company does rely on reversals of existing temporary deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies to the extent available to support the value of its existing deferred tax assets. Prior to 2022, the Company relied on tax planning strategies which consisted of revocation of the LIFO inventory method and the recognition of a gain in the sale of excess land to support the value of a portion of the Companys deferred tax assets. In light of continued losses and its assessment of the Companys ability to continue as a going concern, management concluded that the previously relied upon tax planning strategies were no longer available to support any amount of deferred tax assets. Accordingly, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance for the excess of deferred tax assets over deferred tax liabilities as of June 30, 2022.\nAccounts receivable net of allowances:\nAccounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is determined based on an analysis of past due accounts including accounts placed with collection agencies, and an allowance for returns and credits, which is based on historical analysis of credit memo data and returns. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the collectability of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts. Accounts receivable are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when the Company determines that the receivable will not be collected and/or when the account has been referred to a third party collection agency. At June 30, 2022 and 2021, accounts receivable is recorded net of allowances of $170,000.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets:\nThe impairment of long-lived assets is assessed when changes in circumstances (such as, but not limited to, a decrease in market value of an asset, current and historical operating losses or a change in business strategy) indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. This assessment is based on managements expectations and judgments regarding future business and economic conditions, future market values and disposal costs. Actual results and events could differ significantly from managements estimates. Based upon our most recent analysis, we believe that no impairment exists at June 30, 2022. There can be no assurance that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to net earnings (loss).\nSelf-insurance:\nThe Company maintains a self-insurance program for a portion of its health care costs. Self-insurance costs are accrued based upon the aggregate of the liability for reported claims and the estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had approximately $125,000 and $120,000, respectively, of accrued liabilities related to health care claims. In order to establish the self-insurance reserves, the Company utilized actuarial estimates of expected claims based on analyses of historical data.\nShare Based Compensation:\nThe Company calculates share based compensation using the Black-Sholes-Merton (Black-Scholes) option-pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. For the twelve-month periods ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, Allied recorded approximately $16,000, $14,000 and $2,000, respectively, in share-based employee compensation. This compensation cost is included in the general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Statements of Operations.\nFiscal 2022 Compared to Fiscal 2021\nThe Company had a loss of $4.8 million before taxes for fiscal 2022, compared to income of $1.8 million before taxes for fiscal 2021. It recorded an income tax provision of $599,672 in fiscal 2022, compared to an income tax provision of $72,484 in fiscal 2021.\nNet sales for fiscal 2022 of $27.0 million were $9.3 million or 25.6% lower than net sales of $36.3 million in fiscal 2021. Domestically, sales decreased by $3.5 million dollars while international sales, which represented 23.6% of fiscal 2022 sales, were $5.7 million lower. The $9.3 million decrease in sales includes a $2.5 million decrease in medical gas equipment and a $6.8 million decrease in emergency medical products consisting of a $4.9 million decrease in AHP300 ventilator sales. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 the Company fulfilled orders that were taken at the start of the pandemic in fiscal 2020. Sales in fiscal 2022 were also negatively impacted by supply chain delays, production delays, and a staffing shortage in our manufacturing operation. The Company expects these trends to continue in fiscal 2023. International business is dependent upon hospital construction projects, and the development of medical facilities and emergency services in those regions in which the Company operates, as well as the economic and political climates in those international markets.\nOrders for the Companys products for the year ended June 30, 2022 of $28.5 million were $1.1 million or 3.7% lower than orders for the year ended June 30, 2021 of $29.6 million. Domestic orders are down 2.1% from the prior fiscal year while international orders, which represented 25.0% of orders for fiscal 2022, were 7.8% lower than orders for the prior year same period. The decrease in orders was primarily due to a $1.7 million decrease in orders for AHP300 ventilators. This decrease was partially offset by a $0.3 million increase in medical gas equipment and $0.6 million increase in respiratory care products.\nRespiratory care product sales, which include homecare products, were $8.2 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $8.1 million in 2021. Respiratory care products include carbon dioxide absorbents. For the year ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 the Company had carbon dioxide absorbent sales of Carbolime\u00ae and Litholyme\u00ae of $3.7 million.\nMedical gas equipment sales, which include construction products, of $13.4 million in fiscal 2022 were approximately $2.5 million, or 15.7% lower than prior year levels of $15.9 million, while orders for these products increased by 2.0%. The decrease in sales was attributable to production and shipping problems and the timing of customer releases.\nEmergency medical product sales in fiscal 2022 of $5.4 million were $6.9 million or 56.1% lower than fiscal 2021 sales of $12.3 million. International sales of emergency medical products decreased by $4.9 million from the prior year while domestic sales decreased by $1.9 million.\nInternational sales, which are included in the product lines discussed above, decreased $5.7 million, or 47.1%, to $6.4 million in fiscal 2022 compared to sales of $12.1 million in fiscal 2021. The decrease was primarily for AHP300 ventilators.\nGross profit in fiscal 2022 was $2.5 million, or 9.3% of sales, compared to a gross profit of $7.1 million, or 19.6% of sales in fiscal 2021. The $4.6 million decrease in gross profit is mainly attributable to a $9.3 million decrease in sales. The decrease in gross profit was also attributable to increase of cost due to inflation for our purchased raw materials and components.\nSelling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) expenses for fiscal 2022 were $7.1 million compared to SG&A expenses of $7.6 million in fiscal 2021. The decrease is primarily due to a $0.5 million decrease in personnel costs consisting of salaries and benefits and a $0.3 million decrease in legal fees in fiscal 2022. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.2 million increase for environmental remediation expenses in fiscal 2022.\nInterest income in fiscal 2022 was $176 compared to interest income of $233 in fiscal 2021. Interest expense in fiscal 2022 was $191,450 compared to interest expense of $115,975 in fiscal 2021.\nOther income and expenses in fiscal 2021 include $2.4 million of income realized by the Company as a result of forgiveness of the PPP Loan.\nThe Companys effective tax rate in 2022 was a provision of 12.5% compared to a provision of 4.1% in 2021. The change in the effective tax rate in 2022 was attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance in 2022 and non-deductible expenses attributable to the Companys PPP Loan forgiveness in 2021.\nThe realization of the Companys deferred tax assets has been based on the reversal of existing temporary deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies and to the extent those items are not sufficient to support the value of recorded deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is recorded. For the year ended 2020 the Company recorded an additional allowance of $178,111 offset by an increase in the value of tax planning strategies of $138,873 resulting in a net increase in the allowance of $39,238. For the year ended 2021, the company recorded an additional allowance of $723,248. The allowance was further increased by a reduction in the value of the tax planning strategy of $63,676 resulting in a total increase to the allowance of $786,921. For the year ended June 30, 2022, management concluded previously relied upon tax planning strategies were no longer available and the Company recorded an additional allowance of $1,735,227 fully reserving the value of its net deferred tax assets.\nNet loss in fiscal 2022 was $5.4 million or $1.34 per basic and diluted earnings per share compared to a net income of $1.7 million, or $0.42 per basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2021. In 2022 and 2021 the weighted number of shares used in the calculation of basic earnings per share was 4,013,537. In 2022 and 2021 the weighted number of shares used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share was 4,013,537 and 4,026,446, respectively.\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nThe Company had income of $1.8 million before taxes for fiscal 2021, compared to a loss of $3.1 million before taxes for fiscal 2020. It recorded an income tax provision of $72,484 in fiscal 2021, compared to an income tax benefit of $130,359 in fiscal 2020.\nNet sales for fiscal 2021 of $36.3 million were $4.4 million or 13.8% higher than net sales of $31.9 million in fiscal 2020. Domestically, sales increased by $1.0 million dollars while international sales, which represented 33.4% of fiscal 2021 sales, were $3.4 million higher. The increase in domestic sales was largely attributable to increases in sales of construction products and emergency medical products. International business is dependent upon hospital construction projects, and the development of medical facilities and emergency services in those regions in which the Company operates, as well as the economic and political climates in those international markets.\nOrders for the Companys products for the year ended June 30, 2021 of $29.6 million were $11.2 million or 27.5% lower than orders for the year ended June 30, 2020 of $40.8 million. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in fiscal year 2020, the Company experienced significantly increased orders for the emergency medical products sold by the Company, including the Companys AHP300 ventilator and the EPV200 ventilator. In fiscal year 2021 the pace of orders materially decreased.\nRespiratory care product sales, which include homecare products, were $8.1 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $8.6 million in 2020. Respiratory care products include carbon dioxide absorbents. For the year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 the Company had carbon dioxide absorbent sales of Carbolime\u00ae and Litholyme\u00ae of $3.7 million.\nMedical gas equipment sales, which include construction products, of $15.9 million in fiscal 2021 were approximately $0.6 million, or 3.9% higher than prior year levels of $15.3 million. The increase in sales was largely attributable to an increase sales of non-construction products of $1.5 million. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in international construction sales of $0.7 million.\nEmergency medical product sales in fiscal 2021 of $12.3 million were $4.2 million or 51.9% higher than fiscal 2020 sales of $8.1 million. International sales of emergency medical products increased by $3.3 million from the prior year while domestic sales increased by $0.9 million. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic increased demand for the Companys emergency products including the AHP300 ventilator.\nInternational sales, which are included in the product lines discussed above, increased $3.4 million, or 39.1%, to $12.1 million in fiscal 2021 compared to sales of $8.7 million in fiscal 2020.\nGross profit in fiscal 2021 was $7.1 million, or 19.6% of sales, compared to a gross profit of $5.6 million, or 17.6% of sales in fiscal 2020. The $1.5 million increase in gross profit is mainly attributable to a $4.4 million increase in sales.\nThe Company invested approximately $0.2 million in fiscal 2021 and $0.8 million in fiscal 2020 for capital expenditures primarily for the expansion of the production line of our AHP300 ventilator.\nSelling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) expenses for fiscal 2021 were $7.6 million compared to SG&A expenses of $8.6 million in fiscal 2020. The decrease is primarily due to the $1.1 million provision in fiscal 2020 for environmental cleanup costs at the Companys facility in Stuyvesant Falls, New York and a decrease of $0.2 million for business travel expenses in fiscal 2021. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.2 million increase for legal and insurance expenses in fiscal 2021.\nInterest income in fiscal 2021 was $233 compared to interest income of $654 in fiscal 2020. Interest expense in fiscal 2021 was $115,975 compared to interest expense of $64,682 in fiscal 2020.\nOther income and expenses in fiscal 2021 include $2.4 million of income realized by the Company as a result of forgiveness of the PPP Loan.\nThe Companys effective tax rate in 2021 was a provision of 4.1% compared to a benefit of 4.1% in 2020. The change in the effective tax rate in 2021 was attributable to non-deductible expenses attributable to the Companys expected PPP Loan forgiveness and a decrease in the value of tax planning strategies.\nThe realization of the Companys deferred tax assets has been based on the reversal of existing temporary deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies and to the extent those items are not sufficient to support the value of recorded deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is recorded. For the year ended June 30, 2019 the Company recorded an additional allowance of $536,240. For the year ended 2020 the Company recorded an additional allowance of $178,111 offset by an increase in the value of tax planning strategies of $138,873 resulting in a net increase in the allowance of $39,238. For the year ended 2021, the company recorded an additional allowance of $723,248. The allowance was further increased by a reduction in the value of the tax planning strategy of $63,676 resulting in a total increase to the allowance of $786,921. To the extent that the Companys losses continue, the tax benefit of those losses would be fully offset by a valuation allowance.\nNet income in fiscal 2021 was $1.7 million or $0.42 per basic and diluted earnings per share compared to a net loss of $3.0 million, or $0.75 per basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020. In 2021 and 2020 the weighted number of shares used in the calculation of basic earnings per share was 4,013,537. In 2021 and 2020 the weighted number of shares used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share was 4,026,446 and 4,013,537, respectively.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table sets forth selected information concerning Allieds financial condition at June 30:\nDollars in thousands\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n5,047\n$\n$\n2,600\nWorking Capital\n$\n10,099\n$\n6,271\n$\n5,949\nTotal Debt\n$\n10,578\n$\n2,091\n$\n2,392\nCurrent Ratio\n2.69:1\n1.88:1\n1.67:1\nThe Companys working capital was $10.1 million at June 30, 2022 compared to $6.3 million at June 30, 2021. The $3.8 million increase in working capital is attributed to a cash and restricted cash increase of $4.1 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $0.7 million and decrease in other accrued liabilities of $1.3 million. During fiscal 2022, these increases were partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $1.0 million decrease in inventory, a debt increase of $0.5 million and a $0.3 million in customer deposits. Accounts payable and other accrued liabilities are subject to normal fluctuations in purchasing levels and the timing of payments within the quarter. Accounts receivable as measured in days sales outstanding (DSO) is 38 DSO at June 30, 2022, down from 40 DSO at June 30, 2021. The Company does adjust product forecast, order quantities, and safety stock based on changes in demand patterns in order to manage inventory levels.\nThe net increase in cash and restricted cash for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 was $4.3 million. The net decrease in cash for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 was $1.9 million. Cash flows used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 consisted of net loss of $5.4 million, a $0.7 million decrease in accounts payable and $0.8 million decrease in other accrued liabilities. These cash out flows were offset by a decrease of Accounts receivable of $0.6 million, a decrease in inventory of $1.0 million and a $0.3 million increase in customer deposits, supplemented by $0.5 million in non-cash charges for amortization and depreciation.\nCash flows used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 consisted of a decrease in Customer deposits of $2.2 million, a decrease of Accounts payable of $1.1 million and increase of Inventory of $0.5 million. These cash out flows were offset by a decrease of Accounts receivable of $0.2 million and net income of $1.7 million, supplemented by $0.6 million in non-cash charges for amortization and depreciation.\nThe Companys financial statements have been presented assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Companys rate of cash used in operating activities has accelerated and there is doubt as to whether the Companys liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to allow the Company to meet its needs for the next twelve months. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The Company is seeking to fill open positions, expedite needed components, improve the performance of management, and find new sources of components where necessary. The Company has engaged a consulting firm to assess and improve its operational capabilities. These actions are intended to mitigate the substantial doubt raised by the Companys historical operating results and current shipping difficulties. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful.\nSale-Leaseback of St. Louis Property\nOn June 16, 2022 the Company entered into a sale agreement for the Companys headquarters and manufacturing facilities located at 1720 Sublette Avenue in St. Louis, Missouri. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale of the property, the Company entered into a lease with the buyer with a fifteen year term. Under the terms of the lease agreement, the Companys initial basic rent is approximately $57,400 per month, with annual increases of approximately 2% each year of the initial term.\nPursuant to the agreement for the sale of the St. Louis headquarters property, $1,500,000 of the sales proceeds is held in escrow to pay for the repair and/or replacement of certain agreed upon items, including the roof, HVAC system and certain lighting in the offices. Any funds remaining in the Improvement Escrow will be paid to the Company when the improvements are substantially completed.\nOf the Companys $4.3 million increase in cash during fiscal year 2022, $8.1 million was due to the closing of the sale leaseback. The sale leaseback has also resulted in an increase in the Companys operating cash needs by the amount of the rent under the new lease, which is $57,400 per month.\nNorth Mill Loan Agreement\nThe Company is party to a Loan and Security Agreement with North Mill Capital, LLC (North Mill), as successor in interest to Summit Financial Resources, L.P., dated effective February 27, 2017, as amended April 16, 2018, April 24, 2019, December 18, 2020, October 7, 2021 and June 13, 2022 (as amended, the Credit Agreement). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company obtained a secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility). The Companys obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by all of the Companys personal property, both tangible and intangible, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. Availability of funds under the Credit Agreement is based on the Companys accounts receivable and inventory but will not exceed $4,000,000. At June 30, 2022 borrowing under the agreement was $2,466,360, maximum available borrowing based on eligible collateral was $3,345,123, resulting in availability of $878,763.\nAvailability of funds under the Credit Agreement is based on the Companys eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory but will not exceed $4,000,000. In determining eligible Accounts Receivable Advances several classifications are considered ineligible and are subtracted from the Companys total Accounts Receivable before calculating eligible Accounts Receivable. Ineligible receivables include receivables from governmental entities, receivables to be paid by credit card, uninsured international receivables, receivables over 90 days old, and receivables from customers with a significant concentration of receivables over 90 days old. The Company may be advanced up to 85% of eligible Accounts Receivable under the loan agreement.\nAccounts Receivable is dependent on sales revenue. Decreased sales revenue has resulted in decreased Accounts Receivable available for loan collateral. At June 30, 2022 the Company had Accounts Receivable of $1,672,581 included as eligible collateral in determining total available borrowing advances under the loan agreement.\nIn determining eligible inventory several categories of inventory are subtracted from total inventory. Work in Process Inventory, Packaging and Supplies, and Inventory Reserves are subtracted from total inventory to calculate eligible inventory. The Company may be advanced up to 25% of eligible inventory. Advances from inventory are limited by the lesser of the calculated eligible inventory, two million dollars ($2,000,000), or the amount advanced from eligible Accounts Receivable. At June 30, 2022 the Company had $1,672,581 from Inventory included as eligible collateral in determining total available borrowing under the loan agreement. At June 30, 2022 Inventory Advances were limited by the eligible Accounts Receivable Advance of $1,672,581.\nThe Credit Facility will be available, subject to its terms, on a revolving basis until it expires on September 30, 2024, at which time all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility will be due and payable. Advances will bear interest at a rate equal to 2.00% in excess of the prime rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal. Interest is computed based on the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days. In addition to interest, the Credit facility requires that the Company pay the lender a monthly administration fee in an amount equal to forty-seven hundredths percent (0.47%) of the average outstanding daily principal amount of loan advances for each calendar month, or portion thereof.\nRegardless of the amount borrowed under the Credit Facility, the Company will pay a minimum amount of .25% (25 basis points) per month on the maximum availability ($10,000 per month).\nUnder the Credit Agreement, advances are generally subject to customary borrowing conditions and to North Mills sole discretion to fund the advances. The Credit Agreement also contains covenants with which the Company must comply during the term of the Credit Facility. Among other things, such covenants require the Company to maintain insurance on the collateral, operate in the ordinary course and not engage in a change of control, dissolve or wind up the Company.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains certain events of default including, without limitation: the failure to make payments when due; the material breach of representations or warranties contained in the Credit Agreement or other loan documents; cross-default with other indebtedness of the Company; the entry of judgments or fines that may have a material adverse effect on the Company; failure to comply with the observance or performance of covenants contained in the Credit Agreement or other loan documents; insolvency of the Company, appointment of a receiver, commencement of bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings; dissolution of the Company; the attachment of any state or federal tax lien; attachment or levy upon or seizure of the Companys property; or any change in the Companys condition that may have a material adverse effect. After an event of default, and upon the continuation thereof, the principal amount of all loans made under the Credit Facility would bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 20.00% above the otherwise applicable interest rate (provided, that the interest rate may not exceed the highest rate permissible under law) and would have the option to accelerate maturity and payment of the Companys obligations under the Credit Facility. The Company was in compliance with all of the covenants associated with the Credit Facility at June 30, 2022.\nPPP Loan\nOn April 13, 2020, the Company entered into a Payroll Protection Program (PPP) loan agreement (the SBA Loan) with Jefferson Bank and Trust Company under the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the SBA). The Company received total proceeds of $2.375 million from the SBA Loan. In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act, the Company used proceeds from the SBA Loan for payroll costs and other permitted uses.\nThe loan, including all principal and accrued interest, was forgiven on June 11, 2021.\nAt June 30, 2022 the Company had $10.6 million indebtedness, including lease obligations, short-term debt, and long term debt. The prime rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal was 4.75% on June 30, 2022.\nThe following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations at June 30, 2022:\nPayments due by period\nLess than\n1-3\n3-5\nMore than\nContractual Obligations\nTotal\n1 year\nyears\nyears\n5 years\nLong-Term Debt\n$\n10,577,556\n$\n2,603,249\n$\n318,926\n426,243\n7,229,138\nCapital Lease Obligations\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOperating Leases\n$\n6,790\n$\n4,527\n$\n2,263\n$\n-\n-\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOther Long-Term Obligations\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal Contractual Cash Obligations\n$\n10,584,346\n$\n2,607,776\n$\n321,189\n$\n426,243\n$\n7,229,138\nCapital expenditures were approximately $75,000, $167,000, and $758,000 in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The Company believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under its credit facilities will be sufficient to finance fixed payments and planned capital expenditures of $1.6 million in 2023. Pursuant to the agreement for the sale of the St. Louis headquarters property, $1,500,000 of the sales proceeds is held in escrow to pay for the repair and/or replacement of certain agreed upon items, including the roof, HVAC system and certain lighting in the offices. It is anticipated that these capital expenditures will be completed in 2023.\nAt June 30, 2022, the Company had $10.6 million outstanding debt. During fiscal 2022 the Company had $28.5 million in borrowings and $28.1 million in repayments under the Credit Agreement. The Company received cash from a failed sale-leaseback reflected as a financial liability on the Companies balance sheet of $8.1 million net of financing costs of $0.2 million. Cash used in operations was $4.1 million in fiscal 2022. Cash used in operations in fiscal 2021 was $3.8 million and cash from operations in fiscal 2020 was $0.6 million. Our cash flows may be further negatively impacted by decreases in sales, market conditions, and adverse changes in working capital. While we believe that our borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement provides sufficient financial flexibility, continued negative cash flows could negatively affect our ability to access the Credit Agreement or to repay amounts borrowed and we might need to secure additional sources of funds, which may or may not be available to us.\nIn 2022, inflation in the price of raw materials and purchased components negatively impacted earnings by approximately $1.3 million dollars. The Company experienced a material direct impact of $21,000 in 2022, and $35,000 in 2021, from changes in trade policy or tariffs. The Company also believes a portion of its increased raw materials costs were due to tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum import. The Company makes its foreign sales in U.S. dollars and, accordingly, sales proceeds are not affected by exchange rate fluctuations. However, fluctuations in exchange rates can affect the price of our products in local currency, which does impact the pace of incoming orders.\nQuarterly Results\nThe following table sets forth selected operating results for the eight quarters ended June 30, 2022. The information for each of these quarters is unaudited, but includes all normal recurring adjustments which the Company considers necessary for a fair presentation thereof. These operating results, however, are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period. Further, operating results may fluctuate as a result of the timing of orders, the Companys product and customer mix, the introduction of new products by the Company and its competitors, and overall trends in the health care industry and the economy. While these patterns have an impact on the Companys quarterly operations, the Company is unable to predict the extent of this impact in any particular period.\nDollars in thousands, except per share data\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\nDec. 31,\nSept. 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\nDec. 31,\nSept. 30,\nThree months ended,\nNet sales\n$\n6,015\n$\n6,867\n$\n6,807\n$\n7,358\n$\n7,018\n$\n7,967\n$\n11,104\n$\n10,190\nGross profit\n1,188\n1,435\n2,612\n1,874\nIncome (loss) from operations\n(1,266)\n(1,232)\n(1,130)\n(952)\n(745)\n(381)\n(135)\nNet income (loss)\n(1,935)\n(1,280)\n(1,162)\n(984)\n1,553\n(413)\n(153)\nBasic earnings (loss) per share\n(0.48)\n(0.32)\n(0.29)\n(0.25)\n0.39\n(0.10)\n0.17\n(0.04)\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share\n(0.48)\n(0.32)\n(0.29)\n(0.25)\n0.39\n(0.10)\n0.17\n(0.04)\nEarnings per share is computed independently for each of the quarters presented. Therefore, the sum of the quarterly amounts will not necessarily equal the total for the year.\nLitigation and Contingencies\nThe Company becomes, from time to time, a party to personal injury litigation arising out of incidents involving the use of its products. The Company believes that any potential judgments resulting from such claims over its self-insured retention will be covered by the Companys product liability insurance.\nIn addition, the Company has received a demand letter from a vendor for $586,000 and is committed to ongoing expenses related to the remediation of its property in Stuyvesant Falls, New York. See Part I, Item 3 for a discussion of these material legal proceedings.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Part II, Item 8, Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their impact on the Companys financial statements, if any. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nAt June 30, 2022, the Company had $2.5 million debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility bears an interest rate using the prime rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal as the basis, as defined in the loan agreement, and therefore is subject to additional expense should there be an increase in market interest rates.\nThe Company had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at June 30, 2022. Allied has international sales; however these sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, mitigating foreign exchange rate fluctuation risk. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe following described financial statements of Allied Healthcare Products, Inc. are included in response to this item:\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. (PCAOB No. 41)\nStatement of Operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nBalance Sheet for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.\nStatement of Changes in Stockholders Equity for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nStatement of Cash Flows for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nNotes to Financial Statements.\nAll other schedules are omitted because they are not applicable or the required information is shown in the financial statements or notes thereto.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\nAllied Healthcare Products, Inc.\nOpinion On The Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Allied Healthcare Products, Inc. (the Company) as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nAbility to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis For Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nInventory Reserve for Obsolete and Excess Inventory - Refer To Notes 2 And 10 To The Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nInventory is recorded at the lower of cost, determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market. Inventory is recorded net of a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory which is determined primarily based on an analysis of inventory items with no usage in the preceding year and for inventory items for which there is greater than two years usage on hand. When quantities on hand exceed usage benchmarks, a write-down is recorded for such excess inventory. Changes in assumptions of product demand could have a significant impact on the amount of write-down recorded.\nGiven the inherent uncertainty in forecasting future inventory usage, including the impact of forecasting future sales activity, auditing the reasonableness of the reserve for obsolete and excess inventory required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the reserve for obsolete and excess inventory included the following, among others:\n\u25cf We tested the completeness and existence of managements obsolete and excess inventory listing that is utilized in the year-end reserve calculation.\n\u25cf We assessed that managements calculations were consistently applied year over year.\n\u25cf We tested the mathematical accuracy of managements calculations.\n\u25cf We selected a sample of products and verified that the expected future inventory usage was supported by historical sales data and other current information.\n/s/RubinBrown LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2003.\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nOctober 7, 2022\nALLIED HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS, INC.\nSTATEMENT OF OPERATIONS\nYear ended June 30,\nNet sales\n$\n27,046,587\n$\n36,279,476\n$\n31,894,262\nCost of sales\n24,519,174\n29,169,980\n26,323,646\nGross profit\n2,527,413\n7,109,496\n5,570,616\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n7,107,388\n7,636,318\n8,632,795\nLoss from operations\n(4,579,975)\n(526,822)\n(3,062,179)\nOther (income) expenses:\nInterest expense\n191,450\n115,975\n64,682\nInterest income\n(176)\n(233)\n(654)\nPayroll Protection Program loan forgiveness\n-\n(2,402,236)\n-\nOther, net\n(9,493)\n-\n18,252\n181,781\n(2,286,494)\n82,280\nIncome (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n(4,761,756)\n1,759,672\n(3,144,459)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n599,672\n72,484\n(130,359)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(5,361,428)\n$\n1,687,188\n$\n(3,014,100)\nBasic income (loss) per share:\n$\n(1.34)\n$\n0.42\n$\n(0.75)\nDiluted income (loss) per share:\n$\n(1.34)\n$\n0.42\n$\n(0.75)\nWeighted average shares outstanding - Basic\n4,013,537\n4,013,537\n4,013,537\nWeighted average shares outstanding - Diluted\n4,013,537\n4,026,446\n4,013,537\nSee accompanying Notes to Financial Statements.\nALLIED HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS, INC.\nBALANCE SHEET\nJune 30, 2022\nJune 30, 2021\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n3,317,047\n$\n726,223\nRestricted cash\n1,500,000\n-\nAccounts receivable, net of allowances of $170,000\n2,369,956\n2,929,751\nInventories, net\n8,471,527\n9,450,731\nIncome tax receivable\n-\n9,800\nOther current assets\n423,000\n268,136\nTotal current assets\n16,081,530\n13,384,641\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n3,351,155\n3,727,384\nOperating lease assets\n8,301\n13,078\nRestricted cash\n229,600\n-\nDeferred income taxes\n-\n577,088\nTotal assets\n$\n19,670,586\n$\n17,702,191\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nRevolving credit facility\n$\n2,466,360\n$\n2,077,440\nCurrent portion of financial liability\n131,519\n-\nCurrent portion of operating lease liablity\n5,370\n4,777\nAccounts payable\n1,210,828\n1,898,747\nCustomer deposits\n912,632\n575,930\nOther accrued liabilities\n1,255,490\n2,557,135\nTotal current liabilities\n5,982,199\n7,114,029\nLong-term operating lease liability\n2,931\n8,301\nLong-term portion of financial liability\n7,971,376\n-\nLong-term environmental liability\n480,000\n-\nCommitments and contingencies (Notes 6 and 11)\nStockholders equity:\nPreferred stock;

Organization\nAllied Healthcare Products, Inc. (the Company or Allied) is a manufacturer of respiratory products used in the health care industry in a wide range of hospital and alternate site settings, including post-acute care facilities, home health care and trauma care. The Companys product lines include respiratory care products, medical gas equipment and emergency medical products.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe significant accounting policies followed by the Company are described below.\nUse of estimates\nThe policies utilized by the Company in the preparation of the financial statements conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Companys revenues are derived primarily from the sales of respiratory products, medical gas equipment and emergency medical products. The products are generally sold directly to distributors, customers affiliated with buying groups, individual customers and construction contractors, throughout the world.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales upon satisfaction of its performance obligation which occurs on the transfer of control of the product, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. Payment terms between Allied and its customers vary by the type of customer, country of sale, and the products offered. The term between invoicing and the payment due date is not significant.\nManagement exercises judgment in estimating variable consideration. Provisions for early payment discounts, rebates and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales.\nThe Company provides rebates to wholesalers. Rebate amounts are based upon purchases using contractual amount for each product sold. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate and the customer or price terms that apply. Using known contractual allowances, the Company estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when it records the sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs in the month following the sale.\nThe Company regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and adjusts reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Historically, adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income.\nOther allowances charged against gross sales include cash discounts and returns, which are not significant. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because the Companys historical returns are low, and because sales return terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Product warranties are also not significant.\nThe Company does not allocate transaction price as the Company has only one performance obligation and its contracts do not span multiple periods. All taxes imposed on and concurrent with revenue producing transactions and collected by the Company are excluded from the measurement of transaction price.\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nPromotional and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Statement of Operations. Advertising expenses for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $400, $0, and $3,550, respectively.\nCash and cash equivalents\nFor purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents.\nThe Company maintains funds in bank accounts that, at times, may exceed the limit insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The risk of loss attributable to these uninsured balances is mitigated by depositing funds only in high credit quality financial institutions. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.\nThe Company includes restricted cash along with the cash balance for presentation in the statements of cash flows. The reconciliation between the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows at June 30 is as follows:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n3,317,047\n$\n726,223\nRestricted Cash\n1,729,600\n-\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n5,046,647\n$\n726,223\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash includes cash in escrow that is restricted to capital improvements of the building and payment of rent.\nForeign currency transactions\nAllied has international sales which are denominated in U.S. dollars, the functional currency for these transactions.\nAccounts receivable and concentrations of credit risk\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses based on past experience and an analysis of current amounts due, and historically such losses have been within managements expectations. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the collectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts. Accounts receivable are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when the Company determines that the receivable will not be collected and/or when the account has been referred to a third party collection agency. The Companys customers can be grouped into three main categories: medical equipment distributors, construction contractors and health care institutions. At June 30, 2022, the Company believes that it has no significant concentration of credit risk.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market. If the first-in, first-out method (which approximates replacement cost) had been used in determining cost, inventories would have been $2,951,941 and $2,149,560 higher at June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Changes in the LIFO reserve are included in cost of sales. Cost of sales was reduced by $37,470, $0, and $0 in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively, as a result of LIFO liquidations. Costs in inventory include raw materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead.\nInventory is recorded net of a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory which is determined primarily based on an analysis of inventory items with no usage in the preceding year and for inventory items for which there is greater than two years usage on hand. The reserve for obsolete and excess inventory was $2,413,104 and $2,174,149 at June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 35 years. Expenditures for repairs, maintenance and renewals are charged to income as incurred. Expenditures, which improve an asset or extend its estimated useful life, are capitalized. When properties are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in income.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Company evaluates impairment of long-lived assets under the provisions of ASC Topic 360: Property, Plant and Equipment. ASC 360 provides a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Under ASC 360, if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of such assets, an impairment loss will be recognized. No impairment losses of long-lived assets or identifiable intangibles were recorded by the Company for fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nCollective Bargaining Agreement\nAt June 30, 2022, the Company had approximately 146 full-time employees. Approximately 82 employees in the Companys principal manufacturing facility located in St. Louis, Missouri, are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire on July 31, 2024.\nSelf-insurance\nThe Company maintains a self-insurance program for a portion of its health care costs. Self-insurance costs are accrued based upon the aggregate of the liability for reported claims and the estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $125,000 and $120,000, respectively, of accrued liabilities related to health care claims. In order to establish the self-insurance reserves, the Company utilized actuarial estimates of expected claims based on analyses of historical data.\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe Companys financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, the revolving line of credit and accounts payable. The carrying amounts for cash, accounts receivable, the revolving line of credit and accounts payable approximate their fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under ASC Topic 740: Income Taxes. Under ASC 740, the deferred tax provision is determined using the liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income when such assets and liabilities are anticipated to be settled or realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as tax expense or benefit in the period that includes the enactment date of the change. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance the Company first considers the reversals of existing temporary deferred tax liabilities and available tax planning strategies. To the extent these items are not sufficient to cause the realization of deferred tax assets, the Company considers the availability of future taxable income to the extent such income is considered likely to occur based on the Companys earnings history, current income trends and projections.\nConsidering its history of operating losses, the Company does not rely on the existence of future taxable income as it currently cannot conclude future taxable income is likely to occur. The Company does rely on reversals of existing temporary deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies to the extent available to support the value of its existing deferred tax assets. In 2022, the Company concluded that its previously relied upon tax planning strategies were no longer available to support the value of any deferred tax assets. Accordingly, in 2022 a full valuation allowance was recorded. To the extent the Companys deferred tax assets exceed the amount supportable through reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, a valuation allowance will be recorded against the excess deferred tax assets.\nThe Company recognizes tax liabilities when, despite the Companys belief that its tax return positions are supportable, the Company believes that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Benefits from tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. To the extent the Company deems it necessary to record a liability for its tax positions, the current portion of the liability is included in income taxes payable and the noncurrent portion is included in other liabilities on the balance sheet. If upon the final tax outcome of these matters the ultimate liability is different than the amounts recorded, such differences are reflected in income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. The Company files a federal and multiple state income tax returns. With few exceptions, the Companys federal and state income tax returns are open for fiscal years ending after June 30, 2019.\nThe Company classifies interest expenses on taxes payable as interest expense. Penalties are classified as a component of other expenses.\nResearch and development costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenses for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $260,439, $571,535, and $595,236, respectively.\nEarnings per share\nBasic earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are based on the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the year. The weighted average number of basic shares outstanding for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 4,013,537 shares. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 4,013,537, 4,026,446 and 4,013,537 shares, respectively. The dilutive effect of the Companys employee and director stock option plans are determined by use of the treasury stock method. There are no potential common shares excluded from the calculation of net loss per share, as their effect would be anti-dilutive for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2020. For the year ended June 30, 2021, there was 20,250 potential common shares excluded from the calculation of net income per share, as their effect would be anti-dilutive.\nThe following information is necessary to calculate earnings per share for the periods presented:\nYear ended June 30,\nNet income (loss), as reported\n$\n(5,361,428)\n$\n1,687,188\n$\n(3,014,100)\nWeighted average common shares outstanding\n4,013,537\n4,013,537\n4,013,537\nEffect of dilutive stock options\n-\n12,909\n-\nWeighted average diluted common shares outstanding\n4,013,537\n4,026,446\n4,013,537\nNet income (loss) per common share\nBasic\n$\n(1.34)\n$\n0.42\n$\n(0.75)\nDiluted\n$\n(1.34)\n$\n0.42\n$\n(0.75)\nEmployee stock options excluded from computation of diluted income per share amounts because their effect would be anti-dilutive\n-\n20,250\n-\nEmployee stock-based compensation\nThe company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 718: Compensation - Stock Compensation, which sets accounting requirements for share-based compensation to employees, including employee stock purchase plans, and requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of the stock options and other equity-based compensation.\nThe fair value of options granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following table summarizes the weighted average assumptions utilized in the Black-Scholes option pricing model for options granted during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nWeighted-average fair value\n$\n4.29\n$\n6.44\n$\n0.61\nWeighted-average volatility\n%\n%\n%\nWeighted-average expected life (in years)\n6.0\n6.0\n6.0\nWeighted-average risk-free interest rate\n1.34\n%\n0.52\n%\n1.77\n%\nDividend yield\n%\n%\n%\nExpected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock to estimate future volatility. The risk-free rates are taken from rates as published by the Federal Reserve and represent the yields on actively traded treasury securities for terms equal or approximately equal to the expected terms of the options. The expected term is calculated using the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 107 (ASC 718-10-S99) simplified method. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. The dividend yield is zero based on the fact that the Company has no intention of paying dividends in the near term.\nShare-based compensation expense included in the Statement of Operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $15,647, $14,006 and $2,415, respectively. Unrecognized shared-based compensation cost related to unvested stock options as of June 30, 2022 amounts to approximately $6,000. The cost is expected to be recognized through fiscal 2025.\nThe Company recognized an income tax benefit for share-based compensation arrangements of approximately $6,000, $6,000 and $1,000 respectively for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, all of which were fully offset by an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nNo stock options were exercised during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-13: Financial Instruments - Credit Losses as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2022. This update introduces the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, which requires an entity to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. Under this update, on initial recognition and at each reporting period, an entity is required to recognize an allowance that reflects the entitys current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. ASU 2019-12 was effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2022. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements and related disclosures.\nEnvironmental Remediation\nThe Company is subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including the remediation of contaminated sites. The Companys policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is based on the best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation, cleanup, and monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value.\nOn January 30, 2020, the Company filed a Citizen Participation Plan with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation under its Brownfield Cleanup Program. The plan was filed with respect to the Companys property in Stuyvesant Falls, New York. The plan recognizes that the soil and groundwater at the Stuyvesant Falls facility is impacted by chemical compounds exceeding regulatory standards. On October 13, 2020, the Company executed a Brownfield Cleanup Program Agreement with the Department of Environmental Conservation with respect to the property. Under the agreement, the Company has voluntarily agreed to conduct, at its expense, certain remedial investigations and remedial actions with respect to suspected soil and groundwater contamination at the site with oversight by the department.\nThe Companys best estimate of the expected cost to remediate the site is $1.3 million. The Company recorded $1.1 million as an expense in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 and is reflected in other accrued liabilities and selling, general and administrative expenses in the Companys financial statements. During fiscal 2022, the Company recorded an additional $171,000 charge to income and reclassified $0.5 million to long-term liability to reflect the rescheduling of the remediation. As of June 30, 2022, the Company has paid approximately $634,000 in remediation expenses which have been charged to the reserve.\nRisk and Uncertainties, Going Concern, Liquidity and Managements Plan\nThe Company believes that the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in increased sales of ventilator products in fiscal 2021, however, this peak in demand ended in fiscal 2021 and the impacts of the COVID-19 continue to develop. In fiscal 2022 demand dropped from the peak, and the Company believes that COVID-19 is no longer contributing positively to product demand.\n3. Going Concern\nThe Company follows the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 205-40, Going Concern. This guidance requires an entity to disclose certain information about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related disclosures in certain circumstances. The following information reflects the results of managements assessment, plans, and conclusion of the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nHistorically, the Company has experienced, and continues to experience, losses from operations and net losses. Additionally, the Company expects to incur significant environmental costs that are planned to be expended over the next year (Note 11) and faces several challenges which are currently negatively impacting the Companys operations. Since the onset of the pandemic the Company has found it difficult to hire and retain hourly workers. This has led to the requirement for additional overtime for existing employees, inefficiency, and contributed to delays in shipments.\nThe Company has experienced increasing cost for both raw materials and components. In fiscal year 2021, the Company estimates that inflationary price increases raised product cost by approximately $500,000. In fiscal year 2022, the Company estimates that inflationary price increases raised product cost by an additional $1.3 million dollars. The Company has, where possible, increased prices on certain products to maintain margins at acceptable levels offsetting these cost increases.\nSupply chain, staffing, and management issues have led to higher levels of delayed shipments to customers, lower sales, and an increase in past-due backlog. In the past year, the Company has been unable to produce or obtain product to fulfill its order backlog. Lower sales have resulted in a decrease in earnings and liquidity.\nThe Company is seeking to fill open positions, expedite needed components, improve the performance of management, and find new sources of components where necessary. The Company has engaged a consulting firm to assess and improve its operational capabilities. These actions are intended to mitigate the substantial doubt raised by the Companys historical operating results, and current shipping difficulties.\nThe ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to fulfill its current order backlog and return future order backlogs to historic levels while maintain an adequate gross profit. There is no certainty that the needed improvements can be made. As a result, management of the Company has concluded that this uncertainty creates substantial doubt on the Companys ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as going concern.\n4. Financing\nNorth Mill Loan\nThe Company is party to a Loan and Security Agreement with North Mill Capital, LLC (North Mill), as successor in interest to Summit Financial Resources, L.P., dated effective February 27, 2017, as amended April 16, 2018, April 24, 2019, December 18, 2020, October 7, 2021 and June 13, 2022 (as amended, the Credit Agreement). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company obtained a secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility). The Companys obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by all of the Companys personal property, both tangible and intangible, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. Availability of funds under the Credit Agreement is based on the Companys accounts receivable and inventory but will not exceed $4,000,000. At June 30, 2022 borrowing under the agreement was $2,466,360, maximum available borrowing based on eligible collateral was $3,345,123, resulting in availability of $878,763.\nAvailability of funds under the Credit Agreement is based on the Companys eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory but will not exceed $4,000,000. In determining eligible Accounts Receivable Advances several classifications are considered ineligible and are subtracted from the Companys total Accounts Receivable before calculating eligible Accounts Receivable. Ineligible receivables include receivables from governmental entities, receivables to be paid by credit card, uninsured international receivables, receivables over 90 days old, and receivables from customers with a significant concentration of receivables over 90 days old. The Company may be advanced up to 85% of eligible Accounts Receivable under the loan agreement.\nAccounts Receivable is dependent on sales revenue. Decreased sales revenue has resulted in decreased Accounts Receivable available for loan collateral. At June 30, 2022 the Company had Accounts Receivable of $1,672,581 included as eligible collateral in determining total available borrowing advances under the loan agreement.\nIn determining eligible inventory several categories of inventory are subtracted from total inventory. Work in Process Inventory, Packaging and Supplies, and Inventory Reserves are subtracted from total inventory to calculate eligible inventory. The Company may be advanced up to 25% of eligible inventory. Advances from inventory are limited by the lesser of the calculated eligible inventory, two million dollars ($2,000,000), or the amount advanced from eligible Accounts Receivable. At June 30, 2022 the Company had $1,672,581 from Inventory included as eligible collateral in determining total available borrowing under the loan agreement. At June 30, 2022 Inventory Advances were limited by the eligible Accounts Receivable Advance of $1,672,581.\nThe Credit Facility will be available, subject to its terms, on a revolving basis until it expires on September 30, 2024, at which time all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility will be due and payable. Advances will bear interest at a rate equal to 2.00% in excess of the prime rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal. Interest is computed based on the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days. In addition to interest, the Credit facility requires that the Company pay the lender a monthly administration fee in an amount equal to forty-seven hundredths percent (0.47%) of the average outstanding daily principal amount of loan advances for each calendar month, or portion thereof.\nRegardless of the amount borrowed under the Credit Facility, the Company will pay a minimum amount of .25% (25 basis points) per month on the maximum availability ($10,000 per month).\nUnder the Credit Agreement, advances are generally subject to customary borrowing conditions and to North Mills sole discretion to fund the advances. The Credit Agreement also contains covenants with which the Company must comply during the term of the Credit Facility. Among other things, such covenants require the Company to maintain insurance on the collateral, operate in the ordinary course and not engage in a change of control, dissolve or wind up the Company.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains certain events of default including, without limitation: the failure to make payments when due; the material breach of representations or warranties contained in the Credit Agreement or other loan documents; cross-default with other indebtedness of the Company; the entry of judgments or fines that may have a material adverse effect on the Company; failure to comply with the observance or performance of covenants contained in the Credit Agreement or other loan documents; insolvency of the Company, appointment of a receiver, commencement of bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings; dissolution of the Company; the attachment of any state or federal tax lien; attachment or levy upon or seizure of the Companys property; or any change in the Companys condition that may have a material adverse effect. After an event of default, and upon the continuation thereof, the principal amount of all loans made under the Credit Facility would bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 20.00% above the otherwise applicable interest rate (provided, that the interest rate may not exceed the highest rate permissible under law), and would have the option to accelerate maturity and payment of the Companys obligations under the Credit Facility.\nThe Company was in compliance with all of the covenants associated with the Credit Facility at June 30, 2022.\nPPP Loan\nOn April 13, 2020, the Company entered into a Payroll Protection Program (PPP) loan agreement (the SBA Loan) with Jefferson Bank and Trust Company under the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the SBA). The Company received total proceeds of $2.375 million from the SBA Loan. In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act, the Company used proceeds from the SBA Loan for payroll costs and other permitted uses. The SBA Loan was scheduled to mature on April 13, 2022 and had a 1.00% interest rate and is subject to the terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration under the CARES Act.\nThe loan, including all principal and accrued interest, was forgiven on June 11, 2021.\nThe company elected to account for the PPP Loan using FASB ASC 470, Debt. The related forgiveness income is included in other income for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nAccording to the rules of the SBA, the Company is required to retain PPP Loan documentation for six years after the date the loan is forgiven or repaid in full, and permit authorized representatives of the SBA, including representatives of its Office of Inspector General, to access such files upon request. Should the SBA conduct such a review and reject all or some of the Companys judgments pertaining to satisfying PPP Loan eligibility or forgiveness conditions, the Company may be required to adjust previously reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\nAt June 30, 2022, the Company had $10.6 million indebtedness, including lease obligations, financial liabilty and short-term debt. The prime rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal was 4.75% on June 30, 2022.\n5. Sale-Leaseback Financing Transaction\nOn June 16, 2022 the Company sold the Companys headquarters and manufacturing facilities located at 1720 Sublette Avenue in St. Louis, Missouri. Simultaneously, the Company entered into a lease agreement with the buyer of the property (the sale of the property and simultaneous leaseback is referred to as the Sale-Leaseback). The Sale-Leaseback is repayable over a 15-year and ten day term, with five renewal options of five years each. Under the terms of the lease agreement, the Companys initial basic rent is approximately $57,400 per month, with annual increases of approximately 2% each year of the initial term.\nThe Company accounted for the Sale-Leaseback as a financing transaction with the purchaser of the property in accordance with ASC 842 as the lease agreement was determined to be a finance lease. The Company concluded the lease agreement met the qualifications to be classified as a finance lease due to the significance of the present value of the lease payments, using a discount rate of 6.75% to reflect the Companys incremental borrowing rate, compared to the fair value of the leased property as of the lease commencement date.\nThe presence of a finance lease indicates that control of the St. Louis property has not transferred to the buyer/lessor and, as such, the transaction was deemed a failed sale-leaseback and must be accounted for as a financing arrangement. As a result of this determination, the Company is viewed as having received the sales proceeds from the buyer/lessor in the form of a hypothetical loan collateralized by its leased facilities. The hypothetical loan is payable as principal and interest in the form of lease payments to the buyer/lessor. As such, the Company will not derecognize the property from its books for accounting purposes until the lease ends.\nAs of June 30, 2022, the carrying value of the financing liability was $8,102,895, net of $212,667 in debt issuance costs, of which $131,519 was classified as current on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with $7,971,376 classified as long-term. The monthly lease payments are split between a reduction of principal and interest expense using the effective interest rate method. Interest expense associated with the financing arrangement was $15,585 for the year ended June 30, 2022. No gain or loss was recognized related to the Sale-Leaseback under U.S. GAAP for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.\nPursuant to the agreement for the sale of the St. Louis headquarters property, $1,500,000 of the purchase price (the Improvement Escrow) is subject to an escrow agreement to pay for the repair and/or replacement of certain agreed upon work, including the roof, HVAC system and certain lighting in the offices. Any funds remaining in the Improvement Escrow will be paid to the Company when the improvements are substantially completed. Pursuant to the lease, an amount equal to four months of initial rental payments ($229,600) is being held in escrow to guaranty the payment by the Company of rent for the first two years of this lease. Any funds remaining in the rent escrow will be paid to the Company on July 1, 2024. As of June 30, 2022, the carrying value of restricted cash from this transaction was $1,729,600.\nThe Company will depreciate the building down to zero over the remaining economic life of the property so that at the end of the financing liability term, the remaining carrying amount of the financing liability will equal the carrying amount of the land of $873,200.\nRemaining future cash payments related to the financing liability, assuming the exercise of two renewal options of five years each, for the fiscal years ending June 30 are as follows:\n$\n688,800\n702,576\n716,628\n730,960\n745,579\nThereafter\n19,359,359\nTotal Minimum Liability Payments\n22,943,902\nImputed Interest\n(14,841,007)\nTotal\n$\n8,102,895\n6. Lease Commitments\nThe Company leases vehicles and equipment, generally for terms of three to five years.\nThe Company follows the requirements of ASC Topic 842, Leases (ASC 842 or Topic 842). The Company has elected to not apply the recognition requirements in Topic 842 to short-term leases (i.e., leases of 12 months or less). Instead, as permitted by Topic 842, the Company recognizes the lease payments under its short-term leases in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company elected this accounting policy for all classes of underlying assets. Right-of-use assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company generally uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value.\nAs of June 30, 2022, the Company had vehicles and equipment financed under operating leases with lease terms expiring through 2024. Rent expense consists of monthly rental payments under the terms of the Companys lease agreements recognized on a straight-line basis.\nThe following table sets forth the Companys future minimum lease payments under operating lease liabilities recorded on the Companys balance sheet as of June 30, 2022.\nMaturity of\nOperating Lease\nFiscal years ending\nLiabilities\n6,065\n3,032\nTotal lease payments\n9,097\nLess: amounts representing interest\nPresent value of lease liabilities\n8,301\nLess: current portion\n5,370\nLong-term portion\n$\n2,931\nThe Companys operating lease cost amounted to $71,234 in 2022 and $59,432 in 2021.

In addition, the Company has state tax net operating losses of approximately $8.3 million that expire in varying years from 2022 through 2042 and $0.8 million subject to indefinite carryforward.\nThe Company files a federal and multiple state income tax returns. With few exceptions the Companys federal and state income tax returns are open for fiscal years ending after June 30, 2019.\nThe Company has not taken any uncertain tax positions on its federal or state income tax filings for open tax years.\n8. Employee Retirement Benefits\nThe Company offers a retirement savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code to certain eligible salaried employees. Each employee may elect to enter a written salary deferral agreement under which a portion of such employees pre-tax earnings may be contributed to the plan.\nDuring the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company made contributions of $182,026, $186,366, and $185,000, respectively, to the retirement savings plan. The Company contributes 2% of eligible salaried employees annual income to the plan. In addition, the Company provides a 25% match on the first 8% of employee deferrals for eligible employees.\nThe risk of participating in multi-employer pension plan is different from single-employer plans. Assets contributed to a multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.\nThe Companys participation in a multi-employer pension plan for the year ended June 30, 2022, is outlined in the table below. The EIN/PN column provides the Employee Identification Number (EIN) and the three-digit plan number (PN). The audit of the pension plan for the year ended June 30, 2021 is not yet completed. The most recent Pension Protection Act (PPA) zone status for 2020 and 2019 is for the plan year-ends as indicated below. The zone status is based on information that the Company obtained from the annual funding notice for District No. 9 International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Pension Trust. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are less than 65 percent funded, plans in the yellow zone are between 65 and 80 percent funded, and plans in the green zone are at least 80 percent funded. The FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (FIP) or a rehabilitation plan (RP) is either pending or has been implemented. In addition to regular plan contributions, the Company may be subject to a surcharge if the plan is in the red zone. The Surcharge Imposed column indicates whether a surcharge has been imposed on contributions to the plan. The last column lists the expiration date(s) of the collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) to which the plan is subject.\nPPA Zone Status\nContributions by the Company\nFIP/RP\nStatus\nPending/\nSurcharge\nExpiration\nPension Trust Fund\nEIN/PN\nImplemented\nImposed\nDate of CBA\nDistrict No. 9\n51-0138317/001\nYellow\nYellow\nImplemented\nInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Pension Plan\n12/31/2020\n12/31/2019\nYes\n$\n321,011\n$\n315,342\n$\n245,824\nNo\n7/31/2024\nThe Company was not listed in the Form 5500 for the above plan as of the plan year ends as providing more than 5 percent of total contributions.\nUnder federal pension law, a plan generally is in endangered status if its funded percentage is less than 80% (other factors may apply).\nIf a pension plan enters endangered status, the trustees of the plan are required to adopt a funding improvement plan. Funding improvement plans establish benchmarks for pension plans to improve their funding status over a specified period of time.\nThe plan was first certified as being in endangered status in the 2019 Plan Year because the Plan was projected to have a funding deficiency in the 2023 Plan Year. The Plan continues to be in endangered status in the 2020 Plan Year because funding improvement plan contribution rate increases are required to eliminate the Plans projected deficiency.\nIn an effort to improve the Plans funding situation, the Board of Trustees adopted a funding improvement plan that includes increases in the contribution by employers and/or decreases in the benefit accrual rate for members.\nAs a result, Allied Healthcare Products, Inc. and District 9 of the International Association of Machinist were required to collectively bargain the required Contribution Rate Increase and the impact on the Future Benefit Accrual. On June 30, 2021 the two parties reached agreement on the Funding Improvement Plan. Under the plan, future benefit accruals are eliminated for members and the monthly employer contribution rate will increase by 80%. Additional contributions under the plan began on December 1, 2021.\n9. Stock Based Compensation\nThe Company has established a 2005 Directors Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan and a 2013 Incentive Plan for Non-Employee Directors (collectively the Directors Plans). The Directors Plans provide for the granting of options to the Companys directors who are not employees of the Company to purchase shares of common stock at prices equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. Options to purchase up to 75,000 shares of common stock may be granted under the Directors Plans. Options shall become exercisable with respect to one-fourth of the shares covered thereby on each anniversary of the date of grant, commencing on the second anniversary of the date granted, except for certain options which become exercisable with respect to all of the shares covered thereby one year after the grant date. The right to exercise the options expires in ten years from the date of grant, or earlier if an option holder ceases to be a director of the Company.\nUpon stock-settled compensation exercises and awards, the Company issues new shares of common stock.\nA summary of stock option transactions in fiscal 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, pursuant to the Employee Plans and the Directors Plans is as follows:\nWeighted\nAverage\nWeighted\nRemaining\nAggregate\nAverage\nContractual\nIntrinsic\nShares\nExercise Price\nTerm (years)\nValue\nJune 30, 2019\n45,000\n$\n5.52\nOptions Granted\n7,500\n$\n1.20\nOptions Exercised\n-\n$\n0.00\nOptions Forfeited or Expired\n(9,750)\n$\n6.00\nJune 30, 2020\n42,750\n$\n4.65\n4.1\n$\n304,768\nOptions Granted\n3,000\n$\n7.86\nOptions Exercised\n-\n$\n0.00\nOptions Forfeited or Expired\n(2,250)\n$\n8.68\nJune 30, 2021\n43,500\n$\n4.66\n3.8\n$\n41,915\nOptions Granted\n3,000\n$\n5.09\nOptions Exercised\n-\n$\n0.00\nOptions Forfeited or Expired\n(17,250)\n$\n7.01\nJune 30, 2022\n29,250\n$\n3.32\n5.6\n$\n3,200\nExercisable at June 30, 2022\n22,500\n$\n3.44\n4.7\n$\n1,663\nThe following table provides additional information for options outstanding and exercisable at June 30, 2022:\nOptions Outstanding\nWeighted Average\nWeighted Average\nRange of Exercise Prices\nNumber\nRemaining Life\nExercise Price\n$1.17 - 1.99\n7,500\n7.5 years\n$\n1.20\n$2.00 - 3.99\n11,250\n4.4 years\n$\n2.42\n$4.00 - 7.86\n10,500\n5.4 years\n$\n5.80\n$1.17 - 7.86\n29,250\n5.6 years\n$\n3.32\nOptions Exercisable\nWeighted Average\nRange of Exercise Prices\nNumber\nExercise Price\n$1.17 - 1.99\n3,750\n$\n1.19\n$2.00 - 3.99\n11,250\n$\n2.42\n$4.00 -7.86\n7,500\n$\n6.08\n$1.17 - 7.86\n22,500\n$\n3.44\nSee Note 2 for discussion of accounting for stock awards and related fair value disclosures.\n10.

Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Claims\nThe Company is subject to various investigations, claims and legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. The Company intends to continue to conduct business in such a manner as to avert any FDA action seeking to interrupt or suspend manufacturing or require any recall or modification of products.\nThe Company has recognized the costs and associated liabilities only for those investigations, claims and legal proceedings for which, in its view, it is probable that liabilities have been incurred and the related amounts are estimable. Based upon information currently available, management believes that existing accrued liabilities are sufficient.\nStuyvesant Falls Remediation\nOn January 30, 2020, the Company filed a Citizen Participation Plan with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation under its Brownfield Cleanup Program. The plan was filed with respect to the Companys property in Stuyvesant Falls, New York. The plan recognizes that the soil and groundwater at the Stuyvesant Falls facility is impacted by chemical compounds exceeding regulatory standards. On October 13, 2020, the Company executed a Brownfield Cleanup Program Agreement with the Department of Environmental Conservation with respect to the property. Under the agreement, the Company has voluntarily agreed to conduct, at its expense, certain remedial investigations and remedial actions with respect to suspected soil and groundwater contamination at the site with oversight by the department.\nThe Companys best estimate of the expected cost to remediate the site is $1.3 million. The Company recorded $1.1 million as an expense in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 and is reflected in other accrued liabilities and selling, general and administrative expenses in the Companys financial statements. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company recorded an additional $171,000. As of June 30, 2022, the Company has paid approximately $634,000 in remediation expenses which have been charged to the initial reserve.\nVendor Demand Letter\nOn June 22, 2022, the Company received a demand letter from one of its vendors, International Control Services, Inc. (ICS) for $586,000 as payment on outstanding ICS invoices. The invoices in question cover components which the Company rejected as defective, certain charges for prior years and purchases the Company cancelled which ICS claims were non-cancellable. The Companys standard purchase orders provide that the Company may reject defective parts and that all purchases are cancellable by the Company for its convenience. The Company disputes all of ICSs claims, including that any portion of the subject purchases were non-cancellable. No litigation has been commenced as of this filing, but the Company will defend any such lawsuit. The Company notes that the range of loss is between $0 and $586,000. The Company has not recorded a provision for this matter because, at this early stage, there is insufficient information to determine the likelihood of loss or to estimate any possible loss.\nLiability for future environmental expenditures\nBeginning Balance\n$\n976,720\n$\n1,037,000\nCharges to income\n170,552\n-\nRemedial and investigatory spending\n491,210\n60,280\nEnding Balance\n$\n656,062\n$\n976,720\nReflected in the Balance sheet as:\nCurrent, included in Other Liabilities\n$\n176,062\n$\n976,720\nLong-term environmental\n480,000\n-\nTotal\n$\n656,062\n$\n976,720\nEmployment Contract\nOn April 20, 2021, the Company entered into an employment contract with its chief executive officer, Joseph F. Ondrus, Jr., which provides for an initial term of three years with annual renewals. The contract includes termination without cause and change of control provisions, under which the chief executive officer is entitled to continued payments of annual salary and benefits if the Company terminates his employment without cause or he voluntarily terminates his employment with good reason. Good Reason generally includes changes in the scope of his duties or location of employment but also includes (i) the Companys written election not to renew the Employment Agreement and (ii) certain voluntary resignations by the chief executive officer following a Change of Control as defined in the Agreement.\n12. Segment Information\nThe Company operates in one segment consisting of the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of a variety of respiratory products used in the health care industry to hospitals, hospital equipment dealers, hospital construction contractors, home health care dealers and emergency medical product dealers. The Companys product lines include respiratory care products, medical gas equipment and emergency medical products. The Company does not have any one single customer that represents more than 10 percent of total sales.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, as required under Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the date of such evaluation to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SECs rules and forms.\n(b) Internal control over financial reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, which is defined as a process designed by, or under supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. However these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. It is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, the risk that misstatements are not prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of June 30, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nThere were no changes to the Companys internal controls over financial reporting during the fourth quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Companys internal controls over financial reporting.
