    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral Overview\nPanamera Holdings Corporation (Panamera or the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 20, 2014, as Panamera Healthcare Corporation. On October 21, 2021, we changed our name to Panamera Holdings Corporation and increased the number of our authorized shares from 200,000,000 shares to 600,000,000 shares, par value $0.0001 per share, of which 550,000,000 were common stock and 50,000,000 were preferred stock.\nThe Company originally intended to offer management and consulting services to healthcare organizations, but current management has redirected efforts now to pursuing business opportunities including but not limited to the environmental services industry, emerging innovative technologies and individual health choices led by innovation with integration. To date, the Companys activities have been limited to its formation and the raising of equity capital and providing consulting services to a healthcare company and activities in the scrap metal business..\nOur Current Business\nWe are currently seeking new business opportunities with established operating business entities to merge with or to acquire with our primary emphasis in the environmental services industry, emerging innovative technologies and individual health choices led by innovation with integration. In certain instances, a target business may wish to become our subsidiary, or may wish to contribute assets to us rather than merge with us. We have begun negotiations but not entered into any definitive agreements for potential new business opportunities, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into any definitive agreements.\nAny new acquisition or business opportunities that we may acquire will require additional financing. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to acquire the financing necessary to enable us to pursue our plan of operation. If our Company requires additional financing and we are unable to acquire such funds, our business may fail.\nManagement of our Company believes that there are benefits to being a reporting company with a class of securities quoted on the OTC Markets, such as: (i) the ability to use securities to acquire assets or businesses which can then be registered\u037e (ii) increased visibility in the financial community\u037e (iii) the facilitation of borrowing from financial institutions\u037e (iv) potentially improved trading efficiency\u037e (v) potential stockholder liquidity\u037e (vi) potentially greater ease in raising capital subsequent to an acquisition\u037e (vii) potential compensation of key employees through stock awards or options\u037e (viii) potentially enhanced corporate image\u037e and (ix) a presence in the United States capital market.\nWe may seek a business opportunity with entities that have recently commenced operations, or entities who wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital to expand business development activities, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. We may acquire assets and establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries.\nIn implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition or opportunity, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon the consummation of a transaction, it is anticipated that our officers and directors will continue to manage the Company\u037e however, any potential business combination candidate may require a change of management as a condition of the combination.\nAs of the date hereof, we have not entered into any formal written agreements for a business combination or opportunity. When any such agreement is reached, we intend to disclose such an agreement by filing a current report on Form 8-K.\nWe anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and without certainty of success. Business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Business opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of our Company may be scarce and or we may be unable to participate in an opportunity of our choosing. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities.\nCurrently, we have one source of revenue, a consulting agreement with a healthcare organization, which is described below under Consulting Agreement. We are not able to fund our cash requirements through our current operations. We have been reliant on a company controlled by our CEO and Chairman, T. Benjamin Jennings, to provide financial contributions and services to keep the Company operating. Further, we believe that our Company may have difficulties raising capital from other sources until we locate a prospective business combination candidate through which we can pursue our plan of operation. If we are unable to secure adequate capital to continue our acquisition efforts, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment and our business may fail. We currently have no written or oral agreement from our majority shareholder, officers or directors, to continue to provide financial contributions.\nConsulting Agreement\nOn May 18, 2022, we entered into a Consulting Agreement with (First DP and the Consulting Agreement), which is controlled by Jay Medley. Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, First DP engaged the Company to provide consulting services in the field of healthcare beginning on March 1, 2022. The services include (1) clinical related issues while acting as a medium between physicians and member representatives; (2) observing and recommending supportive chronic disease, wellness and other programs that will further enhance offerings and bringing various referral partners together to streamline cash/direct pay for members; (3) attending events and representing First DP at those events to drive new business and to form relationships with critical industry partners to increase employer sponsored memberships; (4) meeting with strategic entities to develop partnerships that result in memberships through their organization; (5) networking at local, regional, and state events to generate employer leads for First DP; (6) sourcing and meeting with primary care physicians for the purposes of recruiting more doctors for First DP; (7) meeting with non-revenue generating partners and bringing concepts back to First DP to drive better member experiences, doctor retention and customary acquisition; (8) meeting with VCs, private equity and other strategic partners for the purposes of capital raising and introductions; and (9) identifying acquisition targets and greenfield opportunities for First DP.\nAs compensation for services rendered pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, First DP agreed to pay us $8,333 per month, as well as sales commissions, including $100 for each new employee which signs up for First DPs primary care membership and an amount equal to the first months membership fee, for each employee which signs up for First DPs virtual primary care membership.\nFirst DP is also required to reimburse our expenses, provide primary healthcare for Chris Barakat, our director and his immediate family at cost, and reimbursement, with First DPs approval, for Mr. Barakats tuition, travel, and other costs in connection with his formal education, training and related activities.\nThe Consulting Agreement includes customary indemnification and confidentiality obligations.\nResearch and Development\nWe have incurred $Nil in research and development expenditures over the last two fiscal years.\nIntellectual Property\nWe do not currently have any intellectual property, other than our domain name and website, https://panameraholdings.com, which website and the information thereon we are not incorporating by reference into this Report.\nEmployees\nAs of July 31, 2023, we have an employment agreement with Christopher Barakat, a member of our board of directors. The other officers and directors are donating their time to the development of our company and are able to fulfill part-time requirements.\nWe have no other employees, and do not foresee hiring additional employees in the near future. We will be engaging independent contractors as needed who, under our direction, will fulfil the requirements of engagements that exceed our officers time constraints.\nAvailable Information\nWe file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our SEC filings are available to the public over the Internet at the SECs website at www.sec.gov. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC like us at www.sec.gov. Our internet address is https://panameraholdings.com. Information on our website is not part of this Report, and we do not desire to incorporate by reference such information herein. Copies of documents filed by us with the SEC are also available from us without charge, upon oral or written request to our Secretary, who can be contacted at the address and telephone number set forth on the cover page of this Report. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the other information in this filing before deciding to invest in our company. Any of the risk factors described below could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently considered to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, the trading price or value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations:\nWe require additional financing, and we may not be able to raise funds on favorable terms or at all, which raises questions about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs of July 31, 2023, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, has an accumulated deficit of $7,522,698 and earned limited revenues of $100,001 for the year ended July 31, 2023. With our current cash on hand, expected revenues, and based on our current average monthly expenses, we currently anticipate the need for additional funding in order to continue our operations at their current levels and to pay the costs associated with being a public company for the next 12 months. We may also require additional funding in the future to expand or complete acquisitions. The most likely source of future funds presently available to us will be through the sale of equity capital and related party advances, provided that none are currently planned and no related parties are required to fund our operations. Any sale of share capital will result in dilution to existing stockholders. Furthermore, we may incur debt in the future, and may not have sufficient funds to repay our future indebtedness or may default on our future debts, jeopardizing our business viability.\nThese conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The financial statements included herein also include a going concern footnote from our auditors.\nWe may not be able to borrow or raise additional capital in the future to meet our needs or to otherwise provide the capital necessary to expand our operations and business, which might result in the value of our common stock decreasing in value or becoming worthless. Additional financing may not be available to us on terms that are acceptable. Consequently, we may not be able to proceed with our intended business plans. Substantial additional funds will still be required if we are to reach our goals that are outlined in this Report. Obtaining additional financing contains risks, including:\n\u00b7\nadditional equity financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms and any equity we are able to issue could lead to dilution for current stockholders;\n\u00b7\nloans or other debt instruments may have terms and/or conditions, such as interest rate, restrictive covenants and control or revocation provisions, which are not acceptable to management or our directors;\n\u00b7\nthe current environment in capital markets combined with our capital constraints may prevent us from being able to obtain adequate debt financing; and\n\u00b7\nif we fail to obtain required additional financing, we will need to delay or scale back our business plan, reduce our operating costs, or reduce our headcount, each of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, future prospects, and financial condition.\nWe have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by inflation.\nIncreases in inflation have had an adverse effect on our results of operations. Current and future inflationary effects may be driven by, among other things, supply chain disruptions and governmental stimulus or fiscal policies, and geopolitical instability, including the ongoing conflict between the Ukraine and Russia, and the conflict in Israel. Continuing increases in inflation, have in the past, and could in the future, impact our costs of labor, equipment, material costs and services and the margins, all of which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Inflation has also resulted in higher interest rates, which in turn raises our cost of debt borrowing.\nBecause we have a limited operating history our future operations may not result in profitable operations.\nThere is no significant operating history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and we may never achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail. As of July 31, 2023, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, has an accumulated deficit of $7,522,698 and earned limited revenues of $100,001 for the year ended July 31, 2023. We may not have profitable operations in the future to ensure our continuation.\nWe rely on our management and if they were to leave our company our business plan could be adversely affected.\nWe are largely dependent upon the personal efforts and abilities of our existing management, who play an active role in our operations. Moving forward, should the services of such persons be lost for any reason, the Company will incur costs associated with recruiting replacements and any potential delays in operations which this may cause. If we are unable to replace such individual with a suitably trained alternative individual(s), we may be forced to scale back or curtail our business plan. If our executive officers do not devote sufficient time towards our business, we may never be able to effectuate our business plan.\nOur operating results may fluctuate due to factors that are difficult to forecast and not within our control.\nOur past operating results may not be accurate indicators of future performance, and you should not rely on such results to predict our future performance. Our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past, and could fluctuate in the future. Factors that may contribute to fluctuations include:\n\u00b7\nchanges in aggregate capital spending, cyclicality and other economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nour ability to effectively manage our working capital;\n\u00b7\nour ability to generate increased demand in our targeted markets, particularly those in which we have limited experience;\n\u00b7\nglobal epidemics and pandemics and the U.S.s responses thereto;\n\u00b7\npricing and availability of labor and materials;\n\u00b7\nincreases in inflation and interest rates;\n\u00b7\ndeclines in local, U.S. and global economic activities, including potential rescissions;\n\u00b7\nour inability to adjust certain fixed costs and expenses for changes in demand and the timing and significance of expenditures that may be incurred to facilitate our growth;\n\u00b7\nseasonal fluctuations in demand and our revenue; and\n\u00b7\ndisruption in the supply of materials.\nOur executive officer controls a majority of our voting securities and therefore he has the ability to influence matters affecting our stockholders.\nT. Benjamin Jennings, our President, Chief Executive Officer and director, beneficially owns approximately 65.6% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, he controls approximately a majority of the stockholder vote. As a result, he has the ability to influence matters affecting our stockholders and will therefore exercise control in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including the election of directors, mergers, consolidations, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control. Any investor who purchases shares will be a minority stockholder and as such will have little to no say in the direction of the Company and the election of directors. Additionally, it will be difficult if not impossible for investors to remove our current directors, which will mean they will remain in control of who serves as officers of the Company as well as whether any changes are made in the Board of Directors. As a potential investor in the Company, you should keep in mind that even if you own shares of the Companys common stock and wish to vote them at annual or special stockholder meetings, your shares will likely have little effect on the outcome of corporate decisions. Because Mr. Jennings controls the vote on all stockholder matters, investors may find it difficult to replace our management if they disagree with the way our business is being operated. Additionally, the interests of Mr. Jennings may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and thus result in corporate decisions that are adverse to other stockholders.\nWe compete with many other companies in the market for healthcare management and consulting services which may result in lower prices for our services, reduced operating margins and an inability to maintain or increase our market share.\nWe compete with other companies in a highly fragmented market that includes national, regional and local service providers, as well as service providers with global operations. These companies have services that are similar to ours, and certain of these companies have substantially greater financial resources than we do. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors or timely implement new services. Increased competition and cost pressures affecting the healthcare markets in general may result in lower prices for our services, reduced operating margins and the inability to maintain or increase our market share.\nAll of our current revenues are derived from a Consulting Agreement with a related party.\nWe currently derive all of our revenue from the Consulting Agreement with First DP Ventures, LP, DBA First Primary Care, which is controlled by Jay Medley. In the event the Consulting Agreement is terminated or the interests of Mr. Medley differ from other stockholders, that agreement may be terminated by them, which would materially impact our business.\nRegulatory, corporate governance and reporting risks:\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. If not remediated, our failure to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements, a failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations, loss of revenue and theft, and such failure to maintain ineffective controls and procedures has already resulted in, and may in the future result in, a non-approved transaction, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements. As reported under Item 4. Controls and Procedures, as of July 31, 2023, our Companys Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) (our principal financial and accounting officer), have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Separately, as of July 31, 2023, management has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. We determined that we had a material weakness because, the Company has no formal control process related to the identification and approval of related party transactions and because, as a result of limited resources, we did not maintain proper segregation of incompatible duties, namely the lack of an audit committee, an understaffed financial and accounting function, and the need for additional personnel to prepare and analyze financial information in a timely manner and to allow review and on-going monitoring and enhancement of our controls. The effect of the lack of segregation of duties potentially affects multiple processes and procedures.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A control deficiency exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.\nMaintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting are necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements and the Company is committed to remediating its material weaknesses in such controls as promptly as possible. However, there can be no assurance as to when these material weaknesses will be remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future. Any failure to remediate the material weaknesses, or the development of new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting and financial obligations, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock, and/or result in litigation against us or our management. In addition, even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures, those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or facilitate the fair presentation of our financial statements or our periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nBecause we are not subject to compliance with rules requiring the adoption of certain corporate governance measures, our stockholders have limited protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rule changes proposed and enacted by the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange and The Nasdaq Stock Market, as a result of Sarbanes-Oxley, require the implementation of various measures relating to corporate governance. These measures are designed to enhance the integrity of corporate management and the securities markets and apply to securities that are listed on those exchanges or The Nasdaq Stock Market. Because we are not presently required to comply with many of the corporate governance provisions and because we chose to avoid incurring the substantial additional costs associated with such compliance any sooner than legally required, we have not yet adopted these measures.\nWe do not currently have an independent audit or compensation committee. As a result, our directors have the ability to, among other things, determine their own level of compensation. Until we comply with such corporate governance measures, regardless of whether such compliance is required, the absence of such standards of corporate governance may leave our stockholders without protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest, if any, and similar matters and any potential investors may be reluctant to provide us with funds necessary to expand our operations.\nWe intend to comply with all corporate governance measures relating to director independence as and when required. However, we may find it very difficult or be unable to attract and retain qualified officers, directors and members of board committees required to provide for our effective management as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has resulted in a series of rules and regulations by the SEC that increase responsibilities and liabilities of directors and executive officers. The perceived increased personal risk associated with these recent changes may make it more costly or deter qualified individuals from accepting these roles.\nRisks relating to our common stock:\nStockholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock.\nWe have no committed source of financing. Wherever possible, our board of directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash consideration will consist of restricted shares of our common stock. Our board of directors has authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock. In addition, if a trading market develops for our common stock, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market. These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders, may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing managements ability to maintain control of the Company because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management.\nThere is currently a limited public market for our common stock, which is volatile, sporadic and an illiquid market.\nTo date only a limited number of shares of our common stock have traded and a significant market may not develop in the future. If for any reason a more robust public trading market does not develop, stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares of common stock should they desire to do so.\nEven if a more significant trading market develops, we cannot predict how liquid that market might become. The trading price of our common stock, if any, in the future, is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThese factors include:\n\u00b7\nQuarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nAnnouncements by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nDisruption to our operations;\n\u00b7\nCommencement of, or our involvement in, litigation;\n\u00b7\nAny major change in our board or management;\n\u00b7\nChanges in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals; and\n\u00b7\nGeneral market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our own operating performance.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such public companies. Such fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the future. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This type of litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources.\nWe also currently have a volatile, sporadic and illiquid market for our common stock, which is subject to wide fluctuations in response to several factors, including those discussed above. Our stock price may also be impacted by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. These market fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, global epidemics or pandemics, interest rates or international currency fluctuations may adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our common stock.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends in the past and have no plans to issue cash dividends in the future, which could cause the value of our common stock to have a lower value than other similar companies which do pay cash dividends.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not anticipate any cash dividends being paid to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. While our dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of the business, it is anticipated that any earnings will be retained to finance our future expansion. As we have no plans to issue cash dividends in the future, our common stock could be less desirable to other investors and as a result, the value of our common stock may decline, or fail to reach the valuations of other similarly situated companies who have historically paid cash dividends in the past.\nOur common stock is considered a penny stock under SEC rules and it may be more difficult to resell securities classified as penny stock.\nOur common stock is a penny stock under applicable SEC rules (generally defined as non-exchange traded stock with a per-share price below $5.00). Unless we maintain a per-share price above $5.00 (or obtain a listing on a national securities exchange), our common stock will continue to be a penny stock. These rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that recommend the purchase or sale of penny stocks to persons other than those who qualify as established customers or accredited investors. For example, broker-dealers must determine the appropriateness for non-qualifying persons of investments in penny stocks. Broker-dealers must also provide, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, disclose the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, furnish monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account, provide a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser, and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction.\nLegal remedies available to an investor in penny stocks may include the following:\n\u00b7\nIf a penny stock is sold to the investor in violation of the requirements listed above, or other Federal or states securities laws, the investor may be able to cancel the purchase and receive a refund of the investment.\n\u00b7\nIf a penny stock is sold to the investor in a fraudulent manner, the investor may be able to sue the persons and firms that committed the fraud for damages.\nThese requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of our securities. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to resell our common stock.\nMany brokerage firms will discourage or refrain from recommending investments in penny stocks. Most institutional investors will not invest in penny stocks. In addition, many individual investors will not invest in penny stocks due to, among other reasons, the increased financial risk generally associated with these investments.\nFor these reasons, penny stocks may have a limited market and, consequently, limited liquidity. We can give no assurance at what time, if ever, our common stock will not be classified as a penny stock in the future.\nWe have established preferred stock which can be designated by the Companys Board of Directors without stockholder approval.\nWe have authorized capital stock consisting of 550,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share. As of the date of this Report, we have 35,410,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and no outstanding shares of preferred stock. The shares of preferred stock of the Company may be issued from time to time in one or more series, each of which shall have a distinctive designation or title as shall be determined by the board of directors of the Company prior to the issuance of any shares thereof. The preferred stock may have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof as adopted by the board of directors. Because the board of directors is able to designate the powers and preferences of the preferred stock without the vote of a majority of the Companys stockholders, stockholders of the Company will have no control over what designations and preferences the Companys preferred stock will have. Investors should keep in mind that the board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of common stock and preferred stock, which could cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. Additionally, the dilutive effect of any preferred stock, which we may issue may be exacerbated given the fact that such preferred stock may have super majority voting rights and/or other rights or preferences which could provide the preferred stockholders with voting control over us subsequent to such offering and/or give those holders the power to prevent or cause a change in control. As a result, the issuance of shares of common stock and/or preferred stock may cause the value of our securities to decrease and/or become worthless.\nGeneral risk factors:\nOur ability to grow and compete in the future will be adversely affected if adequate capital is not available.\nThe ability of our business to grow and compete depends on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn depends in large part on our cash flow from operations and the availability of equity and debt financing. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient or we may not be able to obtain equity or debt financing on acceptable terms or at all to implement our growth strategy. As a result, adequate capital may not be available to finance our current growth plans, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could harm our business.\nIf we are unable to manage future growth effectively, our profitability and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to achieve our desired growth depends on our execution in functional areas such as management, sales and marketing, finance and general administration and operations. To manage any future growth, we must continue to improve our operational and financial processes and systems and expand, train and manage our employee base and control associated costs. Our efforts to grow our business, both in terms of size and in diversity of customer bases served, will require rapid expansion in certain functional areas and put a significant strain on our resources. We may incur significant expenses as we attempt to scale our resources and make investments in our business that we believe are necessary to achieve long-term growth goals. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our expenses could increase without a proportionate increase in revenue, our margins could decrease, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we make any acquisitions, they may disrupt or have a negative impact on our business.\nIf we make acquisitions in the future, funding permitting, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, we could have difficulty integrating the acquired companys assets, personnel and operations with our own. We do not anticipate that any acquisitions or mergers we may enter into in the future would result in a change of control of the Company. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired business may not be willing to work for us. We cannot predict the effect expansion may have on our core business. Regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition, the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses. In addition to the risks described above, acquisitions are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u00b7\nthe difficulty of integrating acquired products, services or operations;\n\u00b7\nthe potential disruption of the ongoing businesses and distraction of our management and the management of acquired companies;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u00b7\nthe potential impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe potential inability or failure to achieve additional sales and enhance our customer base through cross-marketing of the products to new and existing customers;\n\u00b7\nthe effect of any government regulations which relate to the business acquired;\n\u00b7\npotential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses or product lines, or the need to spend significant amounts to retool, reposition or modify the marketing and sales of acquired products or operations, or the defense of any litigation, whether or not successful, resulting from actions of the acquired company prior to our acquisition; and\n\u00b7\npotential expenses under the labor, environmental and other laws of various jurisdictions.\nOur business could be severely impaired if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition, many of which cannot be presently identified. These risks and problems could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe incur ongoing costs and expenses for SEC reporting and compliance and without sufficient revenues we may not be able to remain in compliance, making it difficult for investors to sell their shares, if at all.\nIn order for us to remain in compliance with our on-going reporting requirements, we may require additional capital and/or future revenues to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources or require us to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity or debt. If we are unable to further capitalize the Company or generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance, it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. There are ongoing costs and expenses for SEC reporting, including the general booking and accounting costs for the preparation of the financial quarterly (Form 10-Qs) and annual filings (Form 10-Ks), and auditors fees. Further, there are processing costs in preparing and converting documents and disclosures through the EDGAR filing system, including certain costs for the XBRL that are required as part of the EDGAR filing. We estimate that these costs could result in more than $80,000.00 per year of ongoing costs.\nWe may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations.\nOur implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules, including new accounting rules and interpretations, could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods.\nIf persons engage in short sales of our common stock, the price of our common stock may decline.\nSelling short is a technique used by a stockholder to take advantage of an anticipated decline in the price of a security. In addition, holders of options and warrants will sometimes sell short knowing they can, in effect, cover through the exercise of an option or warrant, thus locking in a profit. A significant number of short sales or a large volume of other sales within a relatively short period of time can create downward pressure on the market price of a security. Stockholders could, therefore, experience a decline in the value of their investment as a result of short sales of our common stock.\nThe Company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure.\nThe Company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the Company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The Company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident, series of events, or unforeseen liability for which the Company is self-insured, not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations or financial condition.\nIncreasing attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters may impact our business.\nIncreasing attention to ESG matters, including those related to climate change and sustainability, increasing societal, investor and legislative pressure on companies to address ESG matters, may result in increased costs, reduced revenues, increased investigations and litigation or threats thereof, negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets, and damage to our reputation. In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters, including climate change and climate-related risks. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings and investment community divestment initiatives, among other actions, may lead to negative investor sentiment toward the Company and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital. Additionally, evolving expectations on various ESG matters, including biodiversity, waste and water, may increase costs, require changes in how we operate and lead to negative stakeholder sentiment.\nClimate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse gas effects may adversely impact our operations.\nThere is a growing political and scientific consensus that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate. We may become subject to legislation and regulation regarding climate change, and compliance with any new rules could be difficult and costly. Concerned parties, such as legislators and regulators, stockholders and nongovernmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. Many states and countries have announced or adopted programs to stabilize and reduce GHG emissions and in the past federal legislation has been proposed in Congress. If such legislation is enacted, we could incur increased energy, environmental and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with the limitations. Unless and until legislation is enacted and its terms are known, we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate its impact on our financial condition, operating performance, or ability to compete. Climate change could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur principal executive office location and mailing address is 5051 Westheimer, Suite 1200, Houston, Texas, 77056. The square footage is approximately 300 square feet. The office is provided at no cost to us. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. We are not currently involved in any material pending legal proceeding or litigation, and, to the best of our knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which we are a party, and which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on our Company. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot Applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nOur Common shares were listed for quotation on the Pink Sheets of the OTC Markets under the symbol PNHT on March 7, 2016. On October 22, 2021 we were issued a new symbol PHCI.\nThere is an established current public market for the shares of our Common Stock which trade and are quoted bid/ask on the OTC Markets Pink Sheets. Other than the OTC Markets quotation, there can be no assurance that a liquid market for our securities will ever develop. Transfer of our Common Stock may also be restricted under the securities or blue-sky laws of various states and foreign jurisdictions. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investments and should be prepared to hold the common stock for an indefinite period of time.\nThe following table sets forth the range of high and low sales prices for our common stock for each of the periods indicated as reported by the OTC Markets Pink Sheets. These quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not necessarily represent actual transactions. Due to the fact that trading in our common stock is extremely sporadic, with multiple trading days where no trading occurs, and limited, with many trading days trading no shares of common stock, we believe the high and low sales prices below should not be relied upon as a basis for determining the value of our common stock.\n12 Month Period Ended July 31, 2023\nHigh\nLow\nQuarter ended July 31, 2023\n$ 4.50\n$ 1.05\nQuarter ended April 30, 2023\n$ 2.50\n$ .625\nQuarter ended January 31, 2023\n$ 4.00\n$ 1.25\nQuarter ended October 31, 2023\n$ 7.00\n$ 4.00\n12 Month Period Ended July 31, 2022\nHigh\nLow\nQuarter ended July 31, 2022\n$ 7.50\n$ 7.50\nQuarter ended April 30, 2022\n$ 10.00\n$ 5.00\nQuarter ended January 31, 2022\n$ 6.25\n$ 4.75\nQuarter ended October 31, 2022\n$ 4.75\n$ 2.00\nSecurities Transfer Corporation at 2901 Dallas Parkway, Suite 380 Plano, TX 75093 (Telephone 469-633-0101) is the registrar and transfer agent for our common shares.\nHolders\nOn November 14, 2023, the shareholders list showed 27 registered shareholders, not including any persons who hold their stock in street name, with 35,410,000 shares of common stock outstanding.\nDescription of Securities\nThe authorized capital stock of our Company consists of 550,000,000 shares of Common Stock, at $0.0001 par value, and 50,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, at $0.0001 par value. On October 21,2021 we amended our articles of incorporation to increase our authorized shares from 200,000,000 to 600,000,000 with 550,000,000 shares authorized of common stock.\nDividend Policy\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock and have no present intention of paying any dividends on the shares of our Common Stock. Our current policy is to retain earnings, if any, for use in our operations and in the development of our business. Our future dividend policy will be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors (the Board).\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nWe do not have any equity compensation plans.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nIn April 2023, the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement with an investor for the sale of 200,000 shares of restricted common stock at a price of $1.00 per share in cash.\nOn June 30, 2023, the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to two directors (Chris Barakat and Stanley F. Wilson, 1,000,000 shares each) for a price per share of $0.001 ($1,000) each. Due to the issuance of these shares to related parties at par value the company recognized stock-based compensation of $7,018,000, based on the closing share price of the company's common stock on the date of grant.\nThe issuances described above were exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2), and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act, since the foregoing issuances did not involve a public offering, the recipients took the securities for investment and not resale, we took take appropriate measures to restrict transfer, and the recipients were (a) accredited investors; and/or (b) had access to similar documentation and information as would be required in a Registration Statement under the Securities Act. The securities are subject to transfer restrictions, and the certificates/book-entry notations evidencing the securities contain an appropriate legend stating that such securities have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold absent registration or pursuant to an exemption therefrom.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nWe did not purchase any of our shares of common stock or other securities during our fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. ITEM 6. [RESERVED] ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\nPlan of Operations and Cash Requirements\nWe previously intended to offer management and consulting services to healthcare organizations. Because we have not been successful in launching our previous business plan, we are seeking new opportunities or business arrangements primarily in the environmental services industry, emerging innovative technologies and individual health choices led by innovation and integration.\nResults of Operations\nThe following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, which are included herein.\nOur operating results for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, and the changes between those periods for the respective items are summarized as follows:\nYear Ended\nJuly 31,\nChanges\nRevenues - related party\n$ 100,001\n$ 41,666\n$ 58,335\nCost of revenues- related party\n94,629\n38,214\n56,415\nOperating expenses\n7,126,053\n35,954\n7,090,099\nOther expenses\n3,977\n1,542\n2,435\nNet loss\n$ 7,124,658\n$ 34,044\n$ 7,090,614\nDuring the years ended July 31, 2023, and 2022, we generated $100,001 and $41,666 of revenues - related party, respectively. The revenues are related to the Consulting Agreement, discussed in greater detail above under Item 1. Business - Consulting Agreement. Of the amount for 2023, a total of $91,668 was paid in July 2022 through July 2023 and $8,333 was paid on August 1,2023. Revenues - related party increased in 2023, compared to 2022, due to five months of revenues in 2022 as the contract began in March 2022.\nWe had cost of revenues - related party of $94,629 and $38,214 for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which were in connection with salaries related to the First DP Ventures agreement. Cost of revenues - related party increased in 2023, compared to 2022, due to [five months of revenues in 2022 as the contract began in March of 2022.\nOperating expenses for the years ended July 31,2023 and 2022 were $7,126,053 and $35,954, respectively. For the year ended July 31,2023, the operating expenses were primarily attributed to professional fees for maintaining reporting status with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of $60,337, general and administrative expenses of $7,065,716 relating mainly to stock-based compensation.\nFor the year ended July 31, 2022, the operating expenses were primarily attributed to professional fees for maintaining reporting status with the SEC of $22,953 and general and administrative expenses of $13,001. Operating expenses increased for 2023 versus 2022, due to increased activities resulting in additional professional fees spent on legal and accounting.\nOther expenses for the years ended July 31, 2023, and 2022, represent interest expenses of $3,990 and $1,542 to our CEO and Chairman, T. Benjamin Jennings, on funds advanced to the Company and interest income of $13 and $0, respectively.\nWe had net losses of $7,124,658 for the year ended July 31, 2023, and $34,044 for the year ended July 31, 2022. The increase in net loss of $7,090,614 was due to an increase in operating expenses of $7,090,099 and other expenses of $2,435, offset by an increase in revenue of $58,335 and gross profit of $1,920, each as discussed above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBalance Sheet Data:\nJuly 31, 2023\nJuly 31, 2022\nChanges\nCash\n$ 118,569\n$ 3,087\n$ 115,482\nWorking capital deficiency\n$ 49,718\n$ (47,614 )\n$ 97,332\nTotal assets\n$ 129,602\n$ 12,572\n$ 117,030\nTotal liabilities\n$ 79,884\n$ 60,186\n$ 19,698\nTotal stockholders' equity (deficit)\n$ 49,718\n$ (47,614 )\n$ 97,332\nAs of July 31, 2023, our current assets were $129,602, and our current liabilities were $79,884 which resulted in working capital of $49,718. As of July 31, 2023, current assets were comprised of $118,569 in cash, $8,333 in accounts receivable and $2,700 in employee advanced. As of July 31, 2023, current liabilities were comprised of $32,385 in accounts payable and $47,499 in due to related party.\nAs of July 31, 2022, our current assets were $12,572, and our current liabilities were $60,186, which resulted in a working capital deficiency of $47,614. As of July 31, 2022, current assets were comprised of $3,087 in cash, $55 in prepaid expenses, $8,332 in accounts receivable and $1,098 in prepaid wages-related party.

Benjamin Jennings, and a stock subscription. For the years ended July 31, 2023, and 2022, we received $13,553 and $32,338 from advances to pay certain operating expenses from our CEO and Chairman, T. Benjamin Jennings and $200,000 and $0 common stock subscription from one investor, respectively.\nGoing Concern\nFor the year ended July 31, 2023, our company had a net loss of $7,124,658 and generated $100,001 in revenues. Our company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending July 31, 2024. The ability of our company to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of our business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our companys ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nWe do not currently have any additional commitments or identified sources of additional capital from third parties or from our officers, directors or majority stockholders. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nIn the future, we may seek additional capital by selling additional debt or equity securities. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if accomplished, may result in dilution to our then stockholders. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In the event we are unable to raise additional funding and/or obtain revenues sufficient to support our expenses, we may be forced to curtail or abandon our business operations, and any investment in the Company could become worthless.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from its contracts with customers in accordance with ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company recognizes revenues when satisfying the performance obligation of the associated contract that reflects the consideration expected to be received based on the terms of the contract.\nRevenue related to contracts with customers is evaluated utilizing the following steps:\n(i)\nIdentify the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n(ii)\nIdentify the performance obligations in the contract;\n(iii)\nDetermine the transaction price;\n(iv)\nAllocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n(v)\nRecognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nWhen the Company enters into a contract, the Company analyses the services required in the contract in order to identify the required performance obligations which would indicate the Company has met and fulfilled its obligations. For the current contracts in place, the Company has identified performance obligations as one single event, the sign-off by both parties that current objectives have been achieved. To appropriately identify the performance obligations, the Company considers all of the services required to be satisfied per the contract, whether explicitly stated or implicitly implied. The Company allocates the full transaction price to the single performance obligation being satisfied.\nThe Company recognizes the monthly revenue at the beginning of the month and any cash payments received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue until all obligations have been met as specified in the related customer contract.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company entered in a Consulting Agreement in the field of healthcare for monthly $8,333 with First DP Ventures, LP. The services were performed by a member of the Companys board of directors. As of July 31, 2023, and 2022, all revenue of $100,001 and $41,666 and accounts receivable of $8,333 and $8,332, respectively, related to First DP Ventures, LP.\nCost of revenue\nDuring the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, cost of revenue of $94,629 and $38,214 was for the payroll expenses related to Chris Barakat, a member of the Companys board of directors, who performed services in connection with the Consulting Agreement.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nFor more information on recently issued accounting standards, see Note 2 - Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein under Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplemental Data. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. ITEM 8.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\nPursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Companys management, including our Companys Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) (our principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of our Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Companys CEO and CFO concluded that our Companys disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our Company in the reports that our Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our Companys management, including our Companys CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, due to the material weaknesses identified below.\nIt should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nReport of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of our Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our Company. Our internal control system was designed, in general, to provide reasonable assurance to our companys management and board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements, but because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.\nIn the course of managements assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of July 31,2023. We have identified the following material weakness in internal control over financial reporting:\n\u00b7\nThe Company has no formal control process related to the identification and approval of related party transactions.\n\u00b7\nSegregation of Duties - As a result of limited resources, we did not maintain proper segregation of incompatible duties, namely the lack of an audit committee, an understaffed financial and accounting function, and the need for additional personnel to prepare and analyze financial information in a timely manner and to allow review and on-going monitoring and enhancement of our controls. The effect of the lack of segregation of duties potentially affects multiple processes and procedures\nWe are in the continuous process of improving our internal control over financial reporting in an effort to eliminate the material weakness through improved supervision and training of our staff, but additional effort is needed to fully remedy these deficiencies. Management has engaged a Certified Public Accountant as a consultant to assist with the financial reporting process in an effort to mitigate the identified weakness. Our Company is still in its development stage and intends on hiring the necessary staff to address the weaknesses once revenue has been realized.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our Companys registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our Companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit our Company to provide only managements report in this annual report.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nExcept as discussed above, there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2023, that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nThe information and disclosures which are set forth above under Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, under the heading Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities, are incorporated by reference into this Item 5. Other Information, in their entirety, and shall serve as disclosure of such information pursuant to Item 3.02 of Form 8-K.\nITEM 9C.

Benjamin Jennings - Chairman, CEO, President, Director\nMr. Jennings is a proven leader in environmental services, FMCG, real estate, innovative technology for healthcare systems, and investment banking.

All proceedings of the Board of Directors were conducted by resolutions consented to in writing by all the directors and filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the directors. Such resolutions consented to in writing by the directors entitled to vote on that resolution at a meeting of the directors are, according to the Nevada General Corporate Law and our Bylaws, as valid and effective as if they had been passed at a meeting of the directors duly called and held.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nOur Board of Directors has the responsibility for selecting the appropriate leadership structure for the Company. In making leadership structure determinations, the Board of Directors considers many factors, including the specific needs of the business and what is in the best interests of the Companys stockholders. Our current leadership structure is comprised of a combined Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mr. T. Benjamin Jennings. The Board of Directors believes that this leadership structure is the most effective and efficient for the Company at this time. Mr. T. Benjamin Jennings possesses detailed and in-depth knowledge of the issues, opportunities, and challenges facing the Company, and is thus best positioned to develop agendas that ensure that the Board of Directors time and attention are focused on the most critical matters. Combining the Chairman of the Board and CEO roles promotes decisive leadership, fosters clear accountability and enhances the Companys ability to communicate its message and strategy clearly and consistently to our stockholders, particularly during periods of turbulent economic and industry conditions.\nRisk Oversight\nEffective risk oversight is an important priority of the Board of Directors. Because risks are considered in virtually every business decision, the Board of Directors discusses risk throughout the year generally or in connection with specific proposed actions. The Board of Directors approach to risk oversight includes understanding the critical risks in the Companys business and strategy, evaluating the Companys risk management processes, allocating responsibilities for risk oversight, and fostering an appropriate culture of integrity and compliance with legal responsibilities. The directors exercise direct oversight of strategic risks to the Company.\nNomination Process\nAs of July 31, 2023, we did not affect any material changes to the procedures by which our shareholders may recommend nominees to our Board of Directors. Our Board does not have a policy with regards to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by our shareholders. Our Board of Directors has determined that it is in the best position to evaluate our Companys requirements, as well as the qualifications of each candidate, when the Board considers a nominee for a position on our Board of Directors. If shareholders wish to recommend candidates directly to our board, they may do so by sending communications to the President of our company at the address on the cover of this Annual Report.\nAudit Committee\nWe do not have a standing audit committee as we currently have limited working capital and minimal revenues. Should we be able to raise sufficient funding to execute our business plan, we will form audit, compensation and other applicable committees utilizing our directors expertise.\nPolicy on Equity Ownership\nThe Company does not have a policy on equity ownership at this time.\nInsider Trading/Policy Against Hedging\nThe Company recognizes that hedging against losses in Company shares may disturb the alignment between stockholders and executives that equity awards are intended to build; however, while \u2018short sales are discouraged by the Company, the Company does not currently have a policy prohibiting such transactions or any formal insider trading policy.\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank)\nDodd-Frank requires public companies to provide shareholders with an advisory vote on compensation of the most highly compensated executives, which are sometimes referred to as say on pay, as well as an advisory vote on how often the company will present say on pay votes to its shareholders. The Company plans to provide its shareholders the right to vote on say-on-pay matters beginning at the next annual meeting of stockholders which the Company holds after this filing.\nCompensation Recovery and Clawback Policies\nUnder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), in the event of misconduct that results in a financial restatement that would have reduced a previously paid incentive amount, we can recoup those improper payments from our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (if any). The SEC also recently adopted rules which direct national stock exchanges to require listed companies to implement policies intended to recoup bonuses paid to executives if the company is found to have misstated its financial results. We plan to implement a clawback policy in the future, if required, although we have not yet implemented such policy.\nShareholder Communications\nOur stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with members of the board of directors by submitting such communications in writing to our Corporate Secretary, 1218 Webster Street, Houston, Texas 77002 who, upon receipt of any communication other than one that is clearly marked Confidential, will note the date the communication was received, open the communication, make a copy of it for our files and promptly forward the communication to the director(s) to whom it is addressed. Upon receipt of any communication that is clearly marked Confidential, our Corporate Secretary will not open the communication, but will note the date the communication was received and promptly forward the communication to the director(s) to whom it is addressed. If the correspondence is not addressed to any particular board member or members, the communication will be forwarded to a board member to bring to the attention of the board of directors.\nDelinquent Section 16(a) Reports\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC initial statements of beneficial ownership, reports of changes in ownership and annual reports concerning their ownership in our common stock and other equity securities, on Form 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by the SEC regulations to furnish our company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file.\nBased solely on our review of the copies of such reports received by us, we believe that all filings required to be made under Section 16(a) during 2023 were timely made, except that Christopher Barakat, our director, failed to timely file on Form 4, and as a result, one transaction was not timely disclosed; Stanley Wilson, our director, failed to timely file on Form 4, and as a result, one transaction was not timely disclosed; Curtis Summers, our director, failed to timely file on Form 4, and as a result, one transaction was not timely disclosed; and Douglas G.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended July 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company suffered a net loss from operations and used cash in operations, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans regarding those matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs discussed in Note 2, the Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.\nAuditing managements evaluation of agreements with customers involves significant judgment, given the fact that some agreements require managements evaluation and allocation of the standalone transaction prices to the performance obligations.\nTo evaluate the appropriateness and accuracy of the assessment by management, we evaluated managements assessment in relationship to the relevant agreements.\n/s/ M&K CPAS, PLLC\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2021.\nThe Woodlands, TX\nNovember 16, 2023\nPANAMERA HOLDINGS CORPORATION\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nJuly 31,\nJuly 31,\nAssets\nCurrent Assets\nCash\n$ 118,569\n$ 3,087\nPrepaid expenses\n-\nAccounts receivable\n8,333\n8,332\nOther receivable -related party\n-\n1,098\nEmployee advanced\n2,700\n-\nTotal Current Assets\n129,602\n12,572\nTotal Assets\n$ 129,602\n$ 12,572\nLiabilities and Stockholders' Equity (Deficit)\nCurrent Liabilities\nAccounts payable\n$ 32,385\n$ 17,034\nPayroll liabilities - related party\n-\n7,706\nDeferred revenue and customer deposits\n-\n1,500\nDue to related party\n47,499\n33,946\nTotal Current Liabilities\n79,884\n60,186\nTotal Liabilities\n79,884\n60,186\nStockholders' Equity (Deficit)\nPreferred stock: 50,000,000 authorized;

It is based in Houston, TX. Effective October 21, 2021, the Company changed its name from Panamera Healthcare Corporation to Panamera Holdings Corporation and increased the number of authorized shares of common stock from 150,000,000 shares of common stock to 550,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share. The Companys fiscal year end is July 31.\nThe Company intended to offer management and consulting services to healthcare organizations but has redirected its efforts to now pursuing business opportunities, including but not limited to the environmental services industry, emerging innovative technologies and individual health choices led by innovation with integration. To date, the Companys activities have been limited to its formation and the raising of equity capital and consulting services related to an agreement effective on March 1, 2022, with First DP Ventures, LP dba First Primary Care of Houston, Texas.\nOn June 2, 2023, The Companys Board of Directors approved the creation of three wholly-owned subsidiaries, named Panamera Metals Corporation, Panamera Technologies Corporation and Panamera Waste Corporation. On July 20, 2023, the three wholly-owned subsidiaries were registered in the State of Texas.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of July 31, 2023, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, has an accumulated deficit of $7,522,698 and earned limited revenues of $100,001 during the year ended July 31, 2023. The Company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements and related party advances, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending July 31, 2024.\nThe ability of the Company to emerge from an early stage is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of its business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings.\nThese factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of the United States.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Panamera Holdings Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Panamera Metals Corporation, Panamera Technologies Corporation and Panamera Waste Corporation, collectively referred to as the Company. All inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivables are recorded in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 310, Receivables. Accounts receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount or agreement and do not bear interest. The Company does not currently have any amount recorded as an allowance for doubtful accounts. Based on the managements estimate and based on all accounts being current, the Company has not deemed it necessary to reserve for doubtful accounts at this time.\nNet Loss Per Share of Common Stock\nThe Company has adopted ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, (EPS) which requires presentation of basic EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation. In the accompanying consolidated financial statements, basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.\nThe Company has no potentially dilutive securities, such as options or warrants, currently issued and outstanding.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nThe Companys consolidated financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and cash equivalents and related party payables that it will likely incur in the near future. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. At times, its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The Companys management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds, and as such, it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited.\nFinancial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.\nFair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of July 31, 2023 and 2022. The carrying values of our financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and loans payable from related party approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company has implemented all new pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or results of operations.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company follows ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies, to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from its contracts with customers in accordance with ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company recognizes revenues when satisfying the performance obligation of the associated contract that reflects the consideration expected to be received based on the terms of the contract.\nRevenue related to contracts with customers is evaluated utilizing the following steps:\n(i)\nIdentify the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n(ii)\nIdentify the performance obligations in the contract;\n(iii)\nDetermine the transaction price;\n(iv)\nAllocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract;\n(v)\nRecognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nThe Company has one annual consulting contract that requires a fixed monthly payment of $8,333. The Company recognizes the monthly revenue at the beginning of the month and any cash payments received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue until all obligations have been met as specified in the related customer contract.\nAs at July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded a customer deposit of $0 and $1,500 for an advance on revenue, respectively.\nShare-Based Compensation\nASC 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options, and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).\nThe Company has adopted the guidance included under ASU 2018-07, stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants. Equity-based payments to non-employees are measured at grant-date fair value of the equity instruments that the Company is obligated to issue when the service has been rendered and any other conditions necessary to earn the right to benefit from the instruments have been satisfied. Equity-classified non-employee share-based payment awards are measured at the grant date.\nNOTE 3 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n-\nDuring the years ended year ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, related parties financed $13,553 and $32,338 for operation expenses, respectively.\nAs of July 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company was obliged for an unsecured, none-interest bearing demand loans to three related parties, with balances of $47,499 and $33,946, respectively.\n-\nDuring the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $3,990 and $1,542 interest on related party loans and imputed in additional paid-in-capital, respectively.\n-\nDuring the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized and paid $86,000 and $35,000 of salary to a member of the board of directors for services rendered to the Company. As at July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized prepaid wages of $0 and $1,098 for over payment of salary, respectively.\n-\nDuring the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company paid $2,800 and $0 salary to the Companys corporate secretary - related party.\n-\nOn March 1, 2022, the Company entered in a consulting agreement in the field of Healthcare with a monthly payment of $8,333, with First DP Ventures, LP. The services were performed by a member of the Companys board of directors. During the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company generated revenues of $100,001 and $41,666 and recognized and paid $86,000 and $35,000 salary to a member of the board of directors, respectively.\n-\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of common stock to two directors for $2,000. As of July 31, 2023, the Company recorded a common stock subscriptions receivable - related parties of $2,000. The payments were collected prior to the issuance of this annual report. This issuance resulted in stock-based compensation of $7,018,000.\n-\nThe Company does not own or lease property or lease office space. The office space used by the Company was arranged by the founder, who is also a director of the Company, to use at no charge.\n-\nAs discussed in Note 5, related parties surrendered common stock to the Company.\nNOTE 4 - PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\nThe Company provides for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes.
