A change of control of the Company was completed on January 19, 2017 from Jay Hooper, the former officer and director of the Company and its former majority shareholder.

In connection with the change of control, the Company sold to its former majority shareholder a subsidiary for $100 and another subsidiary in exchange for the cancellation of all payables and accrued expenses.

The rule defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. The rule provides that any equity security is considered to be a penny stock unless that security is:\n-\nregistered and traded on a national securities exchange meeting specified criteria set by the SEC;\n-\nissued by a registered investment company;\n-\nexcluded from the definition on the basis of price (at least $5.00 per share) or the issuers net tangible assets.\nTrading in the penny stocks is subject to additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Accredited investors, in general, include certain institutional investors and individuals with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together with their spouse.\nFor transactions covered by these rules, broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of our securities and must have received the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the first transaction, of a risk disclosure document relating to the penny stock. A broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, and current quotations for the security. Finally, monthly statements must be sent to the purchaser disclosing recent price information for the penny stocks. Consequently, these rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to trade or maintain a market in our common stock and may affect the ability of shareholders to sell their shares.\nHolders\nAs of June 30, 2023, there were approximately 917 shareholders of record holding 21,107,018,148 shares of common stock.

The factors listed in the section captioned Risk Factors, as well as any cautionary language in this report; provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected. Except as may be required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events after the date of this Form 10-K.\nOverview of Business\nOur mission is to invest in innovative technologies, integrated with business development in the healthcare ecosystem.\nWe are focused on protein and peptide small molecular drugs research and development, diagnostic and medical devices with AI cloud computing, cell therapy and regenerational medicine and supplements manufacturing and sales.\nOn September 3, 2021, the Company entered into an Assets Acquisition Agreement with Wangs Property Investment & Management LLC to purchase 53 units in 19 real estate properties appraised at $7,626, 286.37 for a purchase price of $7,000,000, The purchase price shall be paid as follows: (i) $1,000,000 on execution of the Agreement, (ii) $2,000,000 within 60 days thereof and (iii) the remainder by April 10, 2022. The Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including, satisfactory due diligence. On September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a Supplemental Assets Acquisition Agreement with Wangs Property Investment & Management LLC to amend and clarify that (i) it was purchasing 19 real estate properties which includes 53 units appraised at $7,626,286.37 for a purchase price of $7,000,000 and (ii) that it will waive and not conduct due diligence in order for the transaction to proceed. The acquisition has not been consummated. With the asset acquisition from Wangs Property Investment & Management LLC, the Company will diversify its business into property investment and management. By the end of May 2022, the Company ceased the acquisition of Wangs Property Investment & Management LLC.\nResults of Operations\nResults of Operations for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to the year ended June 30, 2022.\nSales amounted to $204,309 and $104,648 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCost of goods sold amounted to $35,720 and $1,588,453 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nGross profit/(loss) amounted to $168,588 and ($1,483,805) for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOperating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were $661,232 and $3,250,293, respectively. The decrease was mainly due to reduced payroll expenses, rent expenses, advertising, and professional expenses.\nOur net loss for the year ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was $777,341 and $4,924,936, respectively. The decrease in net loss was mainly due to the decreased cost of goods sold and operating expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures.\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements (CFS) were prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying CFS, the Company has incurred recurring net losses. For the year ended June 30, 2023 the Company recorded a net loss of $777,341, used cash to fund operating activities of $752,902 and at June 30, 2023, had a shareholders deficit of $4,525,835. For the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded a net loss of $4,924,936, used cash to fund operating activities of $1,479,859, and on June 30, 2022, had a shareholders deficit of $3,860,481. These factors create substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company is raising the additional capital to achieve profitable operations.\nOur cash needs for the year ended June 30, 2023 were primarily met by loans and advances from our current majority shareholder. As of June 30, 2023, we had a cash balance of $54,150. Our future majority shareholders will need to provide all of our working capitals going forward.\nPrimarily as a result of our recurring losses and our lack of liquidity, we received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm for our financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2023 that includes an explanatory paragraph describing the uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFinancial Position\nAs of June 30, 2023, we had $54,150 in cash, a working capital deficit of $2,912,469 and an accumulated deficit of $9,183,110.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nEstimates\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements (CFS) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The more significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others, the fair value of shares of common stock issued for services. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions.\nRevenues\nRevenue from sale of goods under Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, is recognized in a manner that reasonably reflects the delivery of the Companys products and services to customers in return for expected consideration and includes the following elements:\n\u25cf\nexecuted contract(s) with customers that the Company believes is legally enforceable;\n\u25cf\nidentification of performance obligation in the respective contract;\n\u25cf\ndetermination of the transaction price for each performance obligation in the respective contract;\n\u25cf\nallocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation; and\n\u25cf\nrecognition of revenue only when the Company satisfies each performance obligation.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence, or impaired balances.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value measurements are determined using authoritative guidance issued by the FASB, with the exception of the application of the guidance to non-recurring, non-financial assets and liabilities as permitted. Fair value is defined in the authoritative guidance as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy was established, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows:\nLevel 1-Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2-Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, are observable either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3-Unobservable inputs based on the Companys assumptions.\nThe Company is required to use observable market data if available without undue cost and effort.\nThe Companys financial instruments include cash and accounts payable. Management has estimated that the carrying amounts approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature.\nLoss Per Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. The Companys diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, as there are no potential shares outstanding that would have a dilutive effect.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. The Company recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company classifies the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the Company anticipates payment (or receipt) of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for income taxes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Footnote 2 of the financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any contractual obligations or off-balance sheet arrangements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nOur financial statements appear beginning on page in this Form 10-K. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures performed by our Chief Executive Officer as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures have not been effective as a result of a weakness in the design of internal control over financial reporting identified below.\nAs used herein, disclosure controls and procedures mean controls and other procedures of our company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commissions rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (ICFR), as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Accounting Officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our ICFR based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013). Based on managements evaluation under the framework, management has concluded that our ICFR was not effective as of June 30, 2023.\nWe identified material weaknesses in our ICFR primarily attributable to (i) lack of segregation of incompatible duties; and (ii) insufficient Board of Directors representation. These weaknesses are due to our inadequate staffing during the period covered by this report and our lack of working capital to hire additional staff. Management has retained an outside, independent financial consultant to record and review all financial data, as well as prepare our financial reports, in order to mitigate this weakness. Although management will periodically re-evaluate this situation, at this point it considers that the risk associated with such lack of segregation of duties and the potential benefits of adding employees to segregate such duties are not cost justified. We intend to hire additional accounting personnel to assist with financial reporting as soon as our finances will allow.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding ICFR. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only managements report in this annual report.

The Company intends to adopt a code of ethics in the near future.\nAudit Committee Financial Expert\nThe Company does not have either an Audit Committee or a financial expert on the BOD. The BOD believes that obtaining the services of an audit committee financial expert is not economically rational at this time in light of the costs associated with identifying and retaining an individual who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert, the limited scope of our operations and the relative simplicity of our financial statements and accounting procedures.\nSection 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC initial statements of beneficial ownership, reports of changes in ownership and annual reports concerning their ownership of our common stock and other equity securities, on Form 3, 4 and 5 respectively.

This significant responsibility requires highly skilled individuals with various qualities, attributes and professional experience. Our BOD believes that there are general requirements for service on the BOD that are applicable to directors and that there are other skills and experience that should be represented on the BOD as a whole but not necessarily by each director. The BOD considers the qualifications of director and director candidates individually and in the broader context of the BODs overall composition and the Companys current and future needs.\nQualifications, Attributes, Skills and Experience to be Represented on the Board as a Whole\nThe BOD has identified particular qualifications, attributes, skills and experience that are important to be represented on the board as a whole, in light of the Companys current needs and its business priorities. The BOD believes that it should include some directors with a high level of financial literacy and some directors who possess relevant business experience as a Chief Executive Officer or a President or like position. Marketing is the core focus of our business, and the Company seeks to develop and deploy the worlds most innovative and effective marketing and technology. Therefore, the Board believes that marketing and technology experience should be represented on the BOD. Since the Company is involved in the healthcare business, the Companys business also requires compliance with a variety of regulatory requirements and relationships with various governmental entities. Therefore, the BOD believes that governmental, political, or diplomatic expertise should be represented on the Board.\nSet forth below are a chart and a narrative disclosure that summarize the specific qualifications, attributes, skills and experiences described above. An X in the chart below indicates that the item is a specific reason that the director has been nominated to serve on the Companys Board. The lack of an X for a particular qualification does not mean that the director does not possess that qualification or skill. Rather, an X indicates a specific area of focus or expertise of a director on which the BOD currently relies.\nHigh level of financial literacy\nMike Q. Wang\nQuinn Chen\nX\nExtensive knowledge of the Companys business\nX\nX\nMarketing/Marketing related technology experience\nX\nRelevant Chief Executive/President or like experience\nX\nX\nCorporate Governance expertise\nX\nX\nDirectors or Executive Officers involved in Bankruptcy or Criminal Proceedings\nTo our knowledge, during the last ten years, none of our directors and executive officers (including those of our subsidiaries), has:\n\u25cf\nHad a bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time.\n\u25cf\nBeen convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding, excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses.\n\u25cf\nBeen subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities.\n\u25cf\nBeen found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the SEC, or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended or vacated.\n\u25cf\nBeen the subject to, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization, any registered entity, or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.\nBoard Meetings\nThe BOD held no meetings during FY 2023.\nMaterial Changes to the Procedures by which Security Holders May Recommend Nominees to the Board of Directors\nThere have been no material changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to the BOD.\nBoard Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight\nMr. Mike Q. Wang is our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer. As a main officer and director, Mr. Wang, by default, serves as our business and industry leader most capable of identifying strategic priorities and executing our business strategy. In addition, having a single leader eliminates the potential for confusion and provides clear leadership for the Company. We believe that this leadership structure has served the Company well. The Boards role in the risk oversight of the Company includes, among other things:\n\u25cf\nappointing, retaining and overseeing the work of the independent auditors, including resolving disagreements between the management and the independent auditors relating to financial reporting;\n\u25cf\napproving all auditing and non-auditing services permitted to be performed by the independent auditors;\n\u25cf\nreviewing annually the independence and quality control procedures of the independent auditors;\n\u25cf\nreviewing and approving all proposed related party transactions;\n\u25cf\ndiscussing the annual audited financial statements with the management; and\n\u25cf\nmeeting separately with the independent auditors to discuss critical accounting policies, management letters, recommendations on internal controls, the auditors engagement letter and independence letter and other material written communications between the independent auditors and the management.\nOur BOD is responsible for approving all related party transactions. We have not adopted written policies and procedures specifically for related person transactions. ITEM 12.

As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company owed its current majority shareholder and other related $425,142 and $573,859 respectively. The advances are non-interest bearing and are due on demand.\nDirector Independence\nCurrently, the Company does not have any independent directors. Since the Companys common stock is not currently listed on a national securities exchange, we have used the definition of independence of The NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination.\nUnder NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2), an \"independent director\" is a \"person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the company's board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.\"\nWe do not currently have a separately designated audit, nominating or compensation committee. However, we do intend to comply with the independent director and committee composition requirements in the future. ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES\nThe following table sets forth the fees paid by the Company for professional services rendered for the audits of the annual financial statements and fees billed for other services rendered by its prior principal accountant, WWC, P.C. and by its current principal accountant, Gries & Associates LLC:\nType of Services Rendered\nAudit Fees\n$ 36,500\n$ 120,158\nAudit-Related Fees\n$ -\n$ -\nTax Fees\n$ -\n$ -\nAll Other Fees\n$ -\n$ -\nPre-approval Policies\nWe do not have a standing audit committee currently serving and as a result our BOD performs the duties of an audit committee. Our BOD evaluates and approves, in advance, the scope and cost of the engagement of an accounting firm before the accounting firm renders audit and non-audit services. We do not rely on pre-approval policies and procedures.\nPART IV ITEM 15.

Cherry Street, Suite 1100\nDenver, Colorado 80246\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\nAmerican Great Health and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheet of American Great Health and Subsidiaries. (the Company) as of June 30, 2023, and the related statement of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows for the period then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the period then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nGoing Concern Uncertainty\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred losses since inception of $9,183,110 and a net loss of $777,341. These factors create an uncertainty as to the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nEmphasis of Matters-Risks and Uncertainties\nThe Company is not able to predict the ultimate impact that COVID -19 will have on its business. However, if the current economic conditions continue, the pandemic could have an adverse impact on the economies and financial markets of many countries, including the geographical area in which the Company plans to operate.\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2023.\nblaze@griesandassociates.com\n400 South Colorado Blvd, Suite 870, Denver, Colorado 80246\n(O)720-464-2875 (M)773-255-5631 (F)720-222-5846\nDenver, Colorado\nOctober 12, 2023\nPCAOB ID: 6778\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\nAmerica Great Health and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of America Great Health and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2021, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' deficit, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGoing Concern Matter\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement, whether due to error fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\nOur audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial\nInvestment in Purecell Group (Purecell)\nAs described in Note 1,8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company issued 545,000,000 shares to acquire 51% of Purecells equity interest. Management reviews its equity investment in Purecell and accounted for under the equity methods because the Company does not have significant control over Purecell. The Company hired an external valuation firm to perform 409A valuation as of the acquisition date to determine the fair value of the Companys common share. The share was valued at $0.00001 per share.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value of the investment in Purecell is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included(i) evaluating the appropriateness of comparable market value and (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of cost to recreate a similar company.\n/s/ TAAD, LLP\nWe have served as

As reflected in the accompanying CFS, the Company has incurred recurring net losses. For the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded a net loss of $777,340, used cash to fund operating activities of $752,902, and on June 30, 2023, had a shareholders deficit of $4,525,836. These factors create substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2017, the Companys former majority shareholder sold his shares to an investor group. The new owners plans to continue as a going concern revolve around its ability to achieve profitable operations, as well as raise necessary capital to pay ongoing general and administrative expenses of the Company. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on securing additional sources of capital and the success of the Companys plan. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising the additional capital or in achieving profitable operations.\nOur cash needs for the 12 months ended June 30, 2023 were primarily met by loans and advances from the current majority shareholder. As of June 30, 2023, we had a cash balance of $54,150. We intend to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and advance from the current majority shareholder.\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying CFS were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP).\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements includes the accounts of the Company and its current wholly owned subsidiaries, America Great Health in California (100%), GOF Biotechnologies in California (75%), International Institute of Great Health in California (100%), Nutrature Health LLC in California (100%), Sijinsai in China (60%), and US-China Mega Beauty Health Industry Development Co., LTD, (100%). Intercompany transactions and accounts were eliminated in consolidation.\nThe following table depicts the identity of the Companys subsidiaries:\nAttributable\nPlace of\nEquity\nName of Subsidiary\nIncorporation\nInterest %\nAmerica Great Health in California\nUSA\nGOF Biotechnologies in California\nUSA\nInternational Institute of Great Health in California\nUSA\nNutrature Health LLC in California\nUSA\nSijinsai in China\nCHINA\nUS-China Mega Beauty Health Industry Development Co., LTD\nCHINA\nEstimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include accounting for potential liabilities and the assumptions made in valuing stock instruments issued for services, debt and equity investment. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nForeign Currency Translation\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations.\nIn accordance with ASC 830, Translation of Financial Statements the subsidiarys assets and liabilities booked and recorded at the non-US local functional currency are generally translated into USD for consolidation purposes, using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of foreign subsidiarys financial statements are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders equity.\nThe Companys reporting currency is the United States Dollar (USD). The Companys wholly owned subsidiary of Meizhong Health Industry Development Co., Ltd. maintains its books and records in its local currency. The Chinese Yuan (RMB), which is the functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the subsidiary operates.\nBelow is a table with foreign exchange rates used for translation:\nJune 30,\nAverage Yearly (average rate)\nChinese Renminbi (RMB)\nRMB 6.9632\nUnited States dollar ($)\n$ 1.00\nJune 30,\nYear Ended (Closing rate)\nChinese Renminbi (RMB)\nRMB 7.2537\nUnited States dollar ($)\n$ 1.00\nCash\nThe Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with maturity periods of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amounts reported in the accompanying balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair value. The Companys bank account in the United States is protected by FDIC insurance.\nThe Companys bank account in the United States is protected by FDIC insurance. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Companys bank account in the United States had $4,131 and $3,194, respectively, under FDIC insurance of $250,000.\nRevenues\nRevenue from sale of goods under Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, is recognized in a manner that reasonably reflects the delivery of the Companys products and services to customers in return for expected consideration and includes the following elements:\n\u25cf\nexecuted contract(s) with customers that the Company believes is legally enforceable;\n\u25cf\nidentification of performance obligation in the respective contract;\n\u25cf\ndetermination of the transaction price for each performance obligation in the respective contract;\n\u25cf\nallocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation; and\n\u25cf\nrecognition of revenue only when the Company satisfies each performance obligation.\nThe Company sells health-related products through wholesale and retailers. The Company considers purchase orders to be a contract with a customer. Contracts with customers are considered to be short-term when the time between order confirmation and satisfaction of the performance obligations is equal to or less than one year, and virtually all of the Companys contracts are short-term. The Company recognizes revenue for the transfer of promised goods to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods. The Company typically satisfies its performance obligations in contracts with customers upon shipment of the goods. The Company usually does not have any contract assets since the Company has an unconditional right to consideration when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation and payment from customers is not contingent on a future event. Generally, payment is due from customers within 40 to 60 days of the invoice date and 180 days for a major customer, and the contracts do not have significant financing components nor variable consideration. Returns and allowances are not a significant aspect of the revenue recognition process as historically they have been immaterial. All of the Companys contracts have a single performance obligation satisfied at a point in time and the transaction price is stated in the contract, usually as a price per unit. All estimates are based on the Companys historical experience; complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, and the Companys best judgment at the time the estimate is made. Historically, sales returns have not significantly impacted on the Companys revenue.\nProduct Revenue\nA majority of the Companys sales are for products sold at a point in time when shipped to customers, for which control is transferred to the customer as goods are delivered to the third-party carrier for shipment. The Company receives payment for the sale of products at the time customers place orders and payment is required prior to shipment. Any payment received prior to shipment is recognized as a contract liability under the account deferred revenue. The Company does not recognize assets associated with costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer.\nShipping and handling activities are performed by third-party carriers for shipment. The Company accounts for these activities as fulfillment costs. Therefore, the Company recognizes the costs of these activities when revenue for the goods is recognized. Shipping and handling costs are included in the cost of sales for all periods presented.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence, or impaired balances. For the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company has non-written-off.\nEquity Method Investments\nWe apply the equity method of accounting to investments when we have significant influence, but not controlling interest in the investee. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions. The Companys proportionate share of the net income (loss) resulting from these investments is reported under the line item captioned equity investment in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The carrying value of our equity method investments is reported in equity investment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Companys equity method investments are reported at cost and adjusted each period for the Companys share of the investees income or loss and dividend paid, if any. The Companys share of the investees income or loss is recorded on a one quarter lag for all equity method investments. The Company classifies distributions received from equity method investments using the cumulative earnings approach on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. The Company recorded no other-than-temporary impairment charges related to its equity method investments during the year ended June 30, 2023.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value measurements are determined using authoritative guidance issued by the FASB, with the exception of the application of the guidance to non-recurring, non-financial assets and liabilities as permitted. Fair value is defined in the authoritative guidance as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy was established, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows:\nLevel 1-Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2-Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, are observable either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3-Unobservable inputs based on the Companys assumptions.\nThe Company is required to use observable market data if available without undue cost and effort.\nThe Companys financial instruments include cash and accounts payable. Management has estimated that the carrying amounts approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature.\nLoss Per Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing the income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. The Companys diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, as there are no potential shares outstanding that would have a diluted effect.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expenses are based on pretax financial accounting income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. The Company did not record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company classifies the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the Company anticipates payment (or receipt) of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for income taxes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn July 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features, (Part II), which is the replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatory Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatory Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests with a Scope Exception. The amendments in Part I of this Update that relate to the recognition, measurement, and earnings per share of certain freestanding equity-classified financial instruments that include down round features affect entities that present earnings per share in accordance with the guidance in Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. The amendments in Part II of this Update do not have an accounting effect. The amendments in Part I of the update are effective for fiscal year, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is assessing the impact to its accounting practices and financial reporting procedures as a result of the issuance of this standard.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. The amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods therein. Early adoption of the standard is permitted, including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nOther recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or is not believed by management to have a material impact on the Companys present or future consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 3 - OTHER ASSET\nAs of June 30, 2023 and 2022, other receivable amounted to $11,836 and $13,836, respectively.

Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established for the full amount of the net deferred tax asset.\nUnder the Provisional Regulations of The Peoples Republic of China Concerning Income Tax on Enterprises promulgated by the PRC, which took effect on January 1, 2008, domestic and foreign companies pay a unified corporate income tax of 25%, except for a 15% corporate income tax rate for qualified high technology and science enterprises.\nThe Companys effective income tax rate differs from the amount computed by applying the federal statutory income tax rate to loss before income taxes for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 as follows:\nYear Ended June 30,\nIncome tax benefit at federal statutory rate-US\n%\n%\nState tax, net of fed effect-US\n%\n%\nChange in valuation allowance-US\n(28 )%\n(28 )%\nIncome tax benefit at federal statutory rate-PRC\n%\n%\nChange in valuation allowance-PRC\n(25 )%\n(25 )%\nThe components of deferred taxes consist of the following at June 30, 2022 and 2021:\nJune 30, 2023\nJune 30, 2022\nNet operating loss carryforwards\n$ 6,697,872\n$ 5,920,531\nLess: valuation allowance\n(6,697,872 )\n(5,920,531 )\nNet deferred tax assets\n$ -\n$ -\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company had federal and California income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $6,697,872. These net operating losses originating in tax years beginning prior to Jan. 1, 2018, will begin to expire 20 years from the date the tax returns are filed.

For the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company recognized approximately $36,556 in total lease costs.\nBecause the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments.\nInformation related to the Companys operating ROU assets and related lease liabilities are as follows:\nYear Ended\nJune 30, 2023\nCash paid for operating lease liabilities\n$ 75,706\nWeighted-average remaining lease term\n0.64\nWeighted-average discount rate\n%\nMinimum future lease payments\n$ 42,191\nThe following table presents the amortization of the Companys lease liabilities under ASC 842 for each of the following years ending June 30:\n$ 36,899\n3,528\n1,764\n-\nTotal minimum payments\n42,191\nLess: imputed interest\n(273 )\nTotal lease liability\n41,918\nLess: short-term lease liability\n(41,918 )\nLong-term lease liability\n$ -\nNOTE 12 - CONCENTRATION\nMajor vendors\nFor the year ended June 30, 2023, no vendors accounted for 10% or more of the Companys purchases and its outstanding accounts payable balances as at year-end dates.\nNOTE 13 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn July 23, 2023, the Company, SHOWA International Pty Ltd.
