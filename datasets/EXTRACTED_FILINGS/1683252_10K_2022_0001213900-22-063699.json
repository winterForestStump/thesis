    "content": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nToken Communities, Ltd. (hereinafter the Company, Our, We or Us) researches and creates white paper analysis for companies regarding block chain technology, and also operated the Lukki Exchange, including until its sale in April 2022. The Lukki Exchange offers its users the user-friendly interface an in-depth experience in crypto assets trading. We do not believe the operation of the Lukki Exchange triggers any obligations under the Securities Act or Securities Exchange Act, including any requirements to register as a national securities exchange, alternative trading system or broker-dealer, or any obligations to register with the CFTC as a futures exchange. The Lukki Exchange is operated outside of the United States (China), and not available to citizens of the United States. Further the LOT is not a security as established in the US Supreme Court case of SEC v Howey. The Howey Test has remained a notable determiner of regulatory oversight for many decades. In the past few years, it has been called into question, most frequently in conjunction with discussions about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. In SEC v Howey, the Supreme Court articulated the legal standard for determining when a financial arrangement may be deemed an investment contract and, therefore, a security. As Howey and its progeny explain, a financial arrangement is an investment contract if the arrangement involves (1) an investment of money; (2) in a common enterprise; (3) with a reasonable expectation of profits to be (4) derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. The Howey Test determines that a transaction represents an investment contract if a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party, Here there is no evidence of investors reasonable expectation of profits derived predominantly from the managerial efforts of others. In recent years, the SEC has ruled that the two most valuable cryptocurrencies-Bitcoin and Ethereum-are not securities, Further we do not undertake any brokerage activities including marketing and facilitating the sale of digital assets, accepting investors orders and funds for payment, and enabling the disbursement of proceeds. We do not receive compensation based on a percentage of the proceeds raised. We also do not purchase and then resell LOT for accounts in the Company name.\nBackground\nToken Communities Ltd. was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 6, 2014, under the name Pacific Media Group Enterprises, Inc. On April 7, 2017, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware, changing its name to Extract Pharmaceuticals Inc. On January 26, 2018, the Board of Directors adopted an Amendment to its Articles, changing its name to Token Communities Ltd. The Company researches and creates white paper analysis for companies regarding block chain technology, and also operates the Lukki Exchange, including all client lists, intellectual property related to the brand Lukki.\nOn February 26, 2018, the Company entered into an Acquisition and Share Exchange Agreement with Token Communities PLC, a Gibraltar company (PLC) whereby PLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. PLC is a Gibraltar Financial Advisory firm which specializes in Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence and Fin-Tech investment in incubating as well as advising and managing qualified companies in the blockchain and distributed ledger technologies arena, including smart contracts, TGEs, DApps, and more. Advisement comprises the authoring of industry standard White Papers, technical aspects, design and implementation of market strategies, business appraisal and more. All potential clients are vetted and Anti-Money Laundering / Know-Your-Customer approved. The Company is also developing its own software technology with its dedicated team of developers.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 4802 Lena Road, Unit 105, Bradenton, Florida, 34211 and our telephone number is (631) 397-1111.\nOur Company\nThe Company researches and creates white paper analysis for companies regarding block chain technology, and also operates the Lukki Exchange until its sale in April 2022.\nLOT Token\nLukki Exchange also has its native exchange token - the LOT token. It was developed to make the Lukki Exchange more functional and transparent for providing the best trading experience on the exchange and create an incredible investment ability for traders. LOT tokens are ERC20 tokens based on ethereum chain. The LOT token is listed on several exchanges, such as STEX.com, P2PB2B.io, Whitebit.io, and Lukki.io. A total amount of 2,000,000,000 LOT tokens have been issued. The Company holds 1,999,321,726 LOT Tokens.\nIntellectual Property\nWe do not currently own, and do not have any current plans to seek, any patents in connection with our existing and planned blockchain and cryptocurrency related operations. We do not have any copyrights, trademarks, but we generally rely upon copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect and maintain our proprietary rights for our technology and products. Notwithstanding the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights. Competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the technologies we employ in our products and services.\nCompetition\nThere are many companies offering or developing blockchain solutions, and there can be no assurance that direct competitors to our solutions will arise. Our technology is designed to be compliant with the new GDPR and other Governmental regulations and initiatives to protect the consumers data but there is no guarantee that it will be in compliance. The markets for our products are intensely competitive, continually evolving and subject to changing technologies. We face significant competition, including from companies that have entered this space much earlier than us and are better capitalized, with vertically integrated business models, larger than us, have more access to capital and have lower operating costs than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products. These competitors may enter our existing or future markets with currencies that may be less expensive, that may provide higher performance or additional features or that may be introduced more quickly than our products.\nIndustry\nA blockchain, also known as a distributed ledger technology, is a sequential, ever-growing, time-stamped set of records that are grouped in blocks and maintained by disparate participants. Each block is interdependent, making alterations of records economically difficult if not outright impossible. A Blockchain includes, but is not limited to, the following features:\n\u25cf decentralized and distributed digital ledger used to record and secure transactions, which deters fraud.\n\u25cf transactions cannot be changed.\n\u25cf transactions can be verified and audited.\n\u25cf confirmation that each unit of value was transferred only once.\nThe blockchain, being a globally distributed ledger running on millions of devices, is capable of recording transfers of anything of value. Two or more parties, be they businesses or individuals who may not even know each other, can forge agreements, make transactions, and build value without relying on intermediaries (such as banks, payment institutions, rating agencies and other third parties) to verify their identities, establish trust, or perform the critical business logic contracting, clearing, settling, and record-keeping tasks that are foundational to all forms of commerce. As opposed to a centralized database whereby an entire database, or full copies of that database, remains in the control of one person or entity stored on a computer that is controlled or owned by that same person or entity, a blockchain ledger typically has partial copies of itself across various nodes, or computers, in the network. Each new block requires a method of consensus between nodes of the network in order for the block to post to the ledger and become permanent. There are various methods being developed for executing a consensus. Currently, the most popular blockchain is Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, which uses a mathematical problem to be solved before it can be confirmed and added to its blockchain. Cryptocurrencies are a medium of exchange that are transacted through and recorded on a blockchain and therefore within our scope of business. The Bitcoin consensus process, for example, entails solving complex mathematical problems using custom designed computers. However, many more public and private blockchains are being developed with different algorithms or consensus models, which can use different hardware and methods for performing function of adding blocks to their blockchains.\nCryptocurrencies are currencies that are not backed by a central bank or a national, supra-national or quasi-national organization and are not typically backed by hard assets or other credit. Cryptocurrencies are typically used as a medium of exchange, similar to fiat currencies like the U.S. Dollar. In addition to cryptocurrencies, there are other assets such as contracts or other information that reside on a blockchain that represent a form of ownership. Examples may include insurance contracts, deeds, wills, health data, or securities. The value of is determined by the value that various market participants place on them through their transactions, for example, via peer-to-peer transactions, e-commerce, or exchanges.\nGovernment Regulation\nGovernment regulation of blockchain and cryptocurrency is being actively considered by the United States federal government through various agencies and regulatory bodies, as well as other countries and transnational organizations, such as the European Union. State and local regulations also may apply to our activities such and other activities in which we participate or may participate in the future. Other governmental or semi-governmental regulatory bodies have shown an interest in regulating or investigating companies engaged in the blockchain or cryptocurrency business. For instance, the SEC has taken an active role in regulating the use of public offerings of proprietary coins (so-called Initial Coin Offerings) and has made statements and official promulgations as to the status of certain cryptocurrencies as securities subject to regulation by the SEC.\nPresently, we do not believe any U.S. or State regulatory body has taken any action or position adverse to our main cryptocurrency, Lukki, with respect to its production, sale, and use as a medium of exchange; however, future changes to existing regulations or entirely new regulations may affect our business in ways it is not presently possible for us to predict with any reasonable degree of reliability. As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws, further regulation by the SEC and other agencies, which may affect our mining and other activities. For additional discussion regarding our belief about the potential risks existing and future regulation pose to our business, see the Section entitled Risk Factors herein and in our other SEC filings, which are incorporated by reference herein.\nEmployees\nCurrently we and our subsidiaries employ a total of eight individuals. These individuals consist of management, developers, sales and support staff. Some of these individuals are employed through outside sourcing companies. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nSmaller reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nThe Company is neither an accelerated filer nor a large accelerated filer, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act (\u00a7240.12b-2 of this chapter), nor is it a well-known seasoned issuer as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act (\u00a7230.405 of this chapter), and as such is not required to provide the information required by this item. Item 2. Properties.\nCurrently the Company utilizes offices provided by the President of the Company no charge. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nNeither the Company nor its property is a party to any pending material legal proceeding. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information\nThe registration of each class of the Companys securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 was revoked effective October 15, 2020 because it failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder because it had not timely filed any periodic reports with the SEC since the period ended June 30, 2018. The Company has applied for a trading symbol but has not received confirmation as of the date of this Report and there is no guarantee that the Company will obtain a trading symbol.\nHolders\nAs of October 4, 2022, there were 2,095,671,162 shares of common stock outstanding, which were held by approximately 162 record holders.\nDividends\nThrough June 30, 2022, we have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2022, there were no sales by the Company (which have not been included in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or in a Current Report on Form 8-K) that were not registered under the Securities Act. Item 6. [Reserved] Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\nPlan of Operation\nToken Communities Ltd. (the Company or Limited) researches and creates white paper analysis for companies regarding block chain technology, and also operates the Lukki Exchange, (until its sale in April 2022) including all client lists, intellectual property related to the brand Lukki.\nResults from Operations - For the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to June 30, 2021\nRevenue\nFor the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had total sales of $0 and $0, respectively. The lack of revenues was due to the inability of the Company to generate sales.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses decreased to $318,564 in 2022 from $1,790,381 in 2021, a decrease of $1,471,817. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in both rent and salary during the year from the shutdown that occurred in China during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.\nLoss From Operations\nAs a result of the foregoing, our loss from operations was $318,564 for the year ended June 30, 2022, compared with $1,790,381, for the year ended June 30, 2021. The decrease in our overall loss from operations was a result of a slowdown in business operations and a decrease in General and Administrative expenses in Shenzhen.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther Income (Expense) decreased from $262,115 in 2021 to $50,000 in 2022. This decrease was due to one-time debt forgiveness recognized in the prior year. During the year end December 31, 2022 the income was related to the sale of the lukki exchange.\nNet Income (Loss)\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022 the Company had net loss of $268,564 compared to a net loss of $1,528,265 for the year ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of $1,259,701. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in operations as discussed above related to Shenzen.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of June 30, 2022, the Company had $51,148 in Total Assets, consisting of $312 in cash, $50,000 in deposits, and $836 in other assets. The Companys total liabilities exceeded its consolidated current assets by approximately $1,993,493 as of June 30, 2022 primarily due to $1,258,678 due to related parties. Total liabilities exceeded its consolidated current assets by approximately and $1,753,869 as of June 30, 2021.\nAs of June 30, 2022, the Company has yet to achieve profitable operations, and while the Company hopes to achieve profitable operations in the future, if not it may need to raise capital from stockholders or other sources to sustain operations and to ultimately achieve viable operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The Companys principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operating activities, as well as its ability to raise capital. The Companys operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and it is uncertain if the Company will be able to become profitable and continue growth for the foreseeable future. If management is not able to increase revenue and/or manage operating expenses, the Company may not be able to maintain profitability. The Companys ability to continue in existence is dependent on the Companys ability to achieve profitable operations.\nTo continue operations for the next 12 months we will have a cash need of approximately $500,000. Should we not be able to fulfill our cash needs through the increase of revenue we will need to raise money through outside investors through convertible notes, debt or similar instrument(s), the Company has no committed external source of funds, and there is no guarantee we would be able to raise such funds. The Company plans to pay off current liabilities through sales and increasing revenue through sales of Company services and or products, or through financing activities as mentioned above.\nOur cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 are summarized below:\nYear\nEnding\nJune 30,\nYear\nEnding\nJune 30,\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (318,564 ) $ (850,541 )\nNet cash used in investing activities $ 0 $ 0\nNet cash provided by financing activities $ 336,887 $ 928,407\nNet Change in Cash $ 0 $ 0\nCash at beginning of year $ 312 $ 312\nCash at end of year $ 312 $ 312\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022, ($318,564) net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to loss from operations, as well as the increase in deposits for the Lukki exchange sale. For the year ended June 30, 2021, ($850,541) net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to loss from operations.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $0.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities was $336,887 as compared to $928,407 for the year ended June 30, 2021. The change was due to an advance from a related party.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLoss Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company considers the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as its ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets (future tax benefits) and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the expected future tax return consequences of those differences, which are expected to be either deductible or taxable when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are not currently a party to, or otherwise involved with, any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606, or ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 establishes the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP. The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. In applying the new revenue recognition model to contracts with customers, an entity: (1) identifies the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identifies the performance obligations in the contract(s); (3) determines the transaction price; (4) allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract(s); and (5) recognizes revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The accounting standards update applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The accounting standards update also requires significantly expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopt ed ASU 2014-09 effective January 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard had no material impact on the Companys financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nPursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (\u00a7 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1). Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nReport of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 6778)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity for the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements -\nGries & Associates, LLC\nCertified Public Accountants\n400 South Colorado Blvd, Ste 870\nDenver, Colorado 80246\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Shareholders\nToken Communities, Ltd.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Token Communities, Ltd. (the Company) as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, statements of stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the two years then ended, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the entitys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entitys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nGoing Concern Uncertainty\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred losses since inception of $3,278,152. These factors create an uncertainty as to the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nEmphasis of Matters-Risks and Uncertainties.\nThe Company is not able to predict the ultimate impact that COVID -19 will have on its business. However, if the current economic conditions continue, the pandemic could have an adverse impact on the economies and\nfinancial markets of many countries, including the geographical area in which the Company plans to operate.\n/s/ Gries & Associates, LLC\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2021.\nDenver, CO\nOctober 13, 2022\nPCAOB# 6778\nblaze@griesandassociates.com\n501 S.

AND SUBSIDIARY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation\nOrganization and Line of Business\nToken Communities Ltd. (the Company or Limited) was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 6, 2014, under the name Pacific Media Group Enterprises, Inc. On April 7, 2017, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware, changing its name to Extract Pharmaceuticals Inc. On January 26, 2018, the Board of Directors adopted an Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation, changing its name to Token Communities Ltd. The Company is a development stage company that researches and creates white paper analysis for companies regarding block chain technology.\nOn February 26, 2018, the Company entered into an Acquisition and Share Exchange Agreement with Token Communities PLC (PLC). Under the Agreement, the Companys majority shareholder returned 19,266,000 common shares to treasury, and at closing 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of PLC were acquired by the Company, for 172,800,000 newly issued common shares equal to 64% of the Companys outstanding common stock as of the closing date, thus making the stockholders of PLC the majority stockholders of the Company. The transaction closed on May 18, 2018. This transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting since PLC obtained control of Limited. Accordingly, the merger of PLC into Limited was recorded as a recapitalization of PLC, PLC being treated as the continuing entity. The transaction was treated as a recapitalization and not as a business combination. Limited had 116,466,000 shares outstanding prior to the merger. At the time of the merger, Limiteds principal stockholder surrendered 19,266,000 shares, which were cancelled. After the merger the total number of Limited shares outstanding was 270,000,000.\nPLC is a Gibraltar Financial Advisory firm which specializes in Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence and Fin-Tech investment in incubating as well as advising and managing qualified companies in the blockchain and distributed ledger technologies arena, including smart contracts, TGEs, DApps, and more. Advisement comprises the authoring of industry standard White Papers, technical aspects, design and implementation of market strategies, business appraisal and more. All potential clients are vetted and Anti-Money Laundering / Know-Your-Customer approved. The Company is also developing its own software technology with its dedicated team of developers.\nThe historical financial statements presented are the financial statements of PLC. The Acquisition and Share Exchange Agreement was treated as a recapitalization and not as a business combination; therefore, no pro forma information is disclosed. At the date of the merger, the net liabilities of the legal acquirer, Limited, were $57,107.\nThe combined entities are referred to hereafter as the Company.\nOn May 28, 2020, the Company acquired 3.5 billion iRide tokens in exchange for 80 million shares provided to iRide.io Tech Pte., Ltd., valued at $8,000, which was immediately expensed.\nOn July 14, 2020, a change in control of the Company was affected by a privately held corporation (American Software Company, controlled by 2 individuals) acquiring 83% of the outstanding stock from other control individuals. As part of this transaction, the Company transferred the 3.5 billion iRide tokens and 1,745,406 shares of its common stock to American Software in exchange for all technology, software codes and other intelligent products of the Lukki Exchange, a non-operating cyber coin exchange. Since the Lukki exchange had no previous material revenue nor assets, the acquisition has been accounted for as an asset acquisition and due to the facts that it has no value, and the parties to this transaction are related, the transaction has been accounted for as $(0), the value of the tokens are $(0), and no financial statements are being provided as part of the transaction.\nAs a condition to the closing of the transactions contemplated in the Asset Purchase Agreement shareholders agreed to cancel an aggregate of 174,540,600 shares of Common Stock of the Company, and the holders of the Companys Series A, B, C, D and E warrants agreed to the cancellation of all such warrants.\nOn April 25, 2022 the Company closed on the sale of the Lukki Exchange and related Lukki tokens in exchange for Fifty Thousand Dollars. With the sale of the Lukki Exchange the Company instead will only be involved in the advisory and consulting or companies regarding block chain technology\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements (CFS) were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). Limiteds functional currency is the United States Dollars ($ or USD) and Limiteds wholly-owned subsidiary, PLCs functional currency is the Pound Sterling (GBP).\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying CFS were prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates the continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company had a stockholders deficit of $3,278,152 at June 30, 2022 and has incurred losses from operations since inception and expects to continue to generate operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The continued operations of the Company are dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital, obtain additional financing and/or acquire or develop a business that generates sufficient positive cash flows from operations.\nThe accompanying CFS do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue as a going concern.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe accounts of Limited are maintained in USD and the accounts of PLC are maintained in GBP. The accounts of PLC are translated into USD in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 830 Foreign Currency Transaction , with the GBP as the functional currency. According to Topic 830, all assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, stockholders equity is translated at historical rates and statement of operations items are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income . Gains and losses resulting from the translations of foreign currency transactions and balances are reflected in the statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The following table details the exchange rates used for the periods.\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nPeriod end: GBP to USD exchange rate $ 1.21 $ 1.37\nAverage period: GBP to USD exchange rate $ 1.30 $ 1.31\nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of CFS in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the CFS and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Companys estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying CFS include the accounts of Limited and its wholly-owned Subsidiary, PLC. All significant intercompany transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation.\nCash Equivalents\nFor the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash equivalents include time deposits, certificate of deposits, and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are recorded, net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentration, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to determine if the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate. An estimate for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Delinquent account balances are written-off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable and known bad debts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when identified. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was zero, respectively.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFor certain of the Companys financial instruments, including cash and equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, trust liability and advances, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities.\nFASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, requires disclosure of the fair value (FV) of financial instruments held by the Company. FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, defines FV, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of FV measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for FV measures. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their FVs because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:\n\u25cf Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n\u25cf Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\n\u25cf Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology use one or more unobservable inputs which are significant to the FV measurement.\nThe Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under FASB ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, and FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging.\nThe Company uses Level 2 inputs for its valuation methodology for derivative liabilities as their fair values were determined by using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model based on various assumptions. nys derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect FV at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the FV being recorded in results of operations as adjustments to fair value of derivatives.\nRevenue Recognition\nASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), became effective for the Company on July 1, 2018. The Companys revenue recognition disclosure reflects its updated accounting policies that are affected by this new standard. The Company applied the modified retrospective transition method for open contracts for the implementation of Topic 606. As sales are and have been primarily from advisory fees and related services, and the Company has no significant post-delivery obligations, this did not result in a material recognition of revenue on our accompanying CFS for the cumulative impact of applying this new standard. The Company made no adjustments to its previously-reported total revenues, as those periods continue to be presented in accordance with its historical accounting practices under Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.\nRevenue from advisory fees and related services are recognized under Topic 606 in a manner that reasonably reflects the delivery of services to customers in return for expected consideration and includes the following elements:\n\u25cf executed contract(s) with our customer(s) that we believe is legally enforceable;\n\u25cf identification of performance obligation in the respective contract;\n\u25cf determination of the transaction price for each performance obligation in the respective contract;\n\u25cf allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation; and\n\u25cf recognition of revenue only when the Company satisfies each performance obligation.\nThese five elements, as applied to the Companys only revenue category, are summarized below:\n\u25cf Advisory fees and related services - the Company charges advisory fees for a suite of one to two dozen services that include advising on where to establish a corporation, establishing the corporation (often Gibraltar or Malta), writing white paper, setting up website, making videos or animations describing the company and its business, engaging in public relations, and introducing potential investors.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. ASC 740 requires a company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\nUnder ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company has no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented.\nBasic and Diluted Earnings (loss) Per Share\nEarnings per share is calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share (EPS) is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is based on the assumption that all dilutive securities are converted. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. There were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding during any of the periods presented in these financial statements.\nForeign Currency Transactions and Comprehensive Income\nU.S. GAAP generally requires recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. Certain statements, however, require entities to report specific changes in assets and liabilities, such as gain or loss on foreign currency translation, as a separate component of the equity section of the balance sheet. Such items, along with net income, are components of comprehensive income. The functional currency of the Companys subsidiary is the GBP. Translation loss of $5,603 at June 30, 2022 is classified as an item of other comprehensive income in the stockholders deficit section of the balance sheet.\nStatement of Cash Flows\nCash flows from the Companys operations are calculated based upon the local currencies using the average translation rates. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the statements of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheets.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards could have a material effect on the accompanying CFS. As new accounting pronouncements are issued, we will adopt those that are applicable under the circumstances.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China and caused significant disruptions to its economy, it has now spread to several other countries and infections have been reported globally fiscal first quarter and potentially beyond.\nBecause COVID-19 infections have been reported throughout the United States, certain federal, state and local governmental authorities have issued stay-at-home orders, proclamations and/or directives aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19. Additional, more restrictive proclamations and/or directives may be issued in the future. As a result, all of our office locations have been closed effective April 1, 2020.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Companys operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or the Company, may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption, reduced customer traffic and reduced operations. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but is anticipated to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe measures taken to date will impact the Companys business for the fiscal fourth quarter and potentially beyond. Management expects that all of its business segments, across all of its geographies, will be impacted to some degree, but the significance of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Companys business and the duration for which it may have an impact cannot be determined at this time.\nManagements Evaluation of Subsequent Events\nThe Company evaluates events that have occurred after the balance sheet date of June 30, 2022, through the date which the CFS were issued. Based upon the review, the Company did not identify any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the CFS.\nNOTE 3 - ACCRUED EXPENSES\nAccrued expenses payable consisted of the following at June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021:\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nDirector fees $ 236,582 $ 236,582\nAccrued professional services 31,000 31,000\nOther 86,960 86,960\nTotal Accrued Expenses $ 354,542 $ 354,542\nNote 4 - Stockholders Equity\nAs of June 30, 2022, the authorized share capital of the Company consists of 5,000,000,000 shares of common and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock with $0.0001 par value. Each outstanding share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a stockholder vote. All shares of common stock are non-assessable and non-cumulative, with no pre-emptive rights.\nPrior to the transaction described in Note 1, the Company had 116,466,000 shares of common stock outstanding. At the time of the merger, a principal shareholder surrendered 19,266,000 shares of common stock, which were cancelled. Also at the time of the merger, 172,800,000 shares of common stock were issued for all of the issued and outstanding shares of PLC. The total shares outstanding at June 30, 2019 was 270,000,000. See Note 1 above.\nPrior to the transaction, the Company had 135,000,000 warrants outstanding consisting of 27,000,000 A Warrants each convertible into one share of common stock at $0.074; 27,000,000 B Warrants each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.093; 27,000,000 C Warrants each convertible into one share of common stock at $0.111; 27,000,000 D Warrants each convertible into one share of common stock at $0.129; and 27,000,000 E Warrants each convertible into one share of common stock at $0.148.\nOn February 19, 2019, the Company and the holders of 81,000,000 Warrants executed an Amendment and Modification Agreement, changing the warrant exercise prices from $0.074 to $0.148, to $1.90 for all classes of warrants it held. On the same day the Company and the holders of 43,200,000 warrants split equally between Class B, C, D and E (10,800,000 per class) executed an Amendment and Modification Agreement, changing the warrant exercise price to a phased strike price ranging between $1.05 and $2.00. Previously the holder of 10,800,000 A Warrants also entered into an amendment and modification agreement, changing the warrant strike price ranging from $1.05 to $2.00\nFollowing the transaction described in Note 1, last year a number of warrants which had previously been issued have been under review by the Company to ensure their original terms and conditions were not out of synchronization with the business plans overall of the newly restructured company going forward. One warrant holder of A Class warrants requested the original terms of his warrants be amended to accommodate the anticipated rise in value execution of the business plan would be expected to have on the Company value. Increases in the warrant strike price benefits the Company as increased funds are raised and placed directly in the company upon the exercise of the warrant. Accordingly the Company consented to vary the strike price on an increasing sliding scale from $1.05 to $2.00. Following a review post the recent share fluctuations, management and the other warrant holders agreed it is in the best interests of the Company, stock and warrant holders that the remaining warrants are also amended to follow the precedent set in respect of the previously amended warrant conditions. With the exception of the A Class warrants already amended as detailed above the remaining warrants have been extended to expire on August 30, 2022. This was finalized on February 21, 2019.\nThe warrants were cancelled subsequent to the year ended June 30, 2020.\nOn July 23, 2019, the Company issued 80,000,000 shares as part of an acquisition whose terms were considered immaterial.\nOn June 30, 2020 the Company issued 277,200 shares of common stock in settlement of debt of $268,942.\nOn July 14, 2020, the Company issued 1,745,000,585 shares as part of the acquisition agreement described in Note 1. This resulted in an expense on the income statement in the amount of $174,500.\nOn August 12, 2020, the Company issued 595,162 shares of common stock for services with a deemed value of $595,162.\nNote 5 - Related Party Transactions\nAmounts due to a related party are for advances made by a stockholder of the Company. The balance due of $1,258,676 and $927,987 as at June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 respectively, is presented as due to related parties in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The amounts due are non-interest bearing and payable upon demand. In the period ended June 30, 2021, certain related parties forgave advances and accrued expenses in the amount of $262,116. This resulted in a gain on forgiveness of debt on the income statement in the amount of $262,116.\nNote 6 - Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is party to certain legal proceedings from time to time incidental to the conduct of its business. These proceedings could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary relief. The nature of legal proceedings is such that the Company cannot assure the outcome of any particular matter, and an unfavorable ruling or development could have a materially adverse effect on the Companys CFS in the period in which a ruling or settlement occurs. However, based on information available to the Companys management to date, the Companys management does not expect the outcome of any matter pending against the Company is likely to have a material effect on the Companys CFS.\nOn July 6, 2018 PLC entered into a binding agreement to purchase 75% of new issued ordinary shares of i-Deal Corp Limited, which has developed a communication platform for Publicly Listed, Private companies and investors around the globe. i-Deal Corp Limited established the i-DX communication platform for companies and investors and has more than 2,000 diverse users. The i-DX platform has seen activity from more than 40 countries with placings of equity and debt across a broad range of industries including oil and gas, real estate, automotive, pharmaceuticals, beverages, software, mining, alternative energy, and financial services These users include listed and private companies, and blockchain companies; private and institutional investors; investment companies (angel investors and VCs); and P2P lending funds. The platform is also used by intermediaries representing multiple clients to reach international investors to enlarge their existing distribution network. i-Dx is exclusively a communication platform that matches and allows companies and potential investors to initially contact each other. i-Deal Corp Limited and i-DX does not transact, promote, advise, make recommendations, trade, bring about or earn commission on any financial transactions.\nIn order for the transaction to become effective it was acknowledged by both parties that the Company needs to raise the required funding to finance the transaction. Both parties agreed that the date for the first closing ($500,000) will take place by bank transfer no later than mid-March 2019. The following payments will be 90 days later (i.e. on or before May 31, 20219) as follows: $2,250,000 by way of bank transfer and $2,250,000 by the issue of 2,250,000 new shares of common stock of the Company. As of the date of this report the transaction had not yet closed and the Company does not anticipate this will close.\nOn April 2, 2019, the Company executed an Acquisition and Exchange Agreement with Lalit Kumar Verma and Manickam Mahalingam, who together control 100% of the common shares of ABT Auto Investments Ltd., a private English company. Pursuant to the Agreement, Messrs. Verma and Mahalingam were to exchange 96,001 shares, representing 100% of the common shares of ABT Auto Investments Ltd for a total of 3,530,000,000 new issue treasury shares issued by the Company, representing 95% ownership of the Company. On June 20, 2019, the Company executed a Mutual Rescission and Release Agreement, mutually rescinding the Acquisition and Exchange Agreement with Fortress Ventures LLC represented by Lalit Kumar Verma and with ABT Investments India Pvt Ltd represented by Manickam Mahalingam. The Mutual Rescission and Release agreement executed and became effective as of June 20, 2019. As a consequence of its execution and the rescinding of the Share Exchange and Acquisition Agreement, the Company will not issue the 3,530,000,000 shares of common stock. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe have performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President, and our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2022.
