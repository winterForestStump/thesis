    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS.\nCorporate History\nHoops Scouting USA was incorporated on October 31, 2016 under the laws of the State of Wyoming. We offer a basketball website for high school basketball players with aspirations of playing post-secondary basketball. Our website www.hoopsscoutingusa.com (the Website) will be the main hub and we are developing an app that will work in unison with the Website.\nWe are in the development stage, and have not realized any revenues from our operations. Jamie Oei has served as our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer since our inception. Our board of director is comprised of one person: Jamie Oei. Our officer and director, Jamie Oei, currently lives in Canada, and our current assets are located in the United States. We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings.\nWe received our initial funding of $50 through the sale of common stock from our officer and director, who purchased (500,000 before split) 37,500,000 shares of common stock at $0.0001 per share. During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company received $32,000 of share subscriptions relating to a private placement of common shares at $0.10 per share. During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company received $3,000 of share subscriptions relating to a private placement of common shares at $0.10 per share. On October 15, 2021, the Company issued (350,000 before split) 26,250,000 common shares at $0.10 per share relating to private placement proceeds of $35,000 that was received as of September 30, 2021. In furtherance of our business plan, on February 17, 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Grit Performance Athletics Inc. (Grit Performance) to acquire all right, title and interest of Grit Performance and its Affiliates in the Grit Mobile Application and related products, including website, Instagram account, etc. (the Assets). The Assets are valued at $100,000 and were paid for by the issuance of (500,000 before split) 37,500,000 restricted shares of our common stock to Grit Performance.\nHoops Scouting USA is a basketball scouting website for high school basketball players with aspirations of playing post-secondary basketball. The Hoops Scouting USA website will allow high school players to set up accounts, which include game film, schedules for high school and AAU games, stats, and high school academic marks. This will allow coaches to be able to see players and their stats and can plan their recruiting with the team schedules. This brings international recruiting to the desk of every college coach in the United States from Division 1, Division 2, Divisions 3, NAIA, and Junior College.\nOur products and products description\nHoops Scouting USA is a basketball website for high school basketball players with aspirations of playing post-secondary basketball. It is also an avenue for smaller university coaches who do not have the means to recruit larger areas of the United States and Internationally.\nHoops Scouting USA will allow high school players to set up accounts which include game film, schedules for high school and AAU games, stats, and high school academic marks. This will allow coaches to be able to see players and their stats and can plan their recruiting with the team schedules. This brings international recruiting to the desk of every college coach in the United States from Division 1, Division 2, Divisions 3, NAIA, and Junior College.\nThis also allows players from Europe, Australia, Asia, and South America to pursue opportunities in the United States to schools that would normally not be able to recruit in such a wide range. Many of the larger schools with bigger recruiting budgets are often the only ones to be able to see these international players. Often only the top players get a chance and the second and third tier players do not get a chance to be recruited. This will all change with Hoops Scouting USA.\nThe website will be the main hub but being able to upload stats and game film directly from a smart phone will allow players and coaches to get almost immediate information. Development of an app to allow this will eventually work in unison with the website.\nRevenue will be split between several revenue streams.\n1.\nPlayer Membership\na.\nPlayers sign up for full memberships which allow players to upload unlimited videos to or website and app\nb.\nPlayers sign up for partial memberships to upload one or two videos at a time.\n2.\nCoaching Membership - Coaches sign up to receive emails and check players.\n3.\nSponsorship- Website and app will have sponsors who can display their ads on videos or on the website or the app. Sponsors can receive info from the company on what pages and what videos are being viewed the most.\nA small fee for players and coaches will be invoked but sponsorship on the website and the app will be the main source of revenue.\nWe are planning to offer basketball merchandise including sweaters, jerseys and shorts for sale on our website. We have obtained some inventory but the online store is not yet active.\nIn furtherance of our business plan, on February 17, 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Grit Performance Athletics Inc. (Grit Performance) to acquire all right, title and interest of Grit Performance and its Affiliates in the Grit Mobile Application and related products, including website, Instagram account, etc. (the Assets). The Assets are valued at $100,000 and were paid for by the issuance of (500,000 before split) 37,500,000 restricted shares of our common stock to Grit Performance.\nThe Grit app is an on demand digital training platform. It is designed for high level on and off court training for the serious athlete. The app was designed by professionals with over 30 years of experience in training who have coached some of the best athletes in the world. The app is designed to make training easier and allows users to train more efficiently.\nGrit App was developed for young players to train on their own anywhere anytime and be able to do the drills that the best professionals in the world work on during their off-season training. Basketball has risen to the second most popular sport in the world. Players in the NBA are now coming from many international countries and people all over the world want to train like the NBA players do. Not everyone has access to pro trainers. The Grit App brings us closer than ever to working with top players and trainers.\nAbout the Gritt App\nHigh level on and off court training for the relentless designed by professionals. GRIT was created to help eliminate the guess work from your training. Follow custom workout plans or build your own featuring workout segments daily created for your needs and level to take your game to the next level. Everything is designed to be done on your own (or with a partner). All you need is a basketball, a hoop, your device to view the app and a work ethic. Our coaching staff has worked with and coached (professionally) some of the best athletes in the world and has experience working with athletes of all ages and skill levels across the globe. All workouts contain drill videos from our 1000+ drill library in high resolution. Each drill has a tangible goal tracking reps or time to complete and is recorded right in the app so you can see if you are tangibly improving.\nThe Grit App will operate seamlessly with the Hoops Scouting USA and be able to market to all Hoops a Scouting USA users and give them a deal on training or build packages that give them access to Hoops Scouting USA and the app for a single package price.\nGrit App currently offers THE DAILY GRIND: GRIT + PREMIUM ZONE - One stop shop for the modern driven athlete. Daily workouts segments for custom programming tailored to your exact needs, comprehensive workout plans for specific improvement, inspiration, articles, videos, knowledge, discounts on GRIT products, strength & conditioning and more. Designed, created, managed and updated daily by professional coaches, trainers and athletes. This is the place to take your game to the next level. We have been where you want to go and we want to share our knowledge with you or how to achieve your aspirations.\nThe Grit App has the option for users sign up for monthly or yearly programs plus purchase individual workouts plans which they have lifetime access to. These levels are phased and encourage users to purchase the next progression of that portion of the app to enjoy 70 + workouts and workout segments with new workout added daily.\nIn the Grit App\nWe offer the following inside the app in addition to the video form workouts:\n\u00b7\nFree daily professionally programmed workouts (skill dev, shooting, ball handling, athletic dev., power, strength, mobility and yoga / injury prevention;\n\u00b7\nInformative Premium Content (advice, tips, basketball iq, sports psych etc.);\n\u00b7\nFilm Breakdown;\n\u00b7\nInterviews;\n\u00b7\nLive Zoom Q&A;\n\u00b7\nSupport from our staff of professional coaches and athletes from across the world via messages in the app;\n\u00b7\nCoaching Insight; and\n\u00b7\nBasketball IQ Seminars and Tips.\nWith NBA level talent both on the performance side and marketing side. Dougs network or players from university to pro, professional coaches globally and some of the most influential basketball trainers in the world (see Dribble2much and Chris Brickley) are untapped markets and will be included into the fold in revenue sharing programs to help generate a lot of eyeballs on the app. Both of these people are close friends with our team and are ready to get on board when we take the next step. Between the two there are 4 + million followers on Instagram.\nThere are other entities on the market however there are nothing as thorough, as real or as in depth as what the GRIT app does for the modern athlete on the market. This app was created by professional coaches not simply trainers, the flow of workouts and programs have been used with thousands of athletes from grade school to the NBA globally for 20+ years and features the GRIT proprietary 4 quarter workout plan which is an all-encompassing holistic development model for athletes incorporating elements of skill development, consistent testing, data input and comparison, weekly challenges, strength and conditioning, digital one on one coaching, video breakdown and digital mentorship + evaluation via currently College / University coaches - all inside the app.\nOur strategy with the Grit App is to recruit current and former NBA and NCAA players and coaches as well as respected trainers to have their workouts on the app and do a revenue share with them. This will allow them to sell the program on the app as their personal workout program and motivate them to sell it as they receive a portion of all revenues from their workout.\nHoops Scouting USA will continue to focus on basketball scouting services. The acquisition of the Grit App allows us to offer a separate product for those using Hoops Scouting USA app as well as having a separate revenue stream of people using the app only. We think we can use both products a separate entity as well as advertise each through each other.\nCustomers\nThe Gritt app currently has 3,500 customers. Our principal customers are youth to professional athletes globally there is something for all levels inside the app. Beginners to advanced segments and drills are housed inside the app. The guess work is taken out for athletes who choose to follow workout plans or to combine workout segments to fully customize their workouts.\nHistorical Operations:\nThe Grit App was founded in 2020 by professional basketball coach and trainer Doug Plumb. Doug has coached professionally in the NBL in Canada and was the 2022 NBL Coach of the year while leading the London Lighting to the NBL title. Doug has worked with multiple NBA players to refine their skills. Players such as NBA All-Stars, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, and Donovan Mitchell are just a few of the NBA stars to have trained with Doug. The app got 3,500+ users in the first two months of operation with no advertising.\nCurrent market trend\nA Stanford Business Article titled Five Key Trends That Are Driving the Business of Sports explains that the data are changing the way the game is played, shifting emphasis from how many total points a player scores to measures of player efficiency. It has been hard, historically, to quantify defense, said Brian Kopp, senior vice president of STATS, the company that developed SportVU player tracking. Now we have four camera views helping you do that. In addition, the data have influenced the types of shots players take on the court. All sports are at that point where, like in a lot of businesses, theyre using a lot of (data) to make better decisions.\nMarketing\nOur officer and director will promote our scouting service. We plan to market our products through the following methods: (i) our website, (ii) search engine optimization, (iii) social networking websites, (iv) printing, mailing and emailing catalogues and flyers to potential customers, (v) word of mouth, (vi), telephoning potential customers (vii) content marketing and (viii) paid ads. We hope to have repeat customers coming and buying new products online from our website.\nThe Grit app can take on advertisers which can be put on all user and franchisee pages of the app. HSU plans to use NBA, NCAA and other Professional as well as the worlds top trainers to help advertise the app. The profit share structure we plan to implement allows these players to advertise via social media and share in users profits. Marketing to date includes email marketing and brand deign, customer acquisition and marketing photography.\nCompetition\nThere are many well established companies in the industry such as Pure Sweat Training by Drew Hanlen which is another leading digital product. We expect to face medium to high level of resistance, and it will be up to our marketing efforts and negotiation skills to acquire customers. Most of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we do and will be able to withstand sales or price decreases better than we are. We also expect to continue to face competition from new market entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nInsurance\nWe do not maintain any insurance as of the date of this prospectus.\nEmployees\nWe currently have no employees. Our sole officer and director manages the day-to-day operations of the Company.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities in the future. As of now there are no required government approvals present that we need approval from or any existing government regulation on our business.\nPatents, trademarks and copyrights\nWe do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks. We intend to protect our website with copyright laws. Beyond our trade name, we do not hold any other intellectual property.\nBankruptcy or similar proceedings\nThere has been no bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and not required to include this disclosure in our Form 10-K annual report. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.\nOur executive offices are located at 63 Rocio Court, Palm Desert, CA 92260. Our telephone number is (760) 636-4353.

Our common stock is not traded on any exchange or on the over-the-counter market. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes thereto included herein. In connection with, and because we desire to take advantage of, the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution readers regarding certain forward-looking statements in the following discussion and elsewhere in this Report and in any other statement made by, or on our behalf, whether or not in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward looking statements are statements not based on historical information and which relate to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Forward looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and many of which, with respect to future business decisions, are subject to change. These uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on our behalf. We disclaim any obligation to update forward looking statements.\nAccounting and audit plan\nOur independent auditor is expected to charge us approximately $15,000 to review our quarterly financial statements and approximately $12,000 to audit our annual financial statements. In the next twelve months after completion of this offering, we anticipate spending approximately $27,000 to pay for our accounting and audit requirements.\nLimited operating history\nThere is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in startup stage operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.\nNeed for additional capital\nWe have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders.\nOff balance sheet arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nResults of operations\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2023, we incurred $141,457 of operating expenditures comprised of impairment expenses, inventory valuation adjustment, bank charges, professional fees, transfer agent and filing fees compared to $52,443 for the year ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in operating expenses is due to a decrease in professional fees, specifically including payment for legal services relating to our DTC eligibility application in 2022. Our accumulated deficit is $258,599 and we have not earned any revenues since our inception.\nSince inception, we have offered and sold (i) (500,000 before split) 37,500,000 shares of common stock to our officers and directors, at a purchase price of $0.0001 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $50. During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company received $32,000 of share subscriptions relating to a private placement of common shares at $0.10 per share. During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company received $3,000 of share subscriptions relating to a private placement of common shares at $0.10 per share. On October 15, 2021, the Company issued 350,000 common shares at $0.10 per share relating to private placement proceeds of $35,000 that was received as at September 30, 2021. During the year ended June 30, 2023 the Company issued 500,000 common shares at $0.20 to settle a promissory note of $100,000.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company had a cash balance and total assets of $44,623 compared to cash and total assets of $392 as at June 30, 2022. The decrease in cash was due to the proceeds received from the share subscriptions being used to pay day-to-day operating costs. As at June 30, 2023 and 2022, we had total liabilities of $168,172 and $82,484 respectively. Our working capital deficit was $107,549 as at June 30, 2023 compared to $66,092 at June 30, 2022.\nThe available capital reserves of the company are not sufficient for the company to remain operational. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, our officer and director, who is currently our sole shareholder, is owed $135,685 and $61,581, respectively, for paying expenses related to our operations since our inception. The amount owing is unsecured, bears no interest, and is payable on demand.\nWe are highly dependent upon the success of the private offerings of equity or debt securities, as described herein. Therefore, the failure thereof would result in the need to seek capital from other resources such as taking loans, which would likely not even be possible for the company. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing. If the company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its equity or debt securities, or secure a loan, the company would be required to cease business operations. As a result, investors would lose all of their investment.\nCash Flows\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2023, we used $372 of cash for operating activities compared to the use of $13,194 for operating activities during the year ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in the use of cash for operating activities was due to an increase in legal fees relating to our DTC eligibility from 2022.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company received $3,000 of share subscriptions relating to a private placement of common shares at $0.10 per share. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2023 is $100,000 and 2022 is $3,000.\nDuring the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we did not have any investing activities.\nGoing concern consideration\nOur auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. The amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting. The company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company including legal and accounting fees will be approximately $27,000.\nSummary of significant accounting policies\nBasis of presentation\nThe financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Companys fiscal year end is June 30.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. The asset and liability method provides that deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.\nA valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the company will not realize tax assets through future operations.\nUse of estimates\nManagement uses estimates and assumption in preparing these financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses.\nFair value of financial instruments\nASC 820, Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires the company to disclose, when reasonably attainable, the fair market values of its assets and liabilities which are deemed to be financial instruments. The companys financial instruments consist primarily of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, amounts due to a related party, and loans payable.\nPer share information\nThe Company computes net loss per share accordance with ASC 205 Earnings per Share. ASC 205 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS excludes all potentially dilutive shares if their effect is antidilutive. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe financial statements and supplementary financial information required by this Item are set forth immediately following the signature page and are incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our sole executive officer (who is our Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer), of the effectiveness of the design of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of June 30, 2023 pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2023 in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions (the SEC) rules and forms. This conclusion is based on findings that constituted material weaknesses. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, which currently consists of our sole executive officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO - 2013) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Our management concluded, as of June 30, 2022, that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Management realized there were deficiencies in the design or operation of the Companys internal control that adversely affected the Companys internal controls which management considers to be material weaknesses.\nIn performing the above-referenced assessment, management had concluded that as of June 30, 2023, there were deficiencies in the design or operation of our internal control that adversely affected our internal controls which management considers to be material weaknesses including those described below:\ni)\nLack of Formal Policies and Procedures. The Company utilizes a third-party independent contractor for the preparation of its financial statements. Although the financial statements and footnotes are reviewed by our management, we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment of such transactions. The third-party independent contractor is not involved in the day-to-day operations of the Company and may not be provided information from management on a timely basis to allow for adequate reporting/consideration of certain transactions.\nii)\nAudit Committee and Financial Expert. The Company does not have a formal audit committee with a financial expert, and thus the Company lacks the board oversight role within the financial reporting process. The Company also does not have a formal financial reporting process which has resulted in the Company being delinquent in its SEC filings on a quarterly and annual basis.\nOur management feels the weaknesses identified above have not had any material effect on our financial results. However, we are currently reviewing our disclosure controls and procedures related to these material weaknesses and expect to implement changes in the near term, including identifying specific areas within our governance, accounting and financial reporting processes to add adequate resources to potentially mitigate these material weaknesses.\nOur management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nBF Borgers CPA PC, our independent auditors for fiscal 2023, have not and were not required to conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for the year ended June 30, 2023. Sadler, Gibb & Associates LLC, our independent auditors for fiscal 2022, have not and were not required to conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for the year ended June 30, 2022. Saturna Group Chartered Professional Accountants LLP, our independent auditors for fiscal 2021, have not and were not required to conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended June 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within any company have been detected.

The compensation discussed herein addresses all compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to our named executive officers. There are no other stock option plans, retirement, pension, or profit-sharing plans for the benefit of our officers and directors other than as described herein.\nOutstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End\nThere are no current outstanding equity awards to our executive officers.\nAudit committee and conflicts of interest\nSince we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our directors. The board of directors has not established an audit committee and does not have an audit committee financial expert, nor has the board established a nominating committee. The board is of the opinion that such committees are not necessary since the company is an early development stage company and has only two directors, and to date, such directors have been performing the functions of such committees. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation, nominations, and audit issues that may affect management decisions.\nOther than as described above, we are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executive officers or directors.\nCompensation of Directors\nNone.\nSecurity Holders Recommendations to Board of Directors\nShareholders can direct communications to our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Jamie Oei, at our executive offices. However, while we appreciate all comments from shareholders, we may not be able to individually respond to all communications. We attempt to address shareholder questions and concerns in our press releases and documents filed with the SEC so that all shareholders have access to information about us at the same time. Mr. Oei collects and evaluates all shareholder communications. All communications addressed to our directors and executive officers will be reviewed by those parties unless the communication is clearly frivolous.\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL\nOWNERS AND MANAGEMENT\nThe following table sets forth certain information concerning the number of shares of our common stock owned beneficially as of the date of this Prospectus by: (i) each of our directors; (ii) each of our executive officers; and (iii) each person or group known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Unless otherwise indicated, the shareholders listed below possess sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares they own.\nAs of the date of this filing, there are 101,250,000 common shares issued and outstanding.\nName and Address of Beneficial Owner\nTitle of Class\nAmount &Nature of\nBeneficial Ownership(1)\nPercent of Class\n(%) (2)\nMr. Jamie Oei (3)\n63 Rocio Court Palm Desert, CA 92260\nCommon\n37,500,000\n37.037%\nGrit Performance Athletics Inc\n1010-1030 West Georgia Street\nVancouver, British Columbia\nV6E 2Y2, CA\nCommon\n37,500,000\n37.037%\n75,000,000\n74.074%\n(1)\nThe number and percentage of shares beneficially owned is determined under rules promulgated by the SEC and the information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Under such rules, beneficial ownership includes any shares as to which the individual has sole or shared voting power or investment power and also any shares which the individual has the right to acquire within 60 days through the exercise of any stock option or other right. The persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock shown that are beneficially owned by them, subject to community property laws where applicable and the information contained in the footnotes to this table.\n(2)\nBased on 101,250,000 common shares issued and outstanding, 0 shares issuable upon the exercise of stock purchase options within 60 days.\n(3)\nMr. Jamie Oei is the current President, CEO, Treasurer, Secretary and a Director of the Company. His beneficial ownership includes 37,500,000 common shares.\nChanges in Control\nThere are no present arrangements or pledges of the Companys securities, which may result in a change in control of the Company.\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS\nOn October 31, 2016, pursuant to a subscription agreement, we offered and sold (500,000 before split) 37,500,000 shares of common stock to our officer and director, Jamie Oei, at a purchase price of $0.0001 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $50. During 2016, our officer and director, who is currently our shareholder, advanced the company $6,898 to pay expenses. During 2019, our officer and director advanced the Company $5,000 to pay expenses and, during 2020 our officer and director advanced the Company $10,602 to pay expenses.

Our officer and director Jamie Oei is our promoter.\nCOMMISSION POSITION ON\nINDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES\nOur Articles of Incorporation and Wyoming law provide that none of our officers or directors will be personally liable to the Company or its stockholders for any damages as a result of any act or failure to act in his or her capacity as an officer or director unless it is proven that:\nThe officers or directors act or failure to act constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties as an officer or director; and, the breach of those duties involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law.\nThese provisions eliminate our rights and those of our stockholders to recover damages from an officer or director for his or her breach of a fiduciary duty unless such breach involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. The limitations summarized above, however, do not affect our ability or that of our stockholders to seek non-monetary remedies, such as an injunction or rescission, against an officer or director for his or her acts or failure to act.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and other persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nSubstantial Doubt about the Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Companys significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or are required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nWe determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s BF Borgers CPA PC\nBF Borgers CPA PC (PCAOB ID 5041)\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2023\nLakewood, CO\nDecember 7, 2023\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Hoops Scouting USA:\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Hoops Scouting USA (the Company) as of June 30, 2022, the related statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management.

Nature of Operations and Continuance of Business\nHoops Scouting USA (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Wyoming on October 31, 2016. The Company is in the business of scouting high school and college basketball players in Colorado.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak and any related adverse public health developments, has adversely affected workforces, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn. The impact on the Company has not been significant, but management continues to monitor the situation.\nThese financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations, and ultimately the attainment of profitable operations. During the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company had no revenues and incurred a net loss of $141,457. As at June 30, 2023, the Company has a working capital deficit of $107,549 and an accumulated deficit of $258,599. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Management plans to promote our website and develop the Hoops Scouting USA app to run in conjunction with the website. We are looking at potential partnerships with current scouting services and college sport sponsorship consulting firms.\n2. Significant Accounting Policies\n(a) Basis of Presentation\nThe results for the year ended June 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year. These financial statements and related footnotes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Companys Annual Report for the year ended June 30, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which management believes are necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the year ended June 30, 2023.\n(b) Use of Estimates and Judgments\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the processing of applying the Companys accounting policies. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to deferred income tax valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The impacts of such estimates and judgments are pervasive throughout the financial statements, and may require accounting adjustments based on future occurrences. Revisions to accounting estimates and judgments are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Companys estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.\n(c) Cash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.\n(d) Liquidity / Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Companys significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nHOOPS SCOUTING USA\nNotes to the financial statements\nYears ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in U.S. dollars)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\n(e) Income Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. The asset and liability method provides that deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.\n(f) Intangible assets consist of all right, title and interest of seller and its affiliates in the Grit Mobile Application and related complementary products acquired in an asset purchase agreement. The estimated useful life of these assets was determined to be zero years and amortized the full value of the intangible asset. The Company periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets. Once these assets are fully amortized, they are removed from the accounts. These assets are reviewed for impairment or obsolescence when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If impaired, intangible assets are written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows or other valuation techniques. The Company has no intangibles with indefinite lives.\n(g) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. To determine recoverability of a long-lived asset, management evaluates whether the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows from the asset are less than its carrying amount. If impairment is indicated, the long-lived asset would be written down to fair value. Fair value is determined by an evaluation of available price information at which assets could be bought or sold, including quoted market prices, if available, or the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on reasonable and supportable assumptions.\n(h) Loss Per Share\nThe Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260 Earnings per Share. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. There are no potentially issuable common shares as of June 30, 2023 or 2022.\n(i) Comprehensive Loss\nASC 220, Comprehensive Income establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements. As at June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no items that affected comprehensive loss.\n( j) Inventory\nThe Company values inventory at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in first-out method, which is calculated by counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each item based upon the actual purchase cost of each item and reporting the costs of each item sold. The Company records a valuation allowance based upon the aging of the inventory. Items over 60 days reduced by 25%, over 90 days reduced by 50%, over 120 days reduced by 75% and over 150 days reduced by 100%.\nHOOPS SCOUTING USA\nNotes to the financial statements\nYears ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in U.S. dollars)\n2.

To achieve this core principle, ASC 606 includes provisions within a five-step model that includes identifying the contract with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when, or as, an entity satisfies a performance obligation.\n3.
