    "content": "Item 1. Business.\nOverview\nVerde Resources, Inc. (the We or Company or VRDR) was incorporated on April 22, 2010, in the State of Nevada, U.S.A..\nThe Company currently is engaged in the production and distribution of renewable commodities, distribution of THC-free cannabinoid (CBD) products, and real property holding. However, the Company has been undergoing a restructuring exercise to shift its focus towards renewable energy and sustainable development with the world faced with challenges of climate change and environmental dehydration. The Company had announced the disposition of the mining business through the sale of the entire issued and paid-up share capital of CSB on March 13, 2023. The disposition of CSB was completed on April 20, 2023.\nThe Company conducts business operations in La Belle, Missouri, U.S.A., through Verde Renewables, Inc. (VRI), a company incorporated in the State of Missouri, U.S.A., and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Verde Estates, LLC (VEL), a Missouri limited liability company.\nWe currently operate in the production and distribution of renewable commodities through Verde Resources (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian corporation. We intend to develop operations in the distribution of THC-free cannabinoid products through Verde Life Inc., an Oregon corporation. The Company is also considering investment opportunities in other non-mining areas including the bioenergy industry and the food & beverage sector.\nThe Company took a significant strategic shift by divesting its mining operations in Malaysia to concentrate exclusively on advancing its green and climate-focused initiatives. Our overarching ambition is to emerge as a prominent leader in delivering net-zero solutions while pioneering efforts in decarbonization and regenerative environmental projects. The Company has since undergone a restructuring exercise to focus on renewable energy and sustainability development with the world faced with challenges of climate change and environmental dehydration. The Company is working alongside lawmakers that will assist in shaping future climate bills, where increased standards and beneficial solutions in agriculture can be implemented to help aid with further political legislation towards climate mitigation and adaptation. We will engage key stakeholders to develop licensed and accountable measures that will assist in shaping and defining a sustainable credit exchange for the commercial market.\nThe Company announced a momentous partnership with Green Carbon Industries (GCI), securing exclusive access to their invaluable intellectual property (IP) rights. This collaboration lays the foundation for revolutionary infrastructure development, marked by innovative biochar asphalt showcase projects within the United States. Biochar-asphalt, an innovative, eco-friendly, high performance, and cost-saving alternative to conventional high CO2 footprint asphalt production and installation, holds immense promise in addressing environmental concerns. Through the integration and extensive utilization of biochar - a carbon-rich material derived from organic waste, the Company aims to reduce carbon emissions and the carbon footprint of infrastructure projects. The American showcase projects will serve as compelling evidence of the technologys capability in carbon sequestration, efficiently mitigating greenhouse gas, enhancing durability and cost efficiencies, all while simultaneously addressing pressing environmental challenges.\nPuro.earth, the crediting platform for durable carbon removal, has officially registered the Company as a Carbon Removal Credit supplier as part of its Accelerate program. This partnership was formalized through a platform agreement signed in April 2023. The Companys endeavors are poised to unlock revenue opportunities by generating Carbon Removal Credits (CORCs). This critical step incentivizes the broader adoption of climate technologies and enables the Company to supply these credits to companies seeking to offset their carbon footprint in pursuit of net-zero objectives. Simultaneously, this approach creates an additional and substantial revenue stream for the Company.\nThe following diagram illustrates our current corporate structure:\nCorporate History and Structure\nVerde Resources, Inc. was incorporated on April 22, 2010, in the State of Nevada, U.S.A.\nThe following persons were appointed to serve as Directors and to assume the responsibilities of officers, on October 17, 2013: Mr. Wu Ming Ding, as President and Director; Mr. Balakrishnan B S Muthu as Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer, General Manager and Director; and Mr. Liang Wai Keen as Secretary.\nOn October 25, 2013, we entered into an Assignment Agreement for the Assignment of Management Right in Merapoh Gold Mines in Malaysia (Assignment Agreement) with Federal Mining Resources Limited (FMR), a company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands.\nFMR owned 85% equity interest in CSB, a private limited liability company incorporated in Malaysia. CSB is the Mining Contractor of the Mining Lease for Site IV-1 at the Merapoh Gold Mine under the Contract for Work with MMC Corporation Berhad, the Permit Holder of the Mining Lease.\nUnder the terms of the Assignment Agreement, FMR had assigned its management rights of CSBs mining operation in the Mining Lease to the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Verde Resources Asia Pacific Limited (VRAP) in exchange for 80,000,000 shares of the Companys Common stock, which constituted 95.26% of our issued and outstanding capital stock as of and immediately after the consummation of the acquisition.\nVRAP was formed on February 7, 2013, by the Board of Directors of FMR to monitor the CSB operation. The acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of VRAP was agreed upon on October 18, 2013, and completed on October 25, 2013, subject to the approval of the Board of Directors and the audit of VRAP.\nPursuant to the Assignment Agreement, and a Supplementary Agreement dated February 17, 2014, on further clarifications to the Assignment Agreement signed by the Company with FMR, the 100% interest of FMR in VRAP was transferred to VRDR at a consideration of One and no/100 Dollar ($1.00). This transaction was recorded as a reverse acquisition in accordance with ASC 805-40 Reverse Acquisitions. The legal parent was VRDR, which was the accounting acquiree, while VRAP was the accounting acquirer. There was a 15% non-controlling interest of CSB after the acquisition. This transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein VRAP with its 85% deemed subsidiary CSB was considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets and liabilities of the acquired entity have been brought forward at their book value and no goodwill has been recognized.\nPrior to the acquisition of VRAP, on July 1, 2013, FMR had assigned its rights and obligations pursuant to its 85% interest in CSB to VRAP. According to ASC 810-05-08 A, CSB is a deemed subsidiary of VRAP because due to the assignment, VRAP had gained control of the Board of Directors of CSB, VRAPs rights to receive future benefits and residual value, and VRAPs obligation to absorb losses and provide financing for CSB. VRAP had the power to direct the activities of CSB that most significantly impact CSBs economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of CSB that could potentially be significant to CSB. Accordingly, VRAP was the primary beneficiary of CSB. Under 810-23-42, 43, it was determined that CSB was de-facto agent and VRAP, the principal, and consequently, CSB was considered as a deemed subsidiary of VRAP beginning July 1, 2013.\nWith the above transactions, VRAP became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and CSB, its 85% deemed indirect subsidiary.\nOn April 1, 2014, the Board of Directors of VRAP notified FMR of the decision to exercise its option to purchase an 85% equity interest of CSB pursuant to Section 3.2.4 of the Management Agreement dated July 1, 2013, between VRAP and FMR. This acquisition was completed on April 1, 2014, with consideration of $1, and VRAP then became an 85% shareholder of CSB.\nEffective February 20, 2016, Mr. Wu Ming Ding resigned from his positions as President and Director of the Company, with Mr. Balakrishnan B S Muthu being appointed President to fill the vacancy created. Effective February 20, 2016, Mr. Chen Ching was appointed Director of the Company and the entire Board of Directors then consisted of Mr. Balakrishnan B S Muthu and Mr. Chen Ching.\nEffective February 2, 2018, our Articles of Incorporation were amended to increase the authorized shares of the Company from 250,000,000 shares of Common stock to 10,000,000,000 shares of Common stock. A copy of the Certificate of Amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State. The Form 8-K announcing the increase of the authorized shares of the Company was filed with SEC on February 6, 2018.\nEffective March 31, 2021, Mr. Carl M. Craven was appointed Director of the Company, and the entire Board of Directors then consisted of Mr. Balakrishnan B S Muthu, Mr. Chen Ching and Mr. Carl M. Craven. The Form 8-K announcing the change in officers and directors were filed with SEC on April 1, 2021.\nOn May 10, 2021, the Company announced the Sale and Purchase Agreement (the S&P Agreement) to acquire the assets of biofraction plant and the right to use intellectual property license in Sabah, Malaysia from Borneo Energy Sdn Bhd, in consideration of issuance of 166,666,667 share of the Companys stock at $0.03 per share, valued at $5,000,000. 135,666,667 shares and 31,000,000 shares were issued on May 10, 2021, and July 1, 2021, respectively.

The consideration for the sale of the entire issued and paid-up share capital of CSB shall be satisfied in full by the payment of Malaysia Ringgit MYR 500,000.\nStage of Operation\nThe Company took a significant strategic shift by divesting its mining operations in Malaysia to concentrate exclusively on advancing its green and climate-focused initiatives. Our overarching ambition is to emerge as a prominent leader in delivering net-zero solutions while pioneering efforts in decarbonization and regenerative environmental projects. The Company has since undergone a restructuring exercise to focus on renewable energy and sustainability development with the world faced with challenges of climate change and environmental dehydration. The Company has completed the disposition of the mining business via the sale of the entire issued and paid-up share capital of CSB on April 20, 2023.\nThe Company has diversified into the green industry with its acquisition of Bio Resources Ltd (BRL), the beneficial and/or registered proprietor of the intellectual property known as Catalytic Biofraction Process, which is a slow pyrolysis process using a proprietary catalyst to depolymerise palm biomass wastes (empty fruit bunches or palm kernel shells) in temperature range of 350 degree Celsius to 500 degree Celsius to yield commercially valuable bio products: bio-oil, wood vinegar (pyroligneous acid), biochar and bio-syngas. The intellectual property is a second-generation pyrolysis process where non-food feedstock like the palm biomass wastes is used as feedstock.\nThe Companys BioFraction technology produces high-quality raw biochar using recycled organic biomass from the dairy, palm, and other natural resource industries. The Company also produces activated biochar, which undergoes further processing combined with natural enzymes, minerals, and microbial additives.\nBiochar can be the key component towards rebuilding and enhancing coral life and marine ecosystems throughout coastal regions. The Company will explore developing blue carbon technologies using biochar as an additive within carbon-negative cement mixtures that can be molded into a variety of useful marine structures and environments. We have begun research and development of various biochar cement compound mixtures, such as raw atmospheric injected CO2, precast eco-friendly cement. We will engage international and regional industry experts, institutes and educational communities, focused towards developing a unique line of blue carbon capturing products for coastal aquatic and marine environments.\nThe Company is working alongside lawmakers that will assist in shaping future climate bills, where increased standards and beneficial solutions in agriculture can be implemented to help aid with further political legislation towards climate mitigation and adaptation. We will engage key stakeholders to develop licensed and accountable measures that will assist in shaping and defining a sustainable credit exchange for the commercial market.\nOn August 7, 2023, the Company announced a momentous partnership with Green Carbon Industries (GCI), securing exclusive access to their invaluable intellectual property (IP) rights. This groundbreaking collaboration lays the foundation for revolutionary infrastructure development, marked by innovative biochar asphalt showcase projects within the United States. These projects complement GCIs established successes in the Asia Pacific (APAC), Middle East, and Africa regions. Our shared commitment revolves around validating the concepts feasibility and scalability for carbon sequestration, thereby transforming global infrastructure development, and proactively addressing pressing environmental challenges.\nBiochar-asphalt, an innovative, eco-friendly, high performance, and cost-saving alternative to conventional high CO2 footprint asphalt production and installation, holds immense promise in addressing environmental concerns. Through the integration and extensive utilization of biochar - a carbon-rich material derived from organic waste, the Company aims to reduce carbon emissions and the carbon footprint of infrastructure projects. The American showcase projects will serve as compelling evidence of the technologys capability in carbon sequestration, efficiently mitigating greenhouse gas, enhancing durability and cost efficiencies, all while simultaneously addressing pressing environmental challenges.\nEarlier this year, Puro.earth, the worlds foremost crediting platform for durable carbon removal, officially registered the Company as a Carbon Removal Credit supplier as part of its Accelerate program. This partnership was formalized through a platform agreement signed in April 2023. It is worth noting that Puro.earth was acquired by Nasdaq in June 2021.\nFurthermore, the Companys endeavors are poised to unlock revenue opportunities by generating Carbon Removal Credits (CORCs). This critical step incentivizes the broader adoption of climate technologies and enables the Company to supply these credits to companies seeking to offset their carbon footprint in pursuit of net-zero objectives. Simultaneously, this approach creates an additional and substantial revenue stream for the Company.\nOn August 30, 2023, the Company achieved a significant milestone by conducting the first-ever biochar-asphalt installation in the United States, just outside of Chicago, Illinois. Subsequently, we replicated this success at our own facility in La Belle, Missouri. On September 25, 2023, upon the invitation of the City of Gramercy, located near New Orleans, Louisiana, the Company executed another biochar-asphalt installation. As a testament to our efforts, we have already received several Letters of Intent (LOIs), and we are confident that our transition from mining to climate-tech and the green economy will yield tremendous results for the company in the years ahead.\nApart from the green industry, the Company is also working on a partnership with MRX Technologies, a market leader in commercial extraction systems for cannabis and hemp. The partnership includes an agreement for VRAP to white-label THC-free CBD products from MRX Technologies.\nEmployees\nAs of October 1, 2023, the Company has the following employees:\nSenior Management\nSales and Marketing\nProduction\nInformation System Technology\nAdministration / Finance / HR\nOthers\nTotal\n30 and 8 of our employees are located in Malaysia and the United States, respectively. None of our employees are members of a trade union. We believe that we maintain good relationships with our employees and have not experienced any strikes or shutdowns and have not been involved in any material labor disputes.\nWe are required to contribute to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) under a defined contribution pension plan for all eligible employees in Malaysia between the ages of eighteen and seventy. We are required to contribute a specified percentage of the participants income based on their ages and wage level. The participants are entitled to all of our contributions together with accrued returns regardless of their length of service with the Company.\nThe EPF is a social security institution formed according to the Laws of Malaysia, Employees Provident Fund Act 1991 (Act 452) which provides retirement benefits for members through management of their savings in an efficient and reliable manner. The EPF also provides a convenient framework for employers to meet their statutory and moral obligations to their employees.\nWe intend to hire more staff to assist in the development and execution of our business operations.\nGovernment and Industry Regulations\nWe are subject to regulations relating to labor standards, occupational health and safety, mine safety, general land use, export of minerals and taxation. Many of the regulations require permits or licenses to be obtained and the filing of certain notices, the absence of which or inability to obtain will adversely affect the ability for us to conduct our exploration, development and operation activities. The failure to comply with the regulations and terms of permits and licenses may result in fines or other penalties or in revocation of a permit or license or loss of a prospect.\nMalaysia has not yet enacted regulations specifically for pyrolysis systems. The Company using a pyrolysis system will operate in designated industrial zones and maintain valid operating and trading licenses that may include Environmental Impact Assessments, and inspections by Malaysian government agencies for health & safety such as Bomba.\nInsurance\nInsurance companies in Malaysia offer limited business insurance products. While business interruption insurance is available to a limited extent in Malaysia, we have determined that the risks of interruption, cost of such insurance and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have such insurance. As a result, we could face liability from the interruption of our business as summarized under Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - We do not carry business interruption insurance so we could incur unrecoverable losses if our business is interrupted.\nCorporate Information\nOur corporate and executive office is located at 2 Cityplace Drive, Suite 200, St. Louis, Missouri 63141, telephone number (323) 538 5799.\nReports to Security Holders\nThe public may read and copy any materials filed with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The Company files its reports electronically with the SEC. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other electronic information regarding New Media and filed with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.\nNear-term Requirements For Additional Capital\nWe believe that we will require approximately $2 million over the next 18 months to implement our business plan. For the immediate future, we intend to finance our business expansion efforts through loans and investments from existing shareholders, financial institutions and investors. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Associated with Verde Resources, Inc.\nWe are dependent on certain key personnel and loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMr. Jack Wong, our current principal executive officer, has extensive contacts and experience in the green climate-tech industry in U.S.A., and we are dependent upon his abilities and services to develop and market our business. He is responsible for overseeing all of our day-to-day business operations of our operating company, VRI, and its subsidiary VEL, including the operations and negotiations for the sales of its activated biochar and other bio products. We may not be able to retain the executive officer/manager for any given period of time. The loss of his services could have a material adverse effect upon our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we must attract, recruit and retain a sizeable workforce of technically competent employees in U.S.A. to run our operations. Our ability to effectively implement our proposed business strategies and expand our operations will depend upon the successful recruitment and retention of additional highly skilled and experienced management and other key personnel in U.S.A. If we cannot maintain highly experienced and skilled management teams, our business could fail and you could lose any investment you make in our shares.\nThe COVID-19 and other future pandemics may result in significant deterioration and disruption in national and local economic conditions and record levels of unemployment, which may have a material impact on our business operations.\nThe COVID-19 and future pandemics may create extensive disruptions to the global economy, to businesses, and to the lives of individuals throughout the world. Federal and state governments would have to take actions to contain the spread of the disease, including quarantines, travel bans, closures of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus, and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief. The spread of COVID-19 has decreased substantially but there may be potential risk to the increased spread of new, more transmissible coronavirus variants, the number of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and other future pandemics may increase again. The substantial increase in these infections may cause state and local governments to consider, and in some cases implement, various activity restrictions and containment measures that previously had been lifted. The uncertain future development of the pandemic situations could materially and adversely affect our business operations.\nImpact of current global economic climate has increased uncertainty of our future operations\nImpact of changes in global economic conditions, including inflation, has increased uncertainty of our business operations.\nChanges in global economic conditions, including inflation which resulted in lower consumer confidence, may continue to have negative impact on our business, revenues and earnings. Inflation rates have increased and may continue to rise. Our suppliers may continue to raise prices that we may not be able to pass on to our customers. This may continue to affect our business, including our competitive position, market share, revenues and profit margins.\nImpact of global tensions may increase uncertainty of our future operations.\nThe global tensions arising from the Ukraine-Russian war and Hamas-Israel war may result in disruptions in the broader global economic environment.\nWe are subject to the many risks of doing business internationally, including but not limited to the difficulty of enforcing liabilities in foreign jurisdictions.\nWe are a Nevada corporation and, as such, are subject to the jurisdiction of the State of Nevada and the United States courts for purposes of any lawsuit, action or proceeding by investors. An investor would have the ability to effect service of process in any action against the Company within the United States. In addition, we are registered as a foreign corporation doing business in Malaysia, and as such, are subject to the local laws of Malaysia governing an investors ability to bring actions in foreign courts and enforce liabilities against a foreign private issuer, or any person, based on U.S. federal securities laws.\nInvestors may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in Malaysia based upon U.S. laws, including the federal securities laws or other foreign laws against us or our management.\nSome of our current operations are conducted in Malaysia, and some of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of Malaysia and other foreign countries. All or substantially all of the assets of these persons are located outside the United States and in other foreign countries. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process within the United States or elsewhere outside Malaysia upon these persons. In addition, uncertainty exists as to whether the courts of Malaysia would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or such officers and/or directors predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in Malaysia against us or such persons predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.\nFailure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, we are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent our transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, are not subject to these prohibitions, and therefore may have a competitive advantage over us. Our executive officers and employees have not been subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prior to 2010. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may result in operational changes and expenditures that could significantly impact our\nbusiness.\nThe current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. In recent years, governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures, in part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change. Such initiatives have been pursued with rigor under the current Administration. To the extent that these initiatives lead to the promulgation of new regulations or supervisory guidance applicable to the Company, we would expect to experience increased compliance costs and other compliance-related risks.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nMalaysian companies may not always adopt a Western style of management and financial reporting concepts and practices, which includes strong corporate governance, internal controls and computer, financial and other control systems. In addition, we may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified employees to work in Malaysia. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet Western standards for foreign subsidiaries. As a result, we may experience difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls, which could impact the reliability of our financial statements and prevent us from complying with SEC rules and regulations and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure of managements assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure of our public accounting firms attestation to or report on managements assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our Common Stock.\nOur independent registered auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur audited financial statements included in this report include an explanatory paragraph that indicates that they were prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern. We have suffered recurring net losses, and record an accumulated deficits as of June 30, 2023. These conditions raise substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our plan for continuing as a going concern included improving our profitability, and obtaining additional debt financing, loans from existing directors and shareholders and private placements of capital stock for additional funding to meet our operating needs. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our plans described above or in attracting equity or alternative financing on acceptable terms, or if at all. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nChanges in interest rates could negatively impact our results of operations, stockholders equity (deficit) and fair value of net assets.\nOur investment activities and credit guarantee activities expose us to interest rate and other market risks. Changes in interest rates, up or down, could adversely affect our net interest yield. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, either can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest yield to expand or compress. For example, due to the timing of maturities or rate reset dates on variable-rate instruments, when interest rates rise, our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets. This rate change could cause our net interest yield to compress until the effect of the increase is fully reflected in asset yields. Changes in the slope of the yield curve could also reduce our net interest yield.\nInterest rates can fluctuate for a number of reasons, including changes in the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies, such as the Federal Reserve. Federal Reserve policies directly and indirectly influence the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. The availability of derivative financial instruments (such as options and interest rate and foreign currency swaps) from acceptable counterparties of the types and in the quantities needed could also affect our ability to effectively manage the risks related to our investment funding. Our strategies and efforts to manage our exposures to these risks may not be effective in the future, which could negatively impact our results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nWe may be exposed to risks relating to managements conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting are ineffective.\nWe do not have an independent audit committee and our Board of Directors may be unable to fulfill the functions of such a committee, which may compromise the management of our business. Our Board of Directors functions as our audit committee and is comprised of two directors, none of whom are considered to be independent in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. An independent audit committee plays a crucial role in the corporate governance process, assessment of the Companys processes relating to its risks and control environment, oversight of financial reporting, and evaluation of internal and independent audit processes. The lack of an independent audit committee may prevent the Board of Directors from being independent in its judgments and decisions and its ability to pursue the committees responsibilities, which could compromise the management of our business.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nMalaysian companies may not always adopt a Western style of management and financial reporting concepts and practices, which includes strong corporate governance, internal controls and computer, financial and other control systems. In addition, we may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified employees to work in Malaysia. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet Western standards for foreign subsidiaries. As a result, we may experience difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls, which could impact the reliability of our financial statements and prevent us from complying with SEC rules and regulations and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure of managements assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure of our public accounting firms attestation to or report on managements assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our Common Stock.\nRisks Associated with Our Common Stock\nOur shares are defined as penny stock. The rules imposed on the sale of the shares may affect your ability to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all.\nOur shares are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 jointly with spouse, or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker-dealer must make a suitability determination for each purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement prior to the sale. In addition, the broker-dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to make a market in or trade our Common Stock and may also affect your ability to resell any shares you may purchase.\nMarket for penny stock has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse\nStockholders should be aware that, according to SEC Release No. 34-29093, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include:\nControl of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer;\nManipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases;\nBoiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced salespersons;\nExcessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and,\nThe wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequential investor losses.\nOur management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities. The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price.\nInability and unlikelihood to pay dividends\nTo date, we have not paid, nor do we intend to pay in the foreseeable future, dividends on our Common Stock, even if we become profitable. Earnings, if any, are expected to be used to advance our activities and for general corporate purposes, rather than to make distributions to stockholders. Prospective investors will likely need to rely on an increase in the price of Company stock to profit from his or her investment. There are no guarantees that any market for our common stock will ever develop or that the price of our stock will ever increase.\nSince we are not in a financial position to pay dividends on our common stock and future dividends are not presently being contemplated, investors are advised that return on investment in our common stock is restricted to an appreciation in the share price. The potential or likelihood of an increase in share price is questionable at best. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone. Item 2. Properties.\nOur corporate and executive office is located at 2 Cityplace Drive, Suite 200, St. Louis, Missouri 63141, telephone number (323) 538-5799. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet our current requirements.\nWe own or lease the following real properties:\nLocation\nRent/Own\nMortgage/Lease Terms\nUse\nLa Belle\nOwn #\nNA\nFactory Site\nSt. Louis Missouri\nLease\nNA Corporate Headquarters\nChesterfield, Missouri\nOwn\nNA\nCorporate Housing\nJalan Silam, Sabah Malaysia\nRent\nNA\nFactory Site\n# - Exercised Option to Purchase on September 27, 2022, and accordingly became an owned property. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nNone Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nPursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ( Dodd-Frank Act ), issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States are required to disclose in their periodic and annual reports filed with the SEC information regarding specified health and safety violations, orders and citations, related assessments and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities under the regulation of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The Company did not have any mines in the United States during the year ended June 30, 2023.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information\nOur Common Stock is now quoted on the OTCQB, under the symbol VRDR. Our stock was approved for quotation on the OTCBB on September 26, 2012. However, the Companys Common Stock did not begin active trading until October 2013.\nThe following table sets forth the high and low bid prices for our Common Stock per quarter as reported by the OTCQB for the most recent two (2) fiscal years, based on our fiscal year end June 30, 2023. These prices represent quotations between dealers without adjustment for retail mark-up, markdown or commission, and may not represent actual transactions.\nFiscal Quarter Ended\nHigh\nLow\nJune 30, 2022\n$ 0.20\n$ 0.03\nSeptember 30, 2022\n$ 0.16\n$ 0.10\nDecember 31, 2022\n$ 0.20\n$ 0.09\nMarch 31, 2023\n$ 0.1505\n$ 0.055\nJune 30, 2023\n$ 0.25\n$ 0.071\nSeptember 30, 2023\n$ 0.45\n$ 0.08\nAs of October 2, 2023, we had 125 shareholders of record of our common stock and 1,176,200,278 shares issued and outstanding.\nDividend Policy\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock and have no present intention of paying any dividends on the shares of our Common Stock. Our current policy is to retain earnings, if any, for use in our operations and in the development of our business. Our future dividend policy will be determined from time to time by our board of directors.\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nNone.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities\nWe did not sell any equity securities which were not registered under the Securities Act during the year ended June 30, 2023, that were not otherwise disclosed on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or our current reports on Form 8-K filed during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, except the following transaction.:\nOn April 21, 2023, the Company issued 1,428,571 restricted Common shares for $100,000 at $0.07 per share and 480,768 restricted Common shares for $50,000 at $0.104 per share to one non-US shareholder.\nPurchase of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nWe did not purchase any of our shares of common stock or other securities during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.

We have generated $158,098 and $38,169 revenues for the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and have recorded a gross loss of $80,055 and $107,187 for the year ended June 30, 2023, and 2022.\nCost of revenue\nWe incurred cost of revenue of $238,153 and $145,356 in the production and distribution of renewable commodities during the year ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses comprised mainly of salaries, office costs, legal and professional fees, consultancy fee and travelling expenses. We have incurred $3,216,022 and $1,905,301 in operating expenses through June 30, 2023, and June 30, 2022. Operating expenses increased by 68.8%, or $1,310,721, primarily due to increase of consultancy fee and legal and professional fee for the year ended June 30, 2023.\nInterest expense\nThe Company recorded interest expense of $1,881,807 and $1,948,086 on the promissory notes for the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Lease interest amounted to $36,765 and $1,065 for the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nOther income\nWe have other income of $1,215,689 and $12,104 for the year ended June 30, 2023, and 2022. Other income increased by $1,203,585, primarily due to gain on disposal of a subsidiary of $980,714 and fair value adjustment on convertible promissory notes issued to BOC of $194,865 as disclosed in Note 12 of the financial statements.\nNet loss\nWe recorded a net loss of $3,998,960 and $3,954,414 for the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nPlan of Operation\nExpansion Plans\nThe Company is diversifying into the green industry with its acquisition of Bio Resources Ltd (BRL), the beneficial and/or registered proprietor of the intellectual property known as Catalytic Biofraction Process, which is a slow pyrolysis process using a proprietary catalyst to depolymerise palm biomass wastes (empty fruit bunches or palm kernel shells) in temperature range of 350 degC to 500 degC to yield commercially valuable bio products: bio-oil, wood vinegar (pyroligneous acid), biochar and bio-syngas. The intellectual property is a second-generation pyrolysis process where non-food feedstock like the palm biomass wastes is used as feedstock.\nThe Company announced a momentous partnership with Green Carbon Industries (GCI) in August 2023, securing exclusive access to their invaluable intellectual property (IP) rights. This groundbreaking collaboration lays the foundation for revolutionary infrastructure development, marked by innovative biochar asphalt showcase projects within the United States. These projects complement GCIs established successes in the Asia Pacific (APAC), Middle East, and Africa regions. Our shared commitment revolves around validating the concepts feasibility and scalability for carbon sequestration, thereby transforming global infrastructure development, and proactively addressing pressing environmental challenges.\nBiochar-asphalt, an innovative, eco-friendly, high performance, and cost-saving alternative to conventional high CO2 footprint asphalt production and installation, holds immense promise in addressing environmental concerns. Through the integration and extensive utilization of biochar - a carbon-rich material derived from organic waste, The Company aims to reduce carbon emissions and the carbon footprint of infrastructure projects. The American showcase projects will serve as compelling evidence of the technologys capability in carbon sequestration, efficiently mitigating greenhouse gas, enhancing durability and cost efficiencies, all while simultaneously addressing pressing environmental challenges.\nEarlier this year, Puro.earth, the worlds foremost crediting platform for durable carbon removal, officially registered the Company as a Carbon Removal Credit supplier as part of its Accelerate program. This partnership was formalized through a platform agreement signed in April 2023. It is worth noting that Puro.earth was acquired by Nasdaq in June 2021.\nThe Companys endeavors are poised to unlock revenue opportunities by generating Carbon Removal Credits (CORCs). This critical step incentivizes the broader adoption of climate technologies and enables the Company to supply these credits to companies seeking to offset their carbon footprint in pursuit of net-zero objectives. Simultaneously, this approach creates an additional and substantial revenue stream for the Company.\nApart from the green industry, the Company is also working on a partnership with MRX Technologies, a market leader in commercial extraction systems for cannabis and hemp. The partnership includes an agreement for Verde Resources to white-label THC-free CBD products from MRX Technologies.\nLimited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital\nThere is limited historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays in the exploration of our properties, and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services.\nWe have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from private placements. Cash generated from operations is highly dependent on the sale of our products, which are still under development stage. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $0.2 million as of June 30, 2023, and $0.4 million as of June 30, 2022.\nThe following table provides selected cash flow data about our company for the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022.\nCash Flow Date\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nNet cash used in operating activities\n$ (1,656,896 )\n$ (1,595,961 )\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$ (387,938 )\n$ (1,348,823 )\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n$ 1,628,281\n$ 989,594\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n$ 198,045\n$ 256,485\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n$ (218,508 )\n$ (1,698,705 )\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n$ 418,917\n$ 2,117,622\nCash and cash equivalents at end of year\n$ 200,409\n$ 418,917\nNet Cash Used In Operating Activities.\nCash used in operating activities reflects net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets, gain on disposal of subsidiary, fair value adjustment on convertible promissory notes, and stock-based compensation, and the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in cash used in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2023, as compared to 2022 was primarily due to higher net loss adjusted for non-cash interest expense of promissory notes and the increase of accrued liabilities and other payables and advanced from related parties.\nIn the operation analysis, the net cash used in operating activities increased from $1,595,961 to $1,656,896. The operation loss of $3,998,960 was partially offset by the noncash expenses such as $254,852 in depreciation, $124,688 in amortization, $519,671 in share-based compensation, $1,877,739 in interest expenses on promissory notes, $60,297 in lease interest expense, fair value adjustment on convertible promissory note of $194,865, gain on disposal of subsidiary of $980,714 and $600 from gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment. In the operating assets and liabilities, the net decrease in current assets resulted from an increase of other receivables, deposits and prepayments of $104,470, an increase in inventories held of $13,850 and a decrease in accounts receivables of $7,785. The net increase in current liabilities resulted from $348,913 increase in advances from related parties, $403,259 increase in accrued liabilities and other payables and $75,768 increase in accounts payable, offset by a decrease in advances from director of $12,877. The final result of the cash flow used in operating activities was $1,656,896.\nNet Cash Used In Investing Activities.\nThe net cash used by investing activity of $387,938 resulted from purchase of property, plant and equipment of $497,302, deposit paid for acquisition of subsidiary company of $21,423, offset by proceeds on disposal of property, plant and equipment of $23,000, net cash inflow from disposal of subsidiary company of $106,647 and net cash inflow on acquisition of a subsidiary company of $1,140 for the year ended June 30, 2023.\nNet Cash Provided By Financing Activities.\nThe net cash provided by financing activities of $1,628,281 resulted from proceeds from shares issued of $1,576,280 and net proceeds from drawdown of loans of $191,000, set off partially by repayments to lease liabilities and related interests for the years ended June 30, 2023, of $138,999 and $10,406 respectively.\nThe cash flow situation will not allow for operations in the coming next 12 months by self-generated cash provided from operating activities. The Company needs to increase cash flow supplies with a long-term plan until the Company makes sustainable profits and has a positive cash flow. Otherwise, loans from related parties may be a temporary solution, although we have no written loan agreements. There is no guarantee that we will be able to secure adequate financing. If we fail to secure sufficient funds, our business activities may be curtailed, or we may cease to operate.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nSubstantial Doubt about the Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3, the Company has generated recurring losses and suffered from an accumulated deficit of $10,292,430 as of June 30, 2023. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans with regards to these matters are also described in Note 3 to the financial statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current year audit of the financial statements that were communicated or are required to be communicated to the audit committee, or in their absence, the directors, and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements, and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAssessment for impairment of Intellectual Properties\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the intangible assets acquired from third parties are measured initially at fair value with an infinite live that are not being amortized. The Company annually evaluates the recoverability of the infinite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future discounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such a review indicates that the carrying amount of intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.\nOur key considerations for the determination the fair value of the intangible assets, comprising Intellectual Properties (IP) as a critical audit matter was due to the high degree of judgement involved in the assessment of the assumptions used in deriving the future discounted cash flows as included in the worksheets presented to us to justify their carrying values of the IP. These were assessed by:\ni)\nCritically evaluating managements assessment for their rationale and justification of the assumptions used;\nii)\nDiscussions with the key management and operational personnel of the Company to understand the future plans, their assumptions and expected income to be derived;\nii)\nObtained necessary supporting information and published reports to support the forecast demand and productions and prices used in the worksheets;\nii)\nAscertaining formulas and linkages in the worksheets were properly set up;\niii)\nPerforming stress tests by reducing assumed demand and production to determine impact on cash flows and carrying values.\n/s/ J&S Associate PLT\nCertified Public Accountants\nFirm ID: 6743\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since

Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Companys periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission include, where applicable, disclosures of estimates, assumptions, uncertainties and markets that could affect the financial statements and future operations of the Company.\nIn preparing these consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and revenues and expenses during the years reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\u00b7\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Verde Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions within the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated upon consolidation. The Company accounts for acquisitions in accordance with guidance found in ASC 805, Business Combinations. The guidance requires consideration given, including contingent consideration, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed to be valued at their fair market values at the acquisition date.\n\u00b7\nSegment Reporting\nAccounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 280, Segment Reporting establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments on a basis consistent with the Companys internal organization structure as well as information about geographical areas, business segments and major customers in consolidated financial statements. Currently, the Company operates in four reportable operating segments.\n\u00b7\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nThe Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and cash equivalents and future receivables. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. At times, its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The Companys management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds, and as such, it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited.\nVERDE RESOURCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\n\u00b7\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash in banks, money market funds, and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value. The Company had $200,409 and $418,917 in cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nAt and June 30, 2023, and 2022, cash and cash equivalents consisted of bank deposits and petty cash on hands.\n\u00b7\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are recognized and carried at net realizable value. An allowance for doubtful accounts will be recorded in the period when a loss is probable based on an assessment of specific evidence indicating troubled collection, historical experience, accounts aging, ongoing business relation and other factors. Accounts are written off after exhaustive efforts at collection. If accounts receivable are to be provided for, or written off, they would be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations within operating expenses. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company has no allowance for doubtful accounts, as per managements judgment based on their best knowledge. As of June 30, 2023, and 2022, the longest credit term for certain customers are 60 days.\n\u00b7\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value (net realizable value), cost being determined on a first-in-first-out method. Costs include material, labor and overhead costs. The Company provides inventory allowances based on excess and obsolete inventories determined principally by customer demand.\nAs of June 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company did not record an allowance for obsolete inventories, nor have there been any write-offs.\n\u00b7\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational and after taking into account their estimated residual values:\nExpected useful life\nLand and buildings\n3-27.5 years\nPlant and machinery\n5-10years\nOffice equipment\n3 years\nProject equipment\n5 years\nComputers\n5 years\nMotor vehicles\n5 years\nFurniture and fittings\n5 years\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs, which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets, are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterment which substantially extend the useful life of assets are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income in other income or expenses.\n\u00b7\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets acquired from third parties are measured initially at fair value with an infinite live that are not being amortized. The Company annually evaluates the recoverability of the infinite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future discounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such a review indicates that the carrying amount of intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.\n\u00b7\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nIn accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, all long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment owned and held by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is evaluated by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.\nVERDE RESOURCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\n\u00b7\nRevenue Recognition\nASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606), establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entitys contracts to provide goods or services to customers.\nThe Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfils its obligations under each of its agreements:\n\u2219\nidentify the contract with a customer;\n\u2219\nidentify the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2219\ndetermine the transaction price;\n\u2219\nallocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2219\nrecognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.\nRevenue is recognized when the Company satisfies its performance obligation under the contract by transferring the promised product to its customer that obtains control of the product and collection is reasonably assured. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer. Most of the Companys contracts have a single performance obligation, as the promise to transfer products or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contract and, therefore, not distinct.\nProduct sales\nRevenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of the Companys product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the customer. The Company expenses incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that it would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial.\nRevenues from product sales are recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with the Companys customers.\nProduct revenue reserves, which are classified as a reduction in product revenues, are generally characterized in the following categories: discounts, returns and rebates. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable as the amount is payable to the Companys customer.\nRental income\nRental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the respective lease agreement.\n\u00b7\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. Operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the discount rate for the lease at the commencement date. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable for the operating lease, the Company generally uses an incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date to determine the present value of future lease payments. Operating lease right-of-use (ROU assets) assets represent the Companys right to control the use of an identified asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are generally recognized based on the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nROU assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. ROU assets from operating and finance leases are subject to the impairment guidance in ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, as ROU assets are long-lived nonfinancial assets.\nROU assets are tested for impairment individually or as part of an asset group if the cash flows related to the ROU asset are not independent from the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. An asset group is the unit of accounting for long-lived assets to be held and used, which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities.\nThe Company recognized no impairment of ROU assets as of June 30, 2023, and 2022.\nVERDE RESOURCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\nThe operating lease is included in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as current and non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nLeases that transfer substantially all the rewards and risks of ownership to the lessee, other than legal title, are accounted for as finance leases. Substantially all of the risks or benefits of ownership are deemed to have been transferred if any one of the four criteria is met: (i) transfer of ownership to the lessee at the end of the lease term, (ii) the lease containing a bargain purchase option, (iii) the lease term exceeding 75% of the estimated economic life of the leased asset, (iv) the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeding 90% of the fair value. At the inception of a finance lease, we as the lessee records an asset and an obligation at an amount equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments. The leased asset is amortized over the shorter of the lease term or its estimated useful life if title does not transfer to us, while the leased asset is depreciated in accordance with our depreciation policy if the title is to eventually transfer to us. The periodic rent payments made during the lease term are allocated between a reduction in the obligation and interest element using the effective interest method in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 842.\n\u00b7\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company adopted the ASC Topic 740, Income tax provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Under paragraph 740-10-25-13, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Paragraph 740-10-25-13 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13.\nThe estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.\n\u00b7\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company did not take any uncertain tax positions and had no adjustments to its income tax liabilities or benefits pursuant to the ASC Topic 740 provisions of Section 740-10-25 for the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022.\n\u00b7\nForeign Currencies Translation\nThe Companys reporting currency is the United States dollar (US$) and the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been expressed in United States dollars. The Companys functional currency is the Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) which is a functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which their operations are conducted.\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations.\nFor reporting purposes, in accordance with ASC Topic 830 Translation of Financial Statements, capital accounts of the consolidated financial statements are translated into United States dollars from MYR at their historical exchange rates when the capital transactions occurred. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates as of balance sheet date. Income and expenditures are translated at the average exchange rate of the respective year. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements subsidiaries to the reporting currency are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statements of changes in stockholders equity.\nTranslation of MYR into U.S. dollars has been made at the following exchange rates for the following periods:-\nJune 30, 2023\nJune 30, 2022\nYear-end MYR:US$ exchange rate\n4.66795\n4.40773\nAnnualized average MYR:US$ exchange rate\n4.50684\n4.23181\n\u00b7\nComprehensive Income\nASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income as defined includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. Accumulated other comprehensive income, as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity, consists of changes in unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation. This comprehensive income is not included in the computation of income tax expense or benefit.\nVERDE RESOURCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\n\u00b7\nNon-controlling Interest\nThe Company accounts for noncontrolling interest in accordance with ASC Topic 810-10-45, which requires the Company to present noncontrolling interests as a separate component of total shareholders equity on the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n\u00b7\nNet Loss per Share\nThe Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic income per share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is computed similar to basic income per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.\n\u00b7\nStock Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718-10, Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights are based on estimated fair values. Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period.\nThe Company accounts for non-employee stock-based awards at fair value in accordance with the measurement and recognition criteria of ASC Topic 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees.\n\u00b7\nRetirement Plan Costs\nContributions to retirement plans (which are defined contribution plans) are charged to general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operation as the related employee service are provided.\n\u00b7\nMineral Acquisition and Exploration Costs\nMineral property acquisition and exploration costs are expensed as incurred. When it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, the costs incurred to develop such property are capitalized. Such costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the probable reserves.\n\u00b7\nEnvironmental Expenditures\nThe operations of the Company have been, and may in the future, be affected from time to time in varying degree by changes in environmental regulations, including those for future reclamation and site restoration costs. Both the likelihood of new regulations and their overall effect upon the Company vary greatly and are not predictable. The Companys policy is to meet or, if possible, surpass standards set by relevant legislation by application of technically proven and economically feasible measures.\nEnvironmental expenditures that relate to ongoing environmental and reclamation programs are charged against earnings as incurred or capitalized and amortized depending on their future economic benefits. All of these types of expenditures incurred since inception have been charged against earnings due to the uncertainty of their future recoverability. Estimated future reclamation and site restoration costs, when the ultimate liability is reasonably determinable, are charged against earnings over the estimated remaining life of the related business operation, net of expected recoveries.\n\u00b7\nRelated Parties\nThe Company follows the ASC 850-10, Related Party for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.\nPursuant to section 850-10-20 the related parties include a) affiliates of the Company; b) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of section 825-10-15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and Income-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d) principal owners of the Company; e) management of the Company; f) other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g) other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.\nVERDE RESOURCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\nThe consolidated financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c) the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d) amount due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.\n\u00b7\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company follows the ASC 450-20, Commitments to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Companys consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.\nLoss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Management does not believe, based upon information available at this time that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.\n\u00b7\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and has adopted paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Paragraph 820-10-35-37) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification are described below:\nLevel 1\nQuoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.\nLevel 2\nPricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.\nLevel 3\nPricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.\nFinancial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.\nThe carrying amounts of the Companys financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, loan and fee receivable, prepayments and other receivables, amounts due from related parties, accrued liabilities and other payables, loans payable, amounts due to related parties approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.\nVERDE RESOURCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\n\u00b7\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2023, there have been no new, or existing, recently issued accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance, that impact the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nThe Company has generated recurring losses and suffered from an accumulated deficit of $10,292,430 as of June 30, 2023. The continuation of the Company as a going concern in the next twelve months is dependent upon the Companys success in pursuing additional financing for its operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing sufficient funds to sustain the operations.\nThe ability of the Company to survive is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of its business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings, and related party loans.\nNo assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company.

Control of an underlying asset is conveyed if we obtain the rights to direct the use of and to obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of the underlying asset. Some of our leases include both lease and non-lease components which are accounted for as a single lease component as the Company has elected the practical expedient. Some of the operating lease agreements include variable lease costs, primarily taxes, insurance, common area maintenance or increases in rental costs related to inflation. Substantially all of our equipment leases and some of our real estate leases have terms of less than one year and, as such, are accounted for as short-term leases as we have elected the practical expedient.\nOperating leases are included in the right-of-use lease assets, other current liabilities and long-term lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at each leases commencement date based on the present values of its lease payments over its respective lease term. When a borrowing rate is not explicitly available for a lease, the incremental borrowing rate is used based on information available at the leases commencement date to determine the present value of its lease payments. Operating lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company adopts a 5% as weighted average incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The weighted average remaining life of the lease was 3 years.\nVERDE RESOURCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\nThe table below presents the lease-related assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet.\nAs of June 30,\nAssets\nRight-of-use asset (#1)\n$ 720,000\n$ 720,000\nRight-of-use asset (#2)\n64,910\n-\nTotal RoU assets\n$ 784,910\n$ 720,000\nLess: Amortisation\n(151,801\n)\n(34,286\n)\n633,109\n685,714\nLiabilities\nCurrent:\nOperating lease liabilities\n$ 20,768\n$ -\nFinance lease liabilities\n172,184\n75,224\nNon-current:\nOperating lease liabilities\n29,483\n-\nFinance lease liabilities\n608,455\n97,900\nTotal lease liabilities\n$ 830,890\n$ 173,124\nAs of June 30, 2023, right-of-use assets were $633,109 and lease liabilities were $830,890.\nAs of June 30, 2022, right-of-use assets were $685,714 and lease liabilities were $173,124.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the amortization charge on right-of-use assets was $117,517 and $34,286, respectively.\n(#1) This leasing arrangement for the lease of the Segama factory amounting to $720,000 is for a lease term of seven (7) years and includes an exclusive right and option to purchase the factory site, together with all its right title and interest, for a consideration to be mutually agreed between the parties at any time during the period of two years from the date of the Segama Lease Agreement.

During the financial year, the Company has been undertaking tremendous changes and expansion which rendered the management to re-consider the available of more management talents and professional staff to meet the enlargement in operation under the coming acquisition and expansion move. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to us required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAs of June 30, 2023, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. During the 2022, the Company has been undertaking tremendous enlargement and expansion which rendered the management to re-consider the available of more management talents and professional staff to meet the enlargement in operation during and after the coming acquisition and expansion move. Based on this consideration and that evaluation, the current management concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.\nThe matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, (2) lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (4) management is dominated by three individuals without adequate compensating controls. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive and Financial Officers in connection with the review of our financial statements as of June 30, 2023.\nManagement believes that the material weaknesses set forth above may have an immediate negative effect on our financial results because of our enlargement of operation. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements if the Company were growing substantially after the expansion move was materialized.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. With the participation of our Chief Executive and Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework. Based upon such evaluation, our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on the COSO framework criteria because of the enlargement in operation. The management acknowledged that there is room for further improvement in maintaining effective internal control and shall take steps to implement managements remediation initiatives during and after that expansion, This includes recruiting more management talents and professional staff, committing the entire organization to allocate necessary organizational resources, and cross-functional collaboration focused on strengthening the Companys quality systems and operating culture.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to an exemption for non-accelerated filers from the internal control audit requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nIn order to cure the foregoing material weakness, we have taken or are taking the following remediation measures:\n-\nWe have been working on recruitment of more management talents and professional staff to fill in the gap of shortage of personnel under enlargement of operation during and after this expansion move. With the enlargement of operation, the management needs to re-consider and re-evaluate the entire internal control reporting system and related risk and changes.\n-\nWe have regularly offered our financial personnel trainings on internal control and risk management. Also, we have regularly provided trainings to our financial personnel on U.S. GAAP accounting guidelines. We plan to continue to provide trainings to our financial team and our other relevant personnel on the U.S. GAAP accounting guidelines applicable to our financial reporting requirements.\nWe intend to complete the remediation of the material weaknesses discussed above as soon as practicable, but we can give no assurance that we will be able to do so. Designing and implementing an effective disclosure controls and procedures is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to devote significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that adequately satisfies our reporting obligations. The remedial measures that we have taken and intend to take may not fully address the material weakness that we have identified, and material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures may be identified in the future. Should we discover such conditions, we intend to remediate them as soon as practicable. We are committed to taking appropriate steps for remediation, as needed.\nOfficers Certifications\nAppearing as exhibits to this Annual Report are Certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.

Item 11. Executive Compensation.\nCompensation Philosophy and Objectives\nOur executive compensation philosophy is to create a long-term direct relationship between pay and our performance. Our executive compensation program is designed to provide a balanced total compensation package over the executives career with us. The compensation program objectives are to attract, motivate and retain the qualified executives that help ensure our future success, to provide incentives for increasing our profits by awarding executives when corporate goals are achieved and to align the interests of executives and long-term stockholders. The compensation package of our named executive officers consists of two main elements:\n1.\nbase salary for our executives that is competitive relative to the market, and that reflects individual performance, retention and other relevant considerations; and\n2.\ndiscretionary bonus awards payable in cash or equity and tied to the satisfaction of corporate objectives.\nProcess for Setting Executive Compensation\nUntil such time as we establish a Compensation Committee, our Board is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of our philosophy with respect to the compensation of executives and for monitoring the implementation and results of the compensation philosophy to ensure compensation remains competitive, creates proper incentives to enhance stockholder value and rewards superior performance. We expect to annually review and approve for each named executive officer, and particularly with regard to the Chief Executive Officer, all components of the executives compensation. We process and factors (including individual and corporate performance measures and actual performance versus such measures) used by the Chief Executive Officer to recommend such awards. Additionally, we expect to review and approve the base salary, equity-incentive awards (if any) and any other special or supplemental benefits of the named executive officers.\nThe Chief Executive Officer periodically provides the Board with an evaluation of each named executive officers performance, based on the individual performance goals and objectives developed by the Chief Executive Officer at the beginning of the year, as well as other factors. The Board provides an evaluation for the Chief Executive Officer. These evaluations serve as the bases for bonus recommendations and changes in the compensation arrangements of our named executives.\nOur Compensation Peer Group\nWe currently engage in informal market analysis in evaluating our executive compensation arrangements. As the Company and its businesses mature, we may retain compensation consultants that will assist us in developing a formal benchmark and selecting a compensation peer group of companies similar to us in size or business for the purpose of comparing executive compensation levels.\nProgram Components\nOur executive compensation program consists of the following elements:\nBase Salary\nOur base salary structure is designed to encourage internal growth, attract and retain new talent, and reward strong leadership that will sustain our growth and profitability. The base salary for each named executive officer reflects our past and current operating profits, the named executive officers individual contribution to our success throughout his career, internal pay equity and informal market data regarding comparable positions within similarly situated companies. In determining and setting base salary, the Board considers all of these factors, though it does not assign specific weights to any factor. The Board generally reviews the base salary for each named executive officer on an annual basis. For each of our named executive officers, we review base salary data internally obtained by the Company for comparable executive positions in similarly situated companies to ensure that the base salary rate for each executive is competitive relative to the market.\nDiscretionary Bonus\nThe objectives of our bonus awards are to encourage and reward our employees, including the named executive officers, who contribute to and participate in our success by their ability, industry, leadership, loyalty or exceptional service and to recruit additional executives who will contribute to that success.\nSummary Compensation Table\nThe following summary compensation table sets forth the aggregate compensation we paid or accrued during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 to (i) our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer), (ii) our Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), (iii) our three most highly compensated executive officers other than the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer who were serving as executive officers on June 30, 2022, whose total compensation was in excess of $100,000, and (iv) up to two additional individuals who would have been within the two-other-most-highly compensated but were not serving as executive officers on June 30, 2022.\nSUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE\nName and Principal Position\nYear\nSalary\n($)\nBonus\n($)\nStock Awards\n($)\nOption Awards\n($)\nNon-Equity Incentive\nPlan Compensation ($)\nChange in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings\n($)\nAll Other Compensation ($)\nTotal\n($)\nJack Wong (1)\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, and Director\n264,088\n13,800\n277,888\nBalakrishnan B S Muthu (2)\nTreasurer, Chief Financial Officer, General Manager, and Director\n41,838\n41,838\nPresident, Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer, General Manager, and Director\n60,547\n60,547\nChen Ching (3)\nDirector\nDirector\n24,000\n24,000\nCarl M.

Based on this assessment, we concluded that our policies and practices do not encourage excessive and unnecessary risk taking that would be reasonably likely to have material adverse effect on the Company. The assessment included our cash incentive programs, which awards non-executives with cash bonuses for punctuality. Our compensation programs are substantially identical among business units, corporate functions and global locations (with modifications to comply with local regulations as appropriate). The risk-mitigating factors considered in this assessment included:\n\u00b7\nthe alignment of pay philosophy, peer group companies and compensation amounts relative to local competitive practices to support our business objectives; and\n\u00b7\neffective balance of cash, short- and long-term performance periods, caps on performance-based award schedules and financial metrics with individual factors and Board and management discretion.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nWe do not currently have a compensation committee and, for the year ended June 30, 2023, the compensation, if any, of our executive officers was recommended by our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman and such recommendations were approved by our Board of Directors.

None of our executive officers has served in such capacity in the past 12 months.\nCompensation Committee Report\nOur Board of Directors has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis in this report with management.
