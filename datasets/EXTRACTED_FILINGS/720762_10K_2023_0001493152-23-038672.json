    "content": "Item 1. Business.\nGeneral\nNon-Invasive Monitoring Systems, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company, NIMS, we, us or our) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on July 16, 1980. The Companys offices are located at 4400 Biscayne Boulevard, Miami, Florida, 33137 and its telephone number is (305) 575-4200.\nCompany Overview\nOur primary business previously consisted of research, development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of non-invasive, motorized, whole body periodic acceleration (WBPA) platforms. These therapeutic acceleration platforms are intended as aids to temporarily increase local circulation for temporary relief of minor aches and pains, produce local muscle relaxation and reduce morning stiffness.\nIn May 2019, we effectively discontinued operations. The Company is a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.\nProducts\nWe currently have no inventory and do not have any of our products available for sale. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur future operating results may vary substantially from anticipated results due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. The following discussion highlights some of these factors and the possible impact of these factors on our future results of operations. If any of the following events actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially harmed. In that case, the value of our common stock could decline substantially.\nRisks Relating to Our Business.\nWe have a history of operating losses, we do not expect to become profitable in the near future and absent additional equity or debt financing, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nOur consolidated financial statements for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 were prepared on a going concern basis; however substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of recurring losses and an accumulated deficit. We are not profitable and have been incurring material losses. Our net losses for our fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 were $0.2 million and $0.2 million respectively. As of July 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $28.7 million. The Company had $7,000 of cash at July 31, 2023 and negative working capital of approximately $268,000. Absent additional equity or debt financing, we will be unable to continue as a going concern, and you may lose all your investment in us.\nWe will require additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe will need to raise additional capital in order for us to continue as a going concern. We will need to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, mergers or acquisitions. We do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. We cannot assure you that we could obtain such approval. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our shareholders may experience significant dilution, and debt financing, if available, may require that we agree to covenants that restrict our operations. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our products or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nWe may be exposed to risks relating to managements assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances that these material weaknesses will be effectively remediated, or that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, is designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nFurthermore, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be sufficient to remediate current or prevent future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies from occurring.\nThe internal control procedures over the completeness and accuracy of the general ledger information and the risk assessment process are not formally documented and may not be designed and operate with a level of precision adequate to prevent or detect misstatements.\nRisks Relating to Corporate Governance\nBecause we do not currently have an audit or compensation committee made up of independent directors, shareholders will have to rely on our directors, only one of whom is independent, to perform these functions.\nCurrently, we do not have an independent audit committee. Our one independent director along with the other Directors functions as our audit committee and is comprised of four directors, three of whom are not considered to be independent in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. An independent audit committee plays a crucial role in the corporate governance process, assessment of the Companys processes relating to its risks and control environment, oversight of financial reporting, and evaluation of internal and independent audit processes. The lack of an independent audit committee may prevent the Board of Directors from being independent in its judgments and its ability to pursue the committees responsibilities, this could compromise management of our business.\nWe do not have a functioning compensation committee comprised of independent directors. The Board of Directors performs these functions as a whole. Thus, there is a potential conflict in that board members who are also part of management will participate in discussions concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions.\nRisks Relating to Our Stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not declared and paid cash dividends on our common stock in the past, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain all of our earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future to finance the operation and expansion of our business. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases and you sell your shares.\nBecause our common stock is a penny stock, it may be more difficult for investors to sell shares of our common stock, and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nOur common stock, which trades on the OTC PINK, is a penny stock since, among other things, the stock price is below $5.00 per share, it is not listed on a national securities exchange, and it has not met certain net tangible asset or average revenue requirements. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks must provide purchasers of these stocks with a standardized risk-disclosure document prepared by the SEC. This document provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks involved in investing in the penny-stock market. A broker must also give a purchaser, orally or in writing, bid and offer quotations and information regarding broker and salesperson compensation, make a written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and obtain the purchasers written agreement to the purchase. Broker-dealers must also provide customers that hold penny stock in their accounts with such broker-dealer a monthly statement containing price and market information relating to the penny stock. If a penny stock is sold to an investor in violation of the penny stock rules, the investor may be able to cancel its purchase and get its money back.\nIf applicable, the penny stock rules may make it difficult for investors to sell their shares of our common stock. Because of the rules and restrictions applicable to a penny stock, there is less trading in penny stocks and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected. Also, many brokers choose not to participate in penny stock transactions. Accordingly, investors may not always be able to resell their shares of our common stock publicly at times and prices acceptable to them.\nOur stock price has been volatile and there may not be an active, liquid trading market for our common stock.\nOur stock price has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and may continue to experience volatility in the future. The price of our common stock has ranged between $0.01 and $0.04 for the 52-week period ended July 31, 2023. Many factors, including those described in this report and others, have a significant impact on the price of our common stock. Also, you may not be able to sell your shares at the best market price if trading in our stock in not active or if the volume is low. There is no guarantee that an active trading market for our common stock will be maintained on the OTC PINK or elsewhere.\nOur quarterly results of operations may fluctuate, and these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline. As a result, in some future quarters our financial or operating results may not meet the expectations of potential securities analysts and investors which could result in a decline in the price of our stock.\nShareholders may experience dilution of ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock and our preferred stock.\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present shareholders. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 401,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of 400,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 designated shares of preferred stock with preferences and rights to be determined by our Board of Directors. As of October 30, 2023, there were outstanding 154,810,655 shares of our common stock, 100 shares of our Series B preferred stock and there were no outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock. We may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of our common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock. We may issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise price) below the price at which shares of our common stock are then currently traded on the OTC PINK.  Item 2. Properties.\nOur principal corporate office is located at 4400 Biscayne Blvd., Miami, Florida. We occupy this space from Frost Real Estate Holdings, LLC, which is a company controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost, a member of the Board of Directors and one of our largest beneficial shareholders. We previously leased the approximately 1,800 square feet under a lease agreement, which commenced with a five-year term on January 1, 2008 and expired on December 31, 2012, and then we went on a month-to-month basis and then in February 2016 the office space rent was reduced to $0 per month. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nNone. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket for common stock\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC PINK under the symbol NIMU.OB. The table below sets forth, for the respective periods indicated, the high and low bid prices for the Companys common stock as reported by the OTC PINK. The following bid quotations represent inter-dealer prices, without adjustments for retail mark-ups, mark-downs or commissions and may not necessarily represent actual transactions.\nQuarter Ended High Low\nOctober 31, 2021 $ 0.04 $ 0.02\nJanuary 31, 2022 $ 0.04 $ 0.02\nApril 30, 2022 $ 0.03 $ 0.01\nJuly 31, 2022 $ 0.02 $ 0.01\nOctober 31, 2022 $ 0.02 $ 0.01\nJanuary 31, 2023 $ 0.04 $ 0.01\nApril 30, 2023 $ 0.04 $ 0.02\nJuly 31, 2023 $ 0.03 $ 0.02\nSince our inception, we have not paid any dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate that we will pay dividends in the foreseeable future. At July 31, 2023, we had 1,389 shareholders of record based on information provided by our transfer agent, Equity Stock Transfer. We believe that the actual number of beneficial shareholders is considerably higher. Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\nAs a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include information otherwise required by this item. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains, in addition to historical information, certain forward-looking statements about our expectations, beliefs or intentions regarding, among other things, our business, financial condition, results of operations, strategies or prospects. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results as of the date they are made. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those set forth below as well as those contained in Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law. These forward-looking statements reflect our views only as of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial performance.\nOverview\nWe previously were engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of non-invasive, whole body periodic acceleration (WBPA) therapeutic platforms, which are motorized platforms that move a subject repetitively head to foot. The Company discontinued operations in May 2019, accordingly, certain assets, liabilities and expenses are classified as discontinued operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to income taxes and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. A more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies can be found in Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we believe that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound accounting policies, we cannot guarantee that the results will always be accurate. Since the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment, actual results could differ from such estimates.\nResults of Operations\nWe have discontinued operations in May 2019. The Company is assessing potential mergers and acquisitions.\nYear Ended July 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended July 31, 2022\nGeneral and administrative costs and expenses. General and administrative (G&A) costs and expenses was $169,000 for the year ended July 31, 2023, as compared to $159,000 for the year ended July 31, 2022. This $10,000 net increase was primarily associated with professional fees incurred in the year ended July 31, 2023.\nTotal operating costs and expenses. Total operating costs and expenses from continuing operations was $169,000 for the year ended July 31, 2023, as compared to $159,000 for the year ended July 31, 2022. This $10,000 increase is primarily attributable to G&A noted above.\nInterest expense. Net interest expense was $30,000 for the year ended July 31, 2023, as compared to $14,000 for the year ended July 31, 2022. The interest expense is related to the Promissory Notes described in Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNet loss. Net loss was $199,000 for the year ended July 31, 2023, as compared to $173,000 for the year ended July 31, 2022. This $26,000 increase is primarily attributable to interest expense and professional fees as noted above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur operations have been primarily financed through private sales of our equity securities and notes received from related parties.\nAt July 31, 2023, we had cash of $7,000 and negative working capital of approximately $268,000. We expect that our existing funds will not be sufficient to support our current operations over the next twelve months. No assurance can be given that such additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to sell additional shares of our stock and/or borrow cash could be materially adversely affected by the economic uncertainty in the global equity and credit markets. Current economic conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile, and continued instability in these market conditions may limit our ability to access the capital necessary to fund and grow our business and to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities.\nNet cash used in operating activities decreased to $158,000 for the year ended July 31, 2023 as compared to $190,000 for the year ended July 31, 2022. This $32,000 decrease was principally due to decreases in cash used by accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nOn August 15, 2023, we entered into a Promissory Note in the principal amount of $200,000 with Frost Gamma Investments Trust (the 2023 Frost Gamma Note), a trust controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost, a current director, which beneficially owns in excess of 10% of NIMS common stock. The interest rate payable by NIMS on the 2023 Frost Gamma Note is 11% per annum, payable on the maturity date of July 31, 2025 (the Maturity Date). The 2023 Frost Gamma Note may be prepaid in advance of the Maturity Date without penalty.\nOn September 16, 2022, we entered into two Promissory Notes in the principal amount of $75,000 each with Frost Gamma Investments Trust (the 2022 Frost Gamma Note), a trust controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost, a current director, and with Jane Hsiao, Ph.D., the Companys Chairman and Interim CEO (the 2022 Hsiao Note), both which beneficially own in excess of 10% of NIMS common stock. The interest rate payable by NIMS on the 2022 Frost Gamma Note and 2022 Hsiao Note 2 is 11% per annum, payable on the Maturity Date of July 31, 2025, as amended on August 15, 2023. The 2022 Frost Gamma Note and 2022 Hsiao Note may be prepaid in advance of the Maturity Date without penalty.\nOn October 4, 2021, we entered into two Promissory Notes in the principal amount of $75,000 each with Frost Gamma Investments Trust (the 2021 Frost Gamma Note), a trust controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost, a current director, and with Jane Hsiao, Ph.D., the Companys Chairman and Interim CEO (the 2021 Hsiao Note), both which beneficially own in excess of 10% of NIMS common stock. The interest rate payable by NIMS on the 2021 Frost Gamma Note and 2021 Hsiao Note is 11% per annum, payable on the Maturity Date of July 31, 2025, as amended on August 15, 2023. The 2021 Frost Gamma Note and 2021 Hsiao Note may be prepaid in advance of the Maturity Date without penalty.\nOur plans include assessing potential mergers and acquisitions. We will need to raise additional capital. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nAs a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include the information otherwise required by this item. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 274)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets at July 31, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders Deficit for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nNon-Invasive Monitoring Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has experienced recurring net losses, cash outflows from operating activities and has an accumulated deficit and these conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ EisnerAmper LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2018.\nEISNERAMPER LLP\nFort Lauderdale, FL\nOctober 30, 2023\nNON-INVASIVE MONITORING SYSTEMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash $ 7 $ 15\nPrepaid expenses\nTotal current assets\nTotal assets $ 23 $ 21\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS DEFICIT\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses $ 240 $ 219\nCurrent liabilities - discontinued operations\nTotal current liabilities\nNotes payable - related parties\nAccrued interest - related parties\nTotal liabilities\nCommitments and Contingencies (Note 8)\nShareholders deficit\nSeries B Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share; 100 shares authorized, issued and outstanding; liquidation preference $10 - -\nCommon Stock, par value $0.01 per share; 400,000,000 shares authorized; 154,810,655 shares issued and outstanding as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively 1,548 1,548\nAdditional paid in capital 26,574 26,574\nAccumulated deficit (28,734 ) (28,535 )\nTotal shareholders deficit (612 ) (413 )\nTotal liabilities and shareholders deficit $ 23 $ 21\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nNON-INVASIVE MONITORING SYSTEMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nYears ended July 31, 2023 and 2022\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nOperating costs and expenses\nGeneral and administrative $ 169 $ 159\nTotal operating costs and expenses\nOperating loss (169 ) (159 )\nInterest expense (30 ) (14 )\nNet loss $ (199 ) $ (173 )\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding - basic and diluted $ 154,811 $ 154,811\nBasic and diluted loss per common share $ (0.00 ) $ (0.00 )\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nNON-INVASIVE MONITORING SYSTEMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS DEFICIT\nYears ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 (Dollars in thousands, except share amounts)\nShares Amount Shares Amount Capital Deficit Total\nPreferred Stock\nAdditional\nSeries B Common Stock Paid in Accumulated\nShares Amount Shares Amount Capital Deficit Total\nBalance at July 31, 2021 $ - 154,810,655 $ 1,548 $ 26,574 $ (28,362 ) (240 )\nNet loss - - - - - (173 ) (173 )\nBalance at July 31, 2022 - 154,810,655 1,548 26,574 (28,535 ) $ (413 )\nBalance, value - 154,810,655 1,548 26,574 (28,535 ) $ (413 )\nNet loss - - - - - (199 ) (199 )\nBalance at July 31, 2023 $ - 154,810,655 $ 1,548 $ 26,574 $ (28,734 ) $ (612 )\nBalance, value $ - 154,810,655 $ 1,548 $ 26,574 $ (28,734 ) $ (612 )\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nNON-INVASIVE MONITORING SYSTEMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nYears ended July 31, 2023 and 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nOperating activities\nNet loss $ (199 ) $ (173 )\nAdjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities\nPrepaid expenses (10 ) (2 )\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses (29 )\nAccrued interest - related parties\nNet cash used in operating activities (158 ) (190 )\nFinancing activities\nProceeds from notes payable - related parties\nNet cash provided by financing activities\nNet decrease in cash (8 ) (40 )\nCash, beginning of year\nCash, end of year $ 7 $ 15\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nNON-INVASIVE MONITORING SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS\nOrganization. Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems, Inc., a Florida corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company or NIMS). The Company previously developed and marketed its Exer-Rest\u00ae line of acceleration therapeutic platforms based upon unique, patented whole body periodic acceleration (WBPA) technology of which the Company maintains patents. The Company maintains limited administration, but does not have any operations or inventory.\nBusiness. The Company is currently a shell company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act).\nGoing Concern. The Companys consolidated financial statements have been prepared and presented on a basis assuming it will continue as a going concern. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had net losses from continuing operations of approximately $0.2 million for each of the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 and has experienced cash outflows from operating activities. The Company also has an accumulated deficit of $28.7 million as of July 31, 2023. The Company had $7,000 of cash at July 31, 2023 and negative working capital of approximately $268,000. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nOn August 15, 2023, the Company entered into a Promissory Note in the principal amount of $200,000 with Frost Gamma Investments Trust (the 2023 Frost Gamma Note), a trust controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost, which beneficially owns in excess of 10% of the Companys common stock. The interest rate payable by NIMS on the 2023 Frost Gamma Note is 11% per annum, payable on the maturity date of July 31, 2025 (the Maturity Date). The 2023 Frost Gamma Note may be prepaid in advance of the Maturity Date without penalty.\nThe Company is seeking potential mergers, acquisitions and strategic collaborations. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in this regard, and, if not successful, that it will be able to continue its business activities. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nDiscontinued Operations. On May 3, 2019, the Company exchanged inventory for forgiveness of accrued unpaid rent. The Company has no inventory, no immediate plans to replenish inventory and has no current plans to develop or market new products.\nAccordingly, the Company determined that the assets and liabilities met the discontinued operations criteria in Accounting Standards Codification 205-20-45 and were classified as discontinued operations at May 3, 2019. See Discontinued Operations Note 3.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nConsolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems of Florida, Inc., which has no current operations, and NIMS of Canada, Inc., a Canadian corporation, which has no current operations. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nDiscontinued Operations. For the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, results from operations for our Exer-Rest Business are classified as discontinued operations. The carve out of the discontinued operations (i) were prepared in accordance with the SECs carve out rules under Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) Topic 1B1 and (ii) are derived from identifying and carving out the specific assets, liabilities, operating expenses and interest expense associated with the Exer-Rest Businesss operations (see Note 3).\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions, such as deferred taxes as estimates, that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments purchased with an original maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had approximately $7,000 and $15,000, on deposit in bank operating accounts at July 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively.\nIncome Taxes. The Company uses the asset and liability method to determine the income tax expense or benefit. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to recovered or settled. Any resulting net deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability and, accordingly, a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nThe Company files its tax returns as prescribed by the laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Tax years ranging from 2019 to 2023 remain open to examination by various taxing jurisdictions as the statute of limitations has not expired. The net operating losses are generally subject to examination up to three years after the utilization of such losses. It is the Companys policy to include income tax interest and penalty expense in its tax provision.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of July 31, 2023 and 2022. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments such as cash, prepaid expenses and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair values because they are short term in nature.\nLoss Contingencies. We recognize contingent losses that are both probable and estimable. In this context, we define probability as circumstances under which events are likely to occur. In regard to legal costs, we record such costs as incurred.\nRelated Parties. The Company follows ASC 850 Related Party Disclosures, for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all relevant Accounting Standard Updates (ASUs). Our conclusion was that they did not have any material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nOn May 3, 2019, the Company exchanged its inventory for forgiveness of accrued unpaid rent. Concurrent with the exchange management with the appropriate level of authority determined to discontinue the operations of the product segment.\nThe detail of the consolidated balance sheets for discontinued operations is as stated below (in thousands):\nSCHEDULE OF BALANCE SHEETS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nAs of\nJuly 31, 2023\nAs of\nJuly 31, 2022\nCurrent liabilities - discontinued operations\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses $ 51 $ 51\nTotal current liabilities - discontinued operations\nTotal liabilities - discontinued operations $ 51 $ 51\n4. SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY\nThe Company has one class of Preferred Stock. Holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to vote with the holders of common stock as a single class on all matters. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 401,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of 400,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 designated shares of preferred stock with preferences and rights to be determined by our Board of Directors.\nSeries B Preferred Stock is not redeemable by the Company and has a liquidation value of $100 per share, plus declared and unpaid dividends, if any. Dividends are non-cumulative, and are at the rate of $10 per share, if declared.\nNo preferred stock dividends were declared for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company did not issue any shares of the Companys common stock during the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022.\n5. BASIC AND DILUTED LOSS PER SHARE\nBasic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is computed giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during the period. Diluted potential common shares consist of incremental shares issuable upon conversion of preferred stock. In computing diluted net loss per share for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, no dilution adjustment has been made to the weighted average outstanding common shares because the assumed conversion of preferred stock would be anti-dilutive.\n6. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nDr. Hsiao and directors Dr. Frost and Rao Uppaluri and former director Steve Rubin are each stockholders, current or former officers and/or directors or former directors of Asensus Surgical, Inc. (formerly TransEnterix, Inc.) (Asensus), a publicly-traded medical device company. Dr. Frost is a director and over 5% shareholder of Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. (Cocrystal Pharma), a clinical stage Nasdaq listed biotechnology company. The Companys Chief Financial Officer also serves as the Chief Financial Officer and Co-Chief Executive Officer of Cocrystal Pharma, and in which former director Steve Rubin serves on the Board. From December 2009 until August 31, 2021, the Companys Chief Legal Officer had served under a cost sharing arrangement as the Chief Legal Officer of Asensus. The Company recorded additions to general and administrative costs and expenses to account for the sharing of costs under this arrangement of $0 and $400 for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There was no accounts payable due to Asensus at July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company signed a five year lease for administrative office space in Miami, Florida with a company controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost, a current director and who is the beneficial owner of more than 10% of the Companys common stock. The rental payments under the Miami office lease, which commenced January 1, 2008 and expired on December 31, 2012, were approximately $1,250 per month and then continued on a month-to-month basis. In February 2016 the rent was reduced to $0 per month. For the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not record any rent expense related to the Miami lease. At July 31, 2023 and 2022 there was $0 rent payable.\nThe Company is under common control with multiple entities and the existence of that control could result in operating results or financial position of each individual entity significantly different from those that would have been obtained if the entities were autonomous. One of those related parties, OPKO Health, Inc. (OPKO) and the Company are under common control and OPKO has a one percent ownership interest in the Company that OPKO has accounted for as an equity method investment due to the ability to significantly influence the Company.\n7. NOTES PAYABLE - RELATED PARTY\nOn September 16, 2022, the Company entered into two Promissory Notes in the principal amount of $75,000 each with Frost Gamma Investments Trust (the 2022 Frost Gamma Note), a trust controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost, a current director, and with Jane Hsiao, Ph.D., the Companys Chairman and Interim CEO (the 2022 Hsiao Note), both which beneficially own in excess of 10% of NIMS common stock. The interest rate payable by NIMS on the 2022 Frost Gamma Note and 2022 Hsiao Note is 11% per annum, payable on the Maturity Date of July 31, 2025, as amended on August 15, 2023. The 2022 Frost Gamma Note and 2022 Hsiao Note may be prepaid in advance of the Maturity Date without penalty.\nOn October 4, 2021, the Company entered into two Promissory Notes in the principal amount of $75,000 each with Frost Gamma Investments Trust (the 2021 Frost Gamma Note), a trust controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost, a current director, and with Jane Hsiao, Ph.D., the Companys Chairman and Interim CEO (the 2021 Hsiao Note), both which beneficially own in excess of 10% of NIMS common stock. The interest rate payable by NIMS on the 2021 Frost Gamma Note and 2021 Hsiao Note is 11% per annum, payable on the Maturity Date of July 31, 2025, as amended on August 15, 2023. The 2021 Frost Gamma Note and 2021 Hsiao Note may be prepaid in advance of the Maturity Date without penalty.\n8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLeases.\nThe Company was under an operating lease agreement for our corporate office space that expired in 2012. The lease currently continues on a month to month basis at no cost.\n9. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses from continuing operations are summarized in the following table (in thousands):\nSCHEDULE OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\nAccounts payable $ 209 $ 203\nAccrued redemption\nAccrued other\nTotal $ 240 $ 219\n10. INCOME TAXES\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Pursuant to this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of the Companys assets and liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. A valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe accounting for uncertain tax positions guidance under ASC 740 requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The application of this guidance does not affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company files its tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and with U.S. states. The Company is subject to tax audits in all jurisdictions for which it files tax returns. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. There are currently no tax audits that have commenced with respect to income tax or any other returns in any jurisdiction. Tax years ranging from 2019 to 2023 remain open to examination by various taxing jurisdictions as the statute of limitations has not expired. Because the Company is carrying forward income tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits from 2018 and earlier tax years, these attributes can still be audited when utilized on returns filed in the future. It is the Companys policy to include income tax interest and penalties expense in its tax provision.\nThe difference between income taxes at the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% in 2023 and 2022 and income taxes reported in the consolidated statements of operations are attributable to the following (in thousands):\nSCHEDULE OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE AND INCOME TAXES\nJuly 31, 2023 % July 31, 2022 %\nIncome tax benefit at the federal statutory rate from continuing operations $ (42 ) 21.0 $ (36 ) 21.0\nState income taxes, net of effect of federal taxes (9 ) 4.5 (7 ) 4.3\nExpired net operating losses (182.8 ) (164.3 )\nChange in valuation allowance (313 ) 157.3 (239 ) 139.0\nTotal $ - - $ - -\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets consist of the following (in thousands):\nSCHEDULE OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\nFederal and State net operating loss $ 3,768 $ 4,081\nForeign net operating loss\nOther\nDeferred tax assets gross,total 3,789 4,102\nLess: Valuation allowance (3,789 ) (4,102 )\nNet deferred tax asset $ - $ -\nAt July 31, 2023, the Company had available Federal and State net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $14.8 million and foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $0.1 million which expire in various years beginning in 2023. Net operating loss carry forwards generated in 2019 and later years never expire. However, these net operating losses can only be used to reduce taxable income by 80 percent. The net operating loss carry forwards may be subject to limitation due to change of ownership provisions under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. The Company has not conducted a study to determine if any changes in ownership has occurred or the potential value of such net operating losses if a change occurs.\nA valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. After consideration of all the evidence, both positive and negative, management has determined that a full $3.8 million valuation allowance at July 31, 2023 ($4.1 million at July 31, 2022) was necessary. The valuation allowance decreased by $313,000 and decreased by $239,000 for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company paid no taxes for the years 2022 or 2021.\n11. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn August 15, 2023, the Company entered into a Promissory Note in the principal amount of $200,000 with Frost Gamma Investments Trust (the 2023 Frost Gamma Note), a trust controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost, which beneficially owns in excess of 10% of the Companys common stock. The interest rate payable by NIMS on the 2023 Frost Gamma Note is 11% per annum, payable on the maturity date of July 31, 2025 (the Maturity Date). The 2023 Frost Gamma Note may be prepaid in advance of the Maturity Date without penalty. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nThe Companys management, with the participation of its Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of July 31, 2023. Based upon that evaluation, the Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of that date, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness identified below.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2023, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.\nProcess and procedures - The Company does not employ a sufficient number of individuals to maintain optimal segregation of duties. The internal control procedures over the completeness and accuracy of the general ledger information and the risk assessment process are not formally documented and may not be designed and operate with a level of precision adequate to prevent or detect misstatements. Since internal control procedures are not formally documented, management cannot monitor their effectiveness.\nAccordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Companys internal controls.\nAs a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nNotwithstanding the existence of these material weaknesses in the Companys internal control over financial reporting, the Companys management believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K fairly present in all material respects the Companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the last quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
