    "content": "Item 1. Business\nEstablished on August 25, 2021, OpenLocker Inc. (the Company or OpenLocker) is dedicated to offering marketing solutions for collegiate and professional sports organizations and athletes to deepen fan engagement through innovative collectibles, membership rewards, exclusive events and experiences.\nThe OpenLocker mission is to empower athletes by monetizing their Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) with autographed collectibles, meaningful fan experiences and partnerships with local merchants, regional and national brands.\nOpenLocker launched its first fan community at the University of Connecticut in February 2022, during the first season following the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) policy change allowing student-athletes to receive compensation for their NIL. The Company deliberately included all 14 eligible members of the mens basketball team to galvanize the fan base and name the fan community the Bone Yard Huskyz Club (BYHC). The OpenLocker design team created the BYHC logo and Huskyz avatar to play off of the universitys Huskies mascot and to have an edgy feel. A Huskyz avatar was created in the likeness of each of the athletes and selected super fans for branding and awareness campaigns. A website with a project roadmap outlining the perks and rewards of club membership was activated two weeks prior to the release date, which was strategically timed around the basketball teams season schedule. A comprehensive marketing campaign included digital programmatic advertising, organic and paid social media strategy (including pre- and post-drop Twitter spaces conversations with fans, blockchain experts, athletes and parents of athletes), podcasts, email blasts and gorilla marketing at several home basketball games. The OpenLocker athlete liaison also provided the athletes with graphics and talking points they could use to leverage their social media followings and promote sales of their collectibles by word-of-mouth.\nOpenLocker initially sold digital collectibles, also known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), due to the popularity at the time and advantages that blockchain technology offered for authenticating collectibles and providing utility and rewards to UConn fans. OpenLocker minted the NFTs on the FLOW blockchain and sold them on its e-commerce platform for fiat currency to appeal to an audience unfamiliar with cryptocurrency. A majority of the revenue from the BYHC project was generated on the first day of sales. The first two hours were the busiest as fans were incentivized by the free autographed Platinum card that was included with purchase for the first 25 digital collectibles sold per athlete. This unique collectible is a metal, wallet-sized card hand-signed by the athlete with the digital art printed on the front and quick response (QR) code that directs to the boneyardhuskyzclub.com. Customer behavior and feedback confirmed that the physical collectible was deemed to be of greater value to the majority of fans, who had little to no experience with blockchain technology. Since then, OpenLocker has directed its efforts to marketing and selling autographed physical collectibles along with community membership rewards programs, events and experiences.\nFollowing the success of its college fan community model, OpenLocker launched the OpenStable marketplace in April 2022 to engage the next generation of thoroughbred racing enthusiasts. Through its relationships with owners, trainers and influencers in the racing industry, OpenStable aimed to give fans access to exclusive information, real life experiences, and memorabilia so that they could engage in a truly immersive journey covering a racehorses career. By offering both autographed physical collectibles and ownership of digital collectibles which unlocked rewards and experiences, both in the virtual and physical realms, OpenStable was intended to attract a younger audience with a goal to develop the next generation of thoroughbred racing fans.\nThe Company continued to include digital collectibles with the purchase of a physical collectible featuring student-athlete NIL in the following NCAA athletic season so it would have the option to use blockchain technology to verify ownership for its fan loyalty programs. However, the Company has discontinued sale and distribution of digital collectibles, including NFTs, as there was little interest evidenced by the fact that so few customers actually completed the steps required to view and claim them to a personal digital wallet. The OpenLocker NFT viewer remains accessible so that existing owners may continue to have access to their digital collectibles while the Company focuses on delivering physical collectibles and enhancing the fan experience by removing barriers to fan engagement.\nIn addition, from April 2022 through September 2022, Openlocker offered a secondary marketplace for peer-to-peer transactions of digital collectibles, however, no secondary sales were effectuated or attempted and as of September 2022 this secondary marketplace was discontinued. Although, OpenLocker no longer operates a trading platform, owners of issued digital collectibles may transfer their digital collectible to their personal digital wallet and thereafter transfer such digital collectible to the wallet of their choice.\nAs of November 1, 2023, OpenLocker has active fan communities at University of Florida (Gataverse), Florida Atlantic University (PowerOwls Club) and Radford University (RowdyRedz) and is focusing on building club membership rewards programs. While OpenLocker pays athletes a majority of revenue generated from sales of collectibles containing their NIL and compensating them for social media activities and appearances, the Company retains all revenue from sales of community-branded collectibles which do not use athlete NIL nor the marks and logos of any institution. By partnering with local businesses as well as regional and national brands who can offer perks and rewards to community members, OpenLocker is able to create demand and further engage fans and the local community.\nIn addition to supporting the athletes, for each fan community, holders of issued digital collectibles and/or authenticated physical collectibles are entitled to participate in any club membership activities, perks or benefits which the Company may offer or arrange from time to time. Such perks or benefits may include, for example, access to community events (such as meet and greet with athletes), giveaways, and rewards based on an athletes performance.\nOpenLocker is also in discussions with NIL collectives, communities focused on raising funds for school-specific NIL fundraising efforts, that are interested in offering membership rewards programs to their target audiences.\nThe Company is also in discussions with national brands who are interested in leveraging their relationships with student-athletes to create social media influencer campaigns and build customer loyalty programs.\nOpenLockers current revenue model includes (i) sales on the OpenLocker platform, (ii) sponsorship and advertising, and (iii) service fees for creative design work, development and product fulfillment services.\nOpenLocker believes that it has found a unique and attractive market for autographed collectibles and community rewards programs by focusing on the college athlete market, as we believe that interest in college sports is growing.\nPrincipal Products and Services\nOpenLocker aims to provide a comprehensive suite of collectibles, products and services, adopting a hybrid flexible model creating products both licensed and non-licensed with colleges, professional sports teams, leagues, brands, etc.\nAutographed Physical Collectibles (Authenticated Physical Collectibles)\nThe Platinum Card by OpenLocker is a metal, wallet-sized card that has the digital art print sublimated on one side and a QR code printed on the other side which directs to the fan community online portal. The serial number is laser engraved on the card and there is space reserved for the athlete to hand-sign.\nThe Company also offers autographed collectibles made of PVC plastic that is even more durable, making it a preferable material to carry around.\nThe Platinum Card entitles the holder to receive any perks or benefits that may be offered by OpenLocker and its brand partners.\nGear\nOpenLocker also sells exclusive gear, including t-shirts, sweatshirts, hats and pins, in its exclusive gear shops.\nOpenLocker Marketplace\nThe OpenLocker Marketplace provides a user-friendly shopping experience for sports fans to purchase membership cards, gear and collectibles featuring their favorite athletes for access to exclusive perks and rewards.\nSports Branding Services\nOpenLocker also provides branding services for individual athletes, university collectives, horse owners/trainers, and other entities interested in creating a distinctive identity, building their fan base, and maximizing revenue. From logo creation and styling to social media messaging and activation campaigns, OpenLockers team can provide enhanced support to collaborating colleges and athletes.\nIndustry Overview and Market Opportunity\nOur business model has been enabled by the recent change in NCAA policy, effective July 1, 2021, which now allows college athletes to profit from their NIL. A majority of the general public and close to three quarters of college sports fans believe that athletes should be compensated for their NIL, with stronger support among those between the ages of 18 and 34.\nNIL merchandise sales, including apparel, autographed balls and posters, have expanded in the second year since the NCAA policy change with the increase in awareness and demand for NIL products. By connecting exclusive rewards and perks to its autographed collectibles featuring student athlete NIL at University of Florida, Florida Atlantic University and Radford University, OpenLocker offers tangible benefits and strengthens community relationships in the long-term. The company also creates opportunities for local businesses and national brands to benefit from NIL through influence marketing, partnerships and appearances.\nCompetitive Advantage\nTactical Objective\nOpenLockers user-friendly platform empowers athletes to monetize their fan engagement with innovative collectibles. In addition to designing, marketing and selling physical autographed collectibles with the athletes NIL, OpenLocker also invests in helping athletes build their digital currency with branding support services and integrated marketing strategies. OpenLocker facilitates the distribution of autographed collectibles, gear and any memorabilia that athletes wish to deliver to fans, along with experiences or appearances agreed to by the athlete.\nThe release of each fan communitys collection is designed to target an athletes, group of athletes or teams fan base which includes students, alumni, university staff plus friends & family members of the athletes. A combination of organic and paid social media campaigns, public relations, advertising and campus activation strategies are used to drive sales. Scheduling drops around peak interest and special events is also critical to maximize the impact of sales and marketing efforts, the most effective times being just prior to the start of a season.\nCollege Network\nThe OpenLocker Business Development team leverages its relationships with college coaches and athletic departments to explore potential partnerships, school licensing opportunities and gain direct access to athletes. The company has a track record of fairly compensating student-athletes which has translated into trusting relationships and seamless onboarding.\nCommunity Rewards Programs\nOpenLocker differentiates itself by offering rewards to fans for supporting their favorite student-athletes through purchase of an athletes autographed collectible. The company aims to remove barriers and strengthen community ties through business partnerships that leverage NIL in creative ways. One way that OpenLocker enables small businesses to benefit from NIL is to offer rewards for athlete performance. At the University of Florida, fans who purchase an autograph collectible featuring the NIL of Trevor Etienne, the Florida Gators running back, receive 20% off at Etiennes favorite chicken wing restaurant in Gainesville. Fans with the card also get a free meal when Trevor Etienne scores two touchdowns in a single game. This is just one example of OpenLockers strategy for attracting more fans to its platform and connecting fans and athletes in deeper, more meaningful ways.\nCustomers\nOpenLockers customers include fans of college sports teams and athletes including students, alumni, parents and friends of the athletes. The company aims to expand its reach to a broader network of college sports spectators who are not as familiar with NIL with its fan rewards programs that offer perks and experiences for community membership.\nOur customers also include brands who are interested in leveraging their relationships with student-athletes to create social media influencer campaigns and build customer loyalty programs.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur anticipated business activities are not currently subject to any particular regulation by government agencies other than those routinely imposed on corporate and/or publicly traded businesses.\nNotwithstanding the above, we have in the past sold digital assets and made a secondary marketplace available for those digital assets, as described herein. As digital assets have grown in both popularity and market size, the U.S. Congress and a number of U.S. federal and state agencies (including FinCEN, SEC, CFTC, FINRA, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the IRS and state financial institution regulators) have been examining the operations of digital asset networks, digital asset users and the digital asset exchange markets, with particular focus on the extent to which digital assets can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities or fund criminal or terrorist enterprises and the safety and soundness of exchanges or other service-providers that hold digital assets for users. Many of these state and federal agencies have issued consumer advisories regarding the risks posed by digital assets to investors. In addition, federal and state agencies, and other countries, have issued rules or guidance about the treatment of digital asset transactions or requirements for businesses engaged in digital asset activity.\nLaw enforcement agencies have often relied on the transparency of blockchains to facilitate investigations. Europol, the European Unions law enforcement agency, released a report in October 2017 noting the increased use of privacy-enhancing digital assets like Zcash and Monero in criminal activity on the internet and in May 2018 it was reported that Japans Financial Service Agency has been pressuring Japanese digital asset exchanges to delist privacy-enhancing digital assets. Although no regulatory action has been taken to treat Zcash or other privacy-enhancing digital assets differently, this may change in the future.\nVarious foreign jurisdictions have, and may continue to, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect the digital asset markets and their users, particularly digital assets and their service providers that fall within such jurisdictions regulatory scope. For example, on March 5, 2020, South Korea voted to amend its Financial Information Act to require virtual asset service providers to register and comply with its AML and CFT framework. These measures also provide the government with the authority to close digital asset exchanges that do not comply with specified processes. The Chinese and South Korean governments have also banned ICOs and there are reports that Chinese regulators have taken action to shut down a number of China-based digital asset exchanges. Further, on January 19, 2018, a Chinese news organization reported that the Peoples Bank of China had ordered financial institutions to stop providing banking or funding to any activity related to cryptocurrencies. Similarly, in April 2018, the Reserve Bank of India banned the entities it regulates from providing services to any individuals or business entities dealing with or settling digital assets. On March 5, 2020, this ban was overturned in the Indian Supreme Court, although the Reserve Bank of India is currently challenging this ruling. There remains significant uncertainty regarding the South Korean, Indian and Chinese governments future actions with respect to the regulation of digital assets and digital asset exchanges. Such laws, regulations or directives may conflict with those of the United States and may negatively impact the acceptance of digital assets by users, merchants and service providers outside the United States and may therefore impede the growth or sustainability of the digital asset economy in the European Union, China, Japan, Russia and the United States and globally, or otherwise negatively affect the value of digital assets.\nSecurities Act of 1933\nUnder the U.S. Securities laws, a digital asset may be considered a security as defined in Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act). In determining whether a particular digital asset is a security, it is generally accepted to apply the standards set forth in the U.S. Supreme Court case of SEC v. W. J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946). Our Company does not hold or invest in digital assets, including, but not limited to, NFTs.\nTo the extent any digital asset we sold could be deemed a security, we may become subject to additional regulatory requirements, including under the Securities Act. For example, typically, offerings of securities in the United States are required to register under the Securities Act with the SEC and, in compliance with state law, with applicable state regulators, and to the extent any digital assets we invest in was originally distributed in connection with an illegal securities offering, those assets may lose value. In addition, our plans to sell digital assets may be substantially constrained or prohibited with respect to transactions if determined to be a security. We may need to find a suitable exemption from registration for these sales. At this time, we do not have a present intent to offer digital assets, including, but not limited to, NFTs, in the future.\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934\nIn the event we invest in the securities of a company that is subject to the reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we may be required to make certain filings with the SEC in connection with any acquisition or beneficial ownership of more than 5% of any class of the equity securities of a company registered under the Exchange Act. Generally, these filings require disclosure of the identity and background of the purchaser, the source and amount of funds used to acquire the securities, the purpose of the transaction, the purchasers interest in the securities, and any contracts, arrangements or undertakings regarding the securities. Also, if we become the beneficial owner of more than 10% of any class of the equity securities of a company registered under the Exchange Act, we may be subject to certain additional reporting requirements and to liability for short-swing profits under Section 16 of the Exchange Act.\nGovernment Regulation-OpenLocker\nWe are subject to an extensive and highly-evolving regulatory landscape, and any adverse changes to, or our failure to comply with, any laws and regulations could adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition. We are also subject to governmental regulations routinely imposed on corporate and/or publicly traded businesses.\nBlockchain and digital assets are increasingly becoming subject to governmental regulation, both in the U.S. and internationally. The technology underlying blockchain technology is affected by a number of industry-wide challenges and risks relating to consumer acceptance of blockchain technology, including but not limited to government and quasi-government regulation of NFTs and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of blockchain networks or similar systems, the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of blockchain networks, changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences, the extent to which current interest in NFTs represents a speculative bubble.\nDigital assets have grown in both popularity and market size, the U.S. Congress and a number of U.S. federal and state agencies including FinCEN, SEC, CFTC, FINRA, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the IRS and state financial institution regulators have each been examining the operations of digital asset networks, digital asset users and the digital asset exchange markets. Particular focus has been given on the extent to which digital assets can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities or fund criminal or terrorist enterprises, as well as the safety and soundness of exchanges or other service providers that hold digital assets for users.\nMany federal and state agencies have issued advisories and general public inquiries regarding the risks posed by digital assets, crypto currencies and solutions. In addition, federal and state agencies, and other countries have issued rules or guidance about the treatment of digital asset transactions or requirements for businesses engaged in digital asset activity, both at a Know Your Customer and at Know Your Transaction levels.\nAs discussed above, the SEC, U.S. state securities regulators and several foreign governments have issued warnings that digital assets sold in ICOs may be classified as securities and that both those digital assets and ICOs may be subject to securities regulations. Our anticipated business activities, however, do not involve any ICOs nor any fractionalized digital asset offerings. We currently do not offer or sell any digital assets, including but not limited to, NFTs, and have no immediate plans to do so again.\nIntellectual Property\nTrademarks\nOpenLocker is a registered trademark, and LOCKERMANIA, BONE YARD HUSKYZ CLUB, ROWDY REDZ, POWEROWLS CLUB, GATORVERSE, LIONZ CLUB, OPENSTABLE and MADDY BADDYZ are trademarks of, OpenLocker Holdings, Inc., filed in the category of online advertising and marketing services in the field of sports and NFTs, as well as promoting the sale of goods and services of others by means of contests and incentive award programs; as well as promoting the sale of goods and services of others by OpenLocker.\nPatents\nWhile OpenLocker has developed proprietary technology, as defined under Proprietary Marketplace & Platform, OpenLocker has not registered any patents with the United States Patent & Trademark Office.\nEmployees\nAs of November 1, 2023, we have no full-time employees.

It changed its domicile to Massachusetts in 1987. Until July 7, 1992, the Company was engaged in the sale of an automated luminometer and an accompanying reagent system that measures raw material for microbiological contamination. The Company discontinued operations and liquidated the remaining inventory of reagents on April 16, 1993. The Company changed its state of domicile again to Delaware in May 1996 and concurrently changed its name to IMSCO Technologies, Inc. At the time, the Company switched its focus to developing technology that achieves molecular separation with innovative applications of electrostatics. The Company ultimately abandoned these endeavors and continued to go through shifts in its business operations. In 2001, the Company changed its name to Global Sports and Entertainment, Inc. In 2002, it changed its name to GWIN, Inc. The Company changed its name to Winning Edge International, Inc. in 2006 and in 2007, to W Technologies, Inc.\nIn June 2021, the Company closed upon a share exchange agreement with Krypto Ventures pivoting the Company into the blockchain technology and digital asset business. In November 2021, the Company redeemed a large portion of the common stock issued in the Krypto Ventures transaction and current management took over the Company operations. Effective December 31, 2021, the Company changed its name to Descrypto Holdings, Inc.\nOn December 5, 2022, the Company changed its corporate name to OpenLocker Holdings, Inc. and effective December 9, 2022, the trading symbol for the Companys common stock changed to OLKR. In October 2022 the Company uplisted to the OTCQB Venture Market.\nThrough the acquisition of OpenLocker, the Company is offering marketing solutions for collegiate and professional sports organizations and athletes to deepen fan engagement through innovative collectibles, membership rewards, exclusive events and experiences.\nSeries A Preferred Stock\nOn January 10, 2022, the Company filed a Certificate of Designations of Preferences and Rights of Series A Preferred Stock with the Delaware Secretary of State, authorizing 200,000 shares of Series A preferred stock (the Series A Preferred).

The Series A Preferred will participate in any dividends, distributions or payments to the holders of the common stock on an as-converted basis. Series A Preferred is not entitled to receive any distribution of the Companys assets or surplus funds upon a liquidation, merger or similar event.\nOn January 13, 2022, the Company entered into and closed upon a Share Exchange Agreement by and between the Company and American Capital Ventures, an entity wholly owned by our CEO, Howard Gostfrand (the ACV Agreement).

Such limited operating history may not provide an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations.\nOpenLocker was incorporated in Delaware on August 25, 2021. We have limited experience and a limited operating history in which to assess our future prospects as a company. In addition, the market for our products and services is highly competitive. If we fail to successfully develop and offer our products and services in an increasingly competitive market, we may not be able to capture the growth opportunities associated with them or recover our development and marketing costs, and our future results of operations and growth strategies could be adversely affected. Our limited history may not provide a meaningful basis for investors to evaluate our business, financial performance, and prospects.\nWe may fail to successfully execute our business plan.\nOur stockholders may lose their entire investment if we fail to execute our business plan. Our prospects must be considered in light of the following risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, competition, the erosion of ongoing revenue streams, the ability to retain experienced personnel and general economic conditions. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in executing our business plan. If we fail to successfully execute our business plan, we may be forced to cease operations, in which case our stockholders may lose their entire investment.\nSince inception, we have experienced losses, and may have to further reduce our costs by curtailing future operations to continue as a business.\nSince the original incorporation of OpenLocker on August 25, 2021, it has experienced operating losses. We have also experienced operating losses and in the last several years, prior to the acquisition of OpenLocker, have had no revenues. Our cash flow may be inadequate to support our ongoing operations. Our ability to fund our capital requirements out of our available cash and cash generated from our operations depends on a number of factors, including our ability to gain interest in our products and services and continue growing our existing operations and our ability to raise funds as needed. If we cannot generate positive cash flow from operations, we will have to reduce our costs and try to raise working capital from other sources. These measures could materially and adversely affect our ability to execute our operations and expand our business.\nOur auditors have indicated that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur auditors have indicated that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We had a loss from operations of $2,549,810 for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. The Companys ability to continue as a going concern ultimately is dependent on the managements ability to obtain equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies, and achieve profitable operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of public or private offerings. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for our Company to continue as a going concern. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate revenues and in our ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect or the timeframe in which it may occur. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to further implement our business plan and generate revenues. For further discussion about our ability to continue as a going concern and our plan for future liquidity, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe may suffer from lack of availability of additional funds.\nWe expect to have ongoing needs for working capital in order to fund operations and to continue to expand our operations. To that end, we will be required to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing additional capital on favorable terms, if at all. If we are successful, whether the terms are favorable or unfavorable, there is a potential that we will fail to comply with the terms of such financing, which could result in severe liability for us. If we are unsuccessful, we may need to (a) initiate cost reductions; (b) forego business development opportunities; (c) seek extensions of time to fund liabilities, or (d) seek protection from creditors. In addition, any future sale of our equity securities would dilute the ownership and control of your shares and could be at prices substantially below prices at which our shares currently trade. Our inability to raise capital could require us to significantly curtail or terminate our operations altogether. We may seek to increase our cash reserves through the sale of additional equity or debt securities. The sale of convertible debt securities or additional equity securities could result in additional and potentially substantial dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations and liquidity. In addition, our ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms is subject to a variety of uncertainties.\nIn addition, if we are unable to generate adequate cash from operations, and if we are unable to find sources of funding, it may be necessary for us to sell all or a portion of our assets, enter into a business combination, or reduce or eliminate operations. These possibilities, to the extent available, may be on terms that result in significant dilution to our shareholders or that result in our shareholders losing all of their investment in our Company.\nOur management teams attention may be diverted by acquisitions and searches for new acquisition targets, and our business and operations may suffer adverse consequences as a result.\nMergers and acquisitions are time intensive, requiring significant commitment of our management teams focus and resources. If our management team spends too much time focused on acquisitions or on potential acquisition targets, the management team may not have sufficient time to focus on its existing business and operations. This diversion of attention could have material and adverse consequences on our operations and its ability to be profitable.\nWe may be unable to scale our operations successfully.\nOur growth strategy will place significant demands on our management and financial, administrative and other resources. Operating results will depend substantially on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our financial, administrative and other resources. If OpenLocker is unable to respond to and manage changing business conditions, or the scale of its operations, then the quality of its services, its ability to retain key personnel, and its business could be harmed.\nEconomic conditions or changing consumer preferences could adversely impact our business.\nA downturn in economic conditions in one or more of our markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects. Any sustained failure to identify and respond to trends could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects.\nThe requirements of remaining a public company may strain our resources and distract management, which could make it difficult to manage our business.\nWe are required to comply with various regulatory and reporting requirements, including those required by the SEC. Complying with these reporting and other regulatory requirements are time-consuming and expensive and could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) including maintaining internal controls over financial reporting, and if we fail to continue to comply, our business could be harmed, and the price of our securities could decline.\nCurrently, our Presidents law firm is providing legal services necessary to maintain our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act without charge. If our President were to leave or otherwise cease providing these services without charge, we could incur significant additional expenses which could harm our business.\nWe rely on technology, such as our information systems, to conduct our business. Failure to protect our technology against breakdowns and security breaches could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on technology, such as our own information systems, vendors information systems and third-party application programming interfaces (APIs), to conduct our business. This technology is vulnerable to service interruptions and security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, partners and vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including organized criminal groups, hacktivists, identity thieves, nation states and others. The techniques used to breach security safeguards evolve rapidly, and they may be difficult to detect for an extended period of time, and the measures we take to safeguard our technology may not adequately prevent such incidents.\nWhile we have taken steps to protect our confidential and personal information and invested in information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches in our systems or the unauthorized or inadvertent wrongful use or disclosure of confidential information. Such incidents could adversely affect our business operations, reputation, and client relationships. Any such breach would require us to expend significant resources to mitigate the breach of security and to address matters related to any such breach, including the payment of fines. We also may be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived personal data breach as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods.\nAny actual or perceived failure of our platform to block malware or prevent failures or security breaches or incidents could harm our reputation, cause the platform to be perceived as insecure, underperforming, or unreliable, impede our efforts to attract and retain customers, and otherwise negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face security threats from malicious third parties that could obtain unauthorized access to our internal systems, networks and data. Computer malware, viruses and computer hacking, fraudulent use, social engineering (including spear phishing attacks) and general hacking have become more prevalent, and such incidents or incident attempts have been initiated against our customers in the past and may occur against our customers in the future. We may become the target of cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our customers confidential data, which could disrupt our ability to provide some or all of the services on the platform or lead to exposure of customer information. Additionally, we use certain third-party service providers to store and process data on our behalf, and they face a variety of security risks. We have taken steps to protect customer information that might pass through our platform. However, our security measures or those of our third-party service providers could be breached or we could suffer data loss or unauthorized access to, or use of, our platform or the systems or networks used in our business.\nIt is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate the risk of these security threats, and the security, performance, and reliability of our platform may be disrupted by third parties, including competitors, hackers, disgruntled employees, former employees, or contractors. Certain kinds of viruses or malware can corrupt basic functionalities of device operating systems to allow hackers to access or misdirect our customers digital assets.\nWe also process, store and transmit our own data as part of our business and operations. This data may include personally identifiable, confidential or proprietary information, and we use third-party service providers to store and process certain data for us. There can be no assurance that any security measures that we or our third-party service providers have implemented will be effective against current or future security threats. While we take steps in an effort to protect the security of our platform and the availability, integrity, confidentiality and security of our data, our security measures or those of our third-party providers could fail and result in unauthorized access to or use of our platform or unauthorized, accidental or unlawful access to, or disclosure, modification, misuse, loss or destruction of, our or our customers data.\nWhether or not accurate, a market perception that our platform is insecure, underperforming or unreliable could result in:\n\u25cf A loss of existing or potential customers or third-party relationships;\n\u25cf Harm to our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u25cf Delay or inability to attain market acceptance of our platform;\n\u25cf Expenditure of significant financial resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, remediate, or work around errors or defects, to address and eliminate vulnerabilities, and to address any applicable legal or contractual obligations relating to any actual or perceived security breach or incident;\n\u25cf Negative publicity and damage to our reputation and brand; and\n\u25cf Legal claims and demands (including for stolen assets or information, repair of system damages, and compensation to customers), litigation, regulatory audits, proceedings or investigations, and other liabilities.\nAny actual or perceived security breach or other incident may also lead to the expenditure of significant financial and other resources in efforts to investigate or correct a breach, address and eliminate vulnerabilities and prevent future security breaches or incidents, as well as the incurring of significant expenses for remediation that may include liability for stolen assets or information, repair of system damage that may have been caused, and other liabilities. We have incurred and expect to incur significant expenses in an effort to prevent security breaches and other incidents, including deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training personnel and engaging third-party experts and consultants.\nWe may acquire other assets or businesses, or form collaborations or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of businesses and assets or enter into strategic alliances and collaborations, to initiate and then expand our operations. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction, any of which could have a detrimental effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have limited experience with acquiring other companies and assets and limited experience with forming strategic alliances and collaborations. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and if we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we may incur additional debt or assume unknown or contingent liabilities in connection therewith. Integration of an acquired company or assets may also disrupt ongoing operations, require the hiring of additional personnel and the implementation of additional internal systems and infrastructure, especially the acquisition of commercial assets, and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. We may not be able to find suitable strategic alliances or collaboration partners or identify other investment opportunities, and we may experience losses related to any such investments.\nTo finance any acquisitions or collaborations, we may choose to issue debt or equity securities as consideration. Any such issuance of securities would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other assets or companies or fund a transaction using our stock as consideration. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for acquisitions through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nBecause we do not have an audit or compensation committee, shareholders will have to rely on our entire Board of Directors to perform these functions.\nWe do not have an audit or compensation committee. These functions are performed by our Board of Directors of as a whole. Thus, there is a potential conflict in that board members who are also part of management will participate in discussions concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions.\nWe expect to face intense competition, often from companies with greater resources and experience than we have.\nAs part of our growth strategy we intend to make acquisitions. To acquire qualified companies, we are likely to face competition from companies that have substantially greater financial, technological, managerial and research and development resources and experience than we have. In addition, if we are successful in closing an acquisition of one or more target companies, these acquired companies are likely to face competition for their service and product offerings from large and well-established companies that have greater marketing and sales experience and capabilities than we have. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may be unable to grow, sustain our revenue or be successful in achieving our business plan.\nCurrent global financial conditions have been characterized by increased volatility which could negatively impact our business, prospects, liquidity and financial condition.\nCurrent global financial conditions and recent market events have been characterized by increased volatility and the resulting tightening of the credit and capital markets has reduced the amount of available liquidity and overall economic activity. We cannot guarantee that debt or equity financing, the ability to borrow funds or cash generated by operations will be available or sufficient to meet or satisfy our initiatives, objectives or requirements. Our inability to access sufficient amounts of capital on terms acceptable to us for our operations will negatively impact our business, prospects, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur potential for rapid growth and our entry into new markets make it difficult for us to evaluate our current and future business prospects, and we may be unable to effectively manage any growth associated with these new markets, which may increase the risk of your investment and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur entry into new markets as we seek to expand our business and seek to acquire complementary businesses may place a significant strain on our resources and increase demands on our executive management, personnel and systems, and our operational, administrative and financial resources may be inadequate. We may also not be able to effectively manage any expanded operations or achieve planned growth on a timely or profitable basis, particularly if our number of customers significantly increases or their demands and needs change as our business expands. If we are unable to manage expanded operations effectively, we may experience operating inefficiencies, the quality of our products and services could deteriorate, and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to develop and maintain our brand and reputation for our service and product offerings, our business and prospects could be materially harmed.\nOur business and prospects depend, in part, on developing and then maintaining and strengthening our brand and reputation in the markets we will serve and for the companies we acquire. If problems arise with our future products or services, our brand and reputation could be diminished. If we fail to develop, promote and maintain our brand and reputation successfully, our business and prospects could be materially harmed.\nAny failure to protect our future intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our technology and our brand.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights of the companies we expect to acquire. We expect to rely upon a combination of trademark and trade secret laws, as well as license and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. To the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties may gain access to our proprietary information, develop and market products similar to ours or use trademarks similar to ours, each of which could materially harm our business. The failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur expansion into new products, services, technologies, and geographic regions subjects us to additional risks.\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer markets, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technological challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. Profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off.\nThe impact of epidemics or pandemics may limit our future business both from the demand and supply sides. Our sales people may not be able to effectively engage with customers due to restrictions on travel, conferences and in-person meetings. Our supply chain may be impacted by production and distribution delays. Due to these factors, we may limit future operations to reduce expenses until events support and allow normal business procedures.\nOur current business and future acquired businesses and/or operations both domestic and abroad, and the businesses of our potential customers could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to a pandemic or other health crisis, such as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as well as the variants.\nThe growth of the businesses we acquire may, in part, be reliant on the willingness of customers to invest in their products and solutions. The risk, or public perception of the risk, of a pandemic or media coverage of infectious diseases could cause customers to avoid purchases which would delay sales of those products and solutions.\nOur financial results fluctuate and may be difficult to forecast, and this may cause a decline in the trading price of our stock.\nOur revenues, expenses and operating results are difficult to predict given our limited history of current operations. We expect that our operating results will continue to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf Our ability to increase our brand awareness;\n\u25cf Our ability to attract new customers;\n\u25cf Our ability to increase our customer base;\n\u25cf The amount and timing of costs relating to the expansion of our operations, including sales and marketing expenditures;\n\u25cf Our ability to introduce new mobile payment offerings or customer services in a competitive environment; and\n\u25cf Our ability to manage third-party outsourced operations;\nDue to all of these factors, our operating results may fall below the expectations of investors, which could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nOur plans for expansion cannot be implemented if we lose our key personnel or cannot recruit additional personnel.\nWe depend substantially on the continued services, specialized knowledge and performance of our senior management, particularly but not limited to Howard Gostfrand, Laura Anthony, Brian Klatsky and Lauren Klatsky. We do not have employment agreements with these individuals, and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. As a result, these officers may elect to pursue other opportunities at any time. If one or more of these individuals choose to leave our Company, we may lose a significant number of relationships and operating expertise which they have developed over many years and which would be difficult to replace. The loss of the services of any executive officer or other key employee could hurt our business.\nIn addition, as our business expands, we will need to add new information technology and engineering personnel to maintain and expand our systems and customer support personnel to serve our growing customer base. If we are unable to hire and successfully train employees or contractors in these areas, users of our platform may have negative experiences and we may lose customers, which would diminish the value of our brand and harm our business. The market for recruiting qualified information technology and other personnel is extremely competitive, and we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining employees. Should we fail to retain or attract qualified personnel, we may not be able to compete successfully or implement our plans for expansion.\nWe have an evolving business model with still untested growth initiatives.\nWe have an evolving business model and intend to implement new strategies to grow our business in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing new product categories or in entering new specialty markets or in implementing any other growth strategies. Similarly, there can be no assurance that we already have or will be able to obtain or retain any employees, consultants or other resources with any specialized skills or relationships to successfully implement our strategies in the future.\nWe rely on third-party systems to conduct our business and relationships with payment processors, advertisers, third party sellers of our products, and our revenues and market share may decrease if these third-party relationship and systems are unavailable in the future or if they no longer offer quality performance.\nWe rely on third-party computer systems and third-party service providers, including payment services such as Shopify Payment for credit card verifications and confirmations, to host our website and to advertise and deliver the products sold on our website to customers. We also rely on third-party licenses for components of the software underlying our technology platform. Any interruption in our ability to obtain the products or services of these or other third parties or deterioration in their performance could impair the timing and quality of our own service. If our service providers fail to deliver high-quality services in a timely manner to our customers, our services will not meet the expectations of our customers and our reputation and brand will be damaged. Furthermore, if our arrangements with any of these third parties are terminated, we may not find an alternate source of systems support on a timely basis or on terms as advantageous to us. In addition, our contracts or arrangements with suppliers do not provide for the continuation of particular pricing practices, for the availability of any specific services and generally may be terminated by either party. If we are unable to develop and maintain relationships with these third-party suppliers that will allow us to obtain sufficient levels of service on acceptable commercial terms, such inability could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors including larger, well-established and well-financed NIL and sports focused companies.\nMany of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote substantially more resources to systems development than we do. Increased competition may result in reduced operating margins, loss of market share and a diminished brand franchise. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors.\nOur business depends on effective marketing, including marketing via email and social networking messaging, and we intend to increase our spending on marketing and branding, which may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe depend on effective marketing to attract customers and merchants. We depend on email and social networking messaging to promote our site and offerings and to generate a substantial portion of our revenues. If we are unable to develop, implement and maintain effective and efficient cost-effective advertising and marketing programs, it would have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business. Further, as part of our growth strategies, we intend to increase our spending on marketing and branding initiatives significantly, which may adversely affect our financial results. There is no assurance that any increase in our marketing or branding expenditures will result in increased market shares or will ultimately have a positive effect on our financial results.\nUse of social media may adversely impact our reputation.\nThere has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices, including blogs, social media websites and other forms of internet-based communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Consumers value readily available information concerning retailers, manufacturers, and their goods and services and often act on such information without further investigation, authentication and without regard to its accuracy. The availability of information on social media platforms and devices is virtually immediate as is its impact. Social media platforms and devices immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. The opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate information, is seemingly limitless and readily available. Information concerning our company may be posted on such platforms and devices at any time. Information posted may be adverse to our interests, may be inaccurate, and may harm our performance, prospects or business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Such platforms also could be used for the dissemination of trade secret information or otherwise compromise valuable company assets, all of which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Digital Assets\nWhether a particular digital asset is a security in any relevant jurisdiction is subject to a high degree of uncertainty, and if we are unable to properly characterize a digital asset, we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny, inquiries, investigations, fines, and other penalties, which may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe SEC and its staff have taken the position that certain crypto assets (which includes digital assets) fall within the definition of a security under the U.S. federal securities laws. We do not believe that the digital assets we have sold are securities, however, regardless of our conclusions, we could be subject to legal or regulatory action in the event the SEC, a state or foreign regulatory authority, or a court were to determine that a digital asset listed and sold on our platform is a security under applicable laws.\nThe classification of a digital asset as a security under applicable law has wide-ranging implications for the regulatory obligations that flow from the offer and sale of such assets. For example, a digital asset that is a security in the United States may generally only be offered or sold in the United States pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC or in an offering that qualifies for an exemption from registration. Persons that effect transactions in digital assets that are securities in the United States may be subject to registration with the SEC as a broker or dealer. Platforms that bring together purchasers and sellers to trade digital assets that are securities in the United States are generally subject to registration as national securities exchanges, or must qualify for an exemption, such as by being operated by a registered broker-dealer as an ATS in compliance with rules for ATSs. Persons facilitating clearing and settlement of securities may be subject to registration with the SEC as a clearing agency. Foreign jurisdictions may have similar licensing, registration, and qualification requirements.\nWe have policies and procedures to analyze whether the digital assets that we sold on our platform could be deemed to be a security under applicable laws. Our policies and procedures do not constitute a legal standard but rather represent our company-developed model, which permits us to make a risk-based assessment regarding the likelihood that a particular digital asset could be deemed a security under applicable laws. Regardless of our conclusions, we could be subject to legal or regulatory action in the event the SEC, a state or foreign regulatory authority, or a court were to determine that a digital asset listed and sold on our platform is a security under applicable laws. Customers that purchased such digital assets on our platform and suffered losses could also seek to rescind a transaction that we facilitated as the basis that it was conducted in violation of applicable law, which could subject us to liability.\nAlthough we no longer offer a secondary market or trading platform, we did at one time. Our secondary market was not registered or licensed with the SEC or foreign authorities as a broker-dealer, national securities exchange, or ATS (or foreign equivalents), and we will not seek to register or rely on an exemption from such registration or license. We could be subject to legal or regulatory action in the event the SEC, a state or foreign regulatory authority, or a court were to determine that we operated an unregistered exchange, unregistered broker-dealer or unregistered clearly agency. We believe that our risk is reduced as no secondary or trading transactions were attempted or occurred on our marketplace, but regardless of our conclusion our business would be significantly impacted if the SEC, a state or foreign regulatory authority, or a court were to determine otherwise.\nIn addition, we could be subject to judicial or administrative sanctions for failing to offer or sell the digital assets in compliance with the registration requirements, or for acting as a broker, dealer, or national securities exchange without appropriate registration. Such an action could result in injunctions, cease and desist orders, as well as civil monetary penalties, fines, and disgorgement, criminal liability, and reputational harm.\nThere are risks associated with operating a marketplace for digital assets.\nThere are risks associated with marketplaces for digital assets that sell user generated content, including but not limited to, counterfeit assets, intellectual property violations, unregistered sales of securities, assets on smart contracts with bugs, and assets that may become untransferable. These risks could create liability and have an adverse effect on the Company.\nOur risk management efforts may not be effective to prevent fraudulent activities by third-party providers or other parties, which could expose us to material financial losses and liability and otherwise harm our business.\nWe contract with third-party providers for applications available through our platform, as well as some services required to maintain the platform. We may be targeted by parties, including customers, hackers, or third-party providers, who seek to commit acts of financial fraud using techniques such as stolen identities and bank accounts, compromised email accounts, employee or insider fraud, account takeover, or other types of fraud. We may suffer losses from acts of financial fraud committed by our employees or third parties.\nThe techniques used to perpetrate fraud on our platform and the applications accessed through our platform are continually evolving, and we expend considerable resources to monitor and combat them, and to inform customers of the limits to the control we have over third-party provider activities. Additionally, when we introduce new products and applications, or expand existing products, we may not be able to identify all risks created by the new products or applications. Our risk management policies and procedures may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks to which we or our customers are exposed, to enable us to prevent or mitigate the risks we have identified, or to identify additional risks to which we or our customers may become subject in the future. Furthermore, our risk management policies and procedures may contain errors, or our employees or agents may commit mistakes or errors in judgment as a result of which we may suffer large financial losses.\nThe growth of our business will continue to place significant demands on our risk management efforts, and we will need to continue developing and improving our existing risk management policies and procedures. As techniques used to perpetrate fraud on our platform evolve, we may need to modify our platform, services or agreements with third parties to mitigate fraud risks. Further, these types of fraudulent activities on our platform can also expose us to civil and criminal liability, governmental and regulatory sanctions as well as potentially cause us to be in breach of our contractual obligations to our third-party providers.\nDigital asset collectibles may be a relatively illiquid asset.\nWe do not currently offer digital asset collectibles but have done so in the past and although we do not intend to do so in the near future, it could become a part of our overall collectible market strategy. While many digital assets can be bought and sold easily, in the case of digital asset collectibles, we will need to identify buyers who are willing to pay a certain price for a particular, one-of-a-kind item. If we elect to dispose of a digital asset collectible through an auction house, commissions will be to the auction house that will reduce our returns. In addition, following a sale at auction, a successful bidder may fail to pay in accordance with the timescales laid down by the relevant auction house resulting in either (i) delayed payment by said bidder; or (ii) the need for us to sell the work either privately, via a gallery or at a subsequent auction, in either case resulting in losses for us.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock is subject to risks arising from restrictions on reliance on Rule 144 by shell companies or former shell companies.\nUnder a regulation of the SEC known as Rule 144, a person who beneficially owns restricted securities of an issuer and who is not an affiliate of that issuer may sell them without registration under the Securities Act provided that certain conditions have been met. One of these conditions is that such person has held the restricted securities for a prescribed period, which will be six months for the common stock. However, Rule 144 is unavailable for the resale of securities issued by an issuer that is a shell company (other than a business combination related shell company) or, unless certain conditions are met, that has been at any time previously a shell company.\nThe SEC defines a shell company as a company that has (a) no or nominal operations and (b) either (i) no or nominal assets, (ii) assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or (iii) assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets.\nAs a result of a transaction reported on Form 8-K on August 4, 2021, we ceased being a shell company as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. While we believe that we ceased to be a shell company, the SEC and others whose approval is required in order for shares to be sold under Rule 144 might take a different view.\nRule 144 is available for the resale of securities of former shell companies if and for as long as the following conditions are met:\n(i) the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company;\n(ii) the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;\n(iii) the issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Current Reports on Form 8-K; and\n(iv) at least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current comprehensive disclosure with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company known as Form 10 Information.\nOur common stock price may decrease due to factors beyond our control.\nThe stock market from time to time has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected the market prices for early-stage companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our stock. If OpenLockers stockholders sell substantial amounts of their stock in the public market, the price of our stock could fall. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity, or equity-related securities, in the future at a price we deem appropriate.\nThe market price of our stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors, most of which are beyond our control:\n\u25cf variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf changes in general economic conditions;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u25cf poor reviews;\n\u25cf loss of a major customer, partner or joint venture participant; and\n\u25cf the addition or loss of key managerial and collaborative personnel.\nAny such fluctuations may adversely affect the market price or value of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. As a result, stockholders may be unable to sell their shares, or may be forced to sell them at a loss.\nOur common stock is subject to the application of the penny stock rules which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and increase transaction costs to sell those shares.\nThe SEC has adopted rule 3a51-1 which establishes the definition of a penny stock, for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, Rule 15g-9 requires:\n\u25cf that a broker or dealer approve a persons account for transactions in penny stocks, and\n\u25cf the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a persons account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must:\n\u25cf obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person, and\n\u25cf make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form:\n\u25cf sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination and\n\u25cf that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.\nGenerally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the penny stock rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.\nThe market price for our common stock is particularly volatile, which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. You may be unable to sell your common stock shares at or above your purchase price, or at all, which may result in substantial losses to you.\nThe market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. As a consequence of this enhanced risk, more risk-adverse investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress, be more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a seasoned issuer. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common shares, regardless of our operating performance. We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common stock shares will be at any time, or if our common stock shares will ever be able to trade, or as to what effect the sale of shares or the availability of common stock shares for sale at any time will have on the prevailing market price.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid any cash dividends on our stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board.\nIf we are unable to comply with the financial reporting requirements mandated by the SECs regulations, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the price of our common stock could decline.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely, accurate and reliable periodic financial statements could be impaired. If we do not maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy of our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act. Additionally, our ability to obtain additional financing could be impaired or a lack of investor confidence in the reliability and accuracy of its public reporting could cause our stock price to decline. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable. Item 2. Properties\nOur principal executive offices are located at 1700 Palm Beach Lakes Blvd., Suite 820, West Palm Beach, FL 33401. This office space is provided to us at no charge by one of our executive officers and directors. In addition, OpenLocker maintains an office at 320 Broad Street, Red Bank, NJ 07701. The Company is leasing the office space from a family member of OpenLockers Chief Executive Officer on a month to month basis. We believe that these properties are adequate to support the Companys existing operations and that we will be able to obtain appropriate additional facilities or alternative facilities on commercially reasonable terms if and when necessary. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nrom time to time, we are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. To the knowledge of our management, there are no legal proceedings currently pending against us which we believe would have a material effect on our business, financial position or results of operations and, to the best of our knowledge, there are no such legal proceedings contemplated or threatened. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nPrice Range of Securities\nSince December 9, 2022, our common stock has traded on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Market Group LLCs Marketplace under the symbol OLKR. Prior to October 2022, our common stock traded under the symbol DSRO. Prior to April 2022, our common stock traded under the symbol WTCG.\nThe OTC Market is a network of security dealers who buy and sell stock. The dealers are connected by a computer network that provides information on current bids and asks, as well as volume information. The trading of securities on the OTC Pink is often sporadic and investors may have difficulty buying and selling our shares or obtaining market quotations for them, which may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated the high and low bid quotations for our common stock. These quotations represent inter-dealer quotations, without adjustment for retail markup, markdown, or commission and may not represent actual transactions.\nCommon Stock (1)\nLow High\nFiscal 2022\nFirst Quarter (August 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021) $ 0.3242 $ 1.3000\nSecond Quarter (November 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022) $ 0.9000 $ 0.5150\nThird Quarter (February 1, 2022 to April 30, 2022) $ 1.1000 $ 0.5400\nFourth Quarter (May 1, 2022 to July 31, 2022) $ 0.8700 $ 0.2000\nFiscal 2023\nFirst Quarter (August 1, 2022 to October 31, 2022) $ 0.3388 $ 0.6853\nSecond Quarter (November 1, 2022 to January 31, 2023) $ 0.2924 $ 0.4970\nThird Quarter (February 1, 2023 to April 30, 2023) $ 0.2897 $ 0.6280\nFourth Quarter (May 1, 2023 to July 31, 2023) $ 0.2460 $ 0.3961\nFiscal 2024\nFirst Quarter (August 1, 2023 to October 31, 2023) (1) $ 0.2000 $ 0.3906\nOn October 31, 2023, the closing price of our common stock was $0.20. As of November 1, 2023, we had 41,379,650 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.\nHolders\nAs of November 1, 2023, there were approximately 524 holders of record of our common stock.\nDividends\nThe Company has not paid any dividends on its common stock to date. The existing covenants under certain of our credit facilities also place limits on our ability to issue dividends and repurchase stock.\nIt is the present intention of the Company to retain any earnings for use in its business operations and, accordingly, the Company does not anticipate the board of directors declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock. Consequently, you will only realize an economic gain on your investment in our common stock if the price appreciates. You should not purchase our common stock expecting to receive cash dividends. Since we do not anticipate paying dividends, and if we are not successful in establishing an orderly public trading market for our shares, then you may not have any manner to liquidate or receive any payment on your investment. Therefore, our failure to pay dividends may cause you to not see any return on your investment even if we are successful in our business operations. In addition, because we may not pay dividends in the foreseeable future, we may have trouble raising additional funds which could affect our ability to expand our business operations.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company issued 9,000 shares of Series A preferred stock to certain officers and directors of the Company for an aggregate purchase price of $6,000 (equal to a per share purchase price of $0.6666).\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company issued 1,425,000 shares of common stock to third parties and 1,425,000 warrants with a term of 5 years and an exercise price of $1.00 for an aggregate purchase price of $285,000 (equal to a per unit purchase price of $0.20).\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company issued 125,000 shares of common stock to third parties for an aggregate purchase price of $50,000 (equal to a per share price of $0.40).\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company issued 769,644 shares of common stock to third parties for services rendered with a value of $__________.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2023 the Company issued 1,478,050 options with a 10 year term and an exercise price of $0.70.

Item 6. Reserved Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of OpenLocker Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(the Company or OpenLocker) is dedicated to offering marketing solutions for collegiate and professional sports organizations and athletes to deepen fan engagement through innovative collectibles, membership rewards, exclusive events and experiences.\nThe OpenLocker mission is to empower athletes by monetizing their Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) with autographed collectibles, meaningful fan experiences and partnerships with local merchants, regional and national brands.\nOpenLocker launched its first fan community at the University of Connecticut in February 2022, during the first season following the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) policy change allowing student-athletes to receive compensation for their NIL. The Company deliberately included all 14 eligible members of the mens basketball team to galvanize the fan base and name the fan community the Bone Yard Huskyz Club (BYHC). The OpenLocker design team created the BYHC logo and Huskyz avatar to play off of the universitys Huskies mascot and to have an edgy feel. A Huskyz avatar was created in the likeness of each of the athletes and selected super fans for branding and awareness campaigns. A website with a project roadmap outlining the perks and rewards of club membership was activated two weeks prior to the release date, which was strategically timed around the basketball teams season schedule. A comprehensive marketing campaign included digital programmatic advertising, organic and paid social media strategy (including pre- and post-drop Twitter spaces conversations with fans, blockchain experts, athletes and parents of athletes), podcasts, email blasts and gorilla marketing at several home basketball games. The OpenLocker athlete liaison also provided the athletes with graphics and talking points they could use to leverage their social media followings and promote sales of their collectibles by word-of-mouth.\nOpenLocker initially sold digital collectibles, also known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), due to the popularity at the time and advantages that blockchain technology offered for authenticating collectibles and providing utility and rewards to UConn fans. OpenLocker minted the NFTs on the FLOW blockchain and sold them on its e-commerce platform for fiat currency to appeal to an audience unfamiliar with cryptocurrency. A majority of the revenue from the BYHC project was generated on the first day of sales. The first two hours were the busiest as fans were incentivized by the free autographed Platinum card that was included with purchase for the first 25 digital collectibles sold per athlete. This unique collectible is a metal, wallet-sized card hand-signed by the athlete with the digital art printed on the front and quick response (QR) code that directs to the boneyardhuskyzclub.com. Customer behavior and feedback confirmed that the physical collectible was deemed to be of greater value to the majority of fans, who had little to no experience with blockchain technology. Since then, OpenLocker has directed its efforts to marketing and selling autographed physical collectibles along with community membership rewards programs, events and experiences.\nFollowing the success of its college fan community model, OpenLocker launched the OpenStable marketplace in April 2022 to engage the next generation of thoroughbred racing enthusiasts. Through its relationships with owners, trainers and influencers in the racing industry, OpenStable aimed to give fans access to exclusive information, real life experiences, and memorabilia so that they could engage in a truly immersive journey covering a racehorses career. By offering both autographed physical collectibles and ownership of digital collectibles which unlocked rewards and experiences, both in the virtual and physical realms, OpenStable was intended to attract a younger audience with a goal to develop the next generation of thoroughbred racing fans.\nThe Company continued to include digital collectibles with the purchase of a physical collectible featuring student-athlete NIL in the following NCAA athletic season so it would have the option to use blockchain technology to verify ownership for its fan loyalty programs. However, the Company has discontinued sale and distribution of digital collectibles, including NFTs, as there was little interest evidenced by the fact that so few customers actually completed the steps required to view and claim them to a personal digital wallet. The OpenLocker NFT viewer remains accessible so that existing owners may continue to have access to their digital collectibles while the Company focuses on delivering physical collectibles and enhancing the fan experience by removing barriers to fan engagement.\nIn addition, from April 2022 through September 2022, Openlocker offered a secondary marketplace for peer-to-peer transactions of digital collectibles, however, no secondary sales were effectuated or attempted and as of September 2022 this secondary marketplace was discontinued. Although, OpenLocker no longer operates a trading platform, owners of issued digital collectibles may transfer their digital collectible to their personal digital wallet and thereafter transfer such digital collectible to the wallet of their choice.\nAs of November 1, 2023, OpenLocker has active fan communities at University of Florida (Gataverse), Florida Atlantic University (PowerOwls Club) and Radford University (RowdyRedz) and is focusing on building club membership rewards programs. While OpenLocker pays athletes a majority of revenue generated from sales of collectibles containing their NIL and compensating them for social media activities and appearances, the Company retains all revenue from sales of community-branded collectibles which do not use athlete NIL nor the marks and logos of any institution. By partnering with local businesses as well as regional and national brands who can offer perks and rewards to community members, OpenLocker is able to create demand and further engage fans and the local community.\nIn addition to supporting the athletes, for each fan community, holders of issued digital collectibles and/or authenticated physical collectibles are entitled to participate in any club membership activities, perks or benefits which the Company may offer or arrange from time to time. Such perks or benefits may include, for example, access to community events (such as meet and greet with athletes), giveaways, and rewards based on an athletes performance.\nOpenLocker is also in discussions with NIL collectives, communities focused on raising funds for school-specific NIL fundraising efforts, that are interested in offering membership rewards programs to their target audiences.\nThe Company is also in discussions with national brands who are interested in leveraging their relationships with student-athletes to create social media influencer campaigns and build customer loyalty programs.\nOpenLockers current revenue model includes (i) sales on the OpenLocker platform, (ii) sponsorship and advertising, and (iii) service fees for creative design work, development and product fulfillment services.\nOpenLocker believes that it has found a unique and attractive market for autographed collectibles and community rewards programs by focusing on the college athlete market, as we believe that interest in college sports is growing.\nPrincipal Products and Services\nOpenLocker aims to provide a comprehensive suite of collectibles, products and services, adopting a hybrid flexible model creating products both licensed and non-licensed with colleges, professional sports teams, leagues, brands, etc.\nAutographed Physical Collectibles (Authenticated Physical Collectibles)\nThe Platinum Card by OpenLocker is a metal, wallet-sized card that has the digital art print sublimated on one side and a QR code printed on the other side which directs to the fan community online portal. The serial number is laser engraved on the card and there is space reserved for the athlete to hand-sign.\nThe Company also offers autographed collectibles made of PVC plastic that is even more durable, making it a preferable material to carry around.\nThe Platinum Card entitles the holder to receive any perks or benefits that may be offered by OpenLocker and its brand partners.\nGear\nOpenLocker also sells exclusive gear, including t-shirts, sweatshirts, hats and pins, in its exclusive gear shops.\nOpenLocker Marketplace\nThe OpenLocker Marketplace provides a user-friendly shopping experience for sports fans to purchase membership cards, gear and collectibles featuring their favorite athletes for access to exclusive perks and rewards.\nSports Branding Services\nOpenLocker also provides branding services for individual athletes, university collectives, horse owners/trainers, and other entities interested in creating a distinctive identity, building their fan base, and maximizing revenue. From logo creation and styling to social media messaging and activation campaigns, OpenLockers team can provide enhanced support to collaborating colleges and athletes.\nPlan of Operations\nOver the next 12 months, we expect to require approximately $2,000,000 in operating funds to carry out our intended plan of operations.\nWe are planning to obtain the funds necessary to execute our plan of operations from various capital raises, including potentially through private placements or our common stock or the issuance and sales of convertible notes, as well as potentially through a registration statement or an offering statement filed with the SEC.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary funds for our foregoing operations on terms that are acceptable to us or at all, and there can be no assurance that our plan of operations can be executed as planned, or at all.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRevenues\nDuring the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, we generated revenues of $81,179 and $208, respectively. The lack of revenue was a result of an inability to execute on any business due to limited capital and management resources.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 were $2,430,337 and $2,494,425, respectively. The increase in expenses was due to a rise in fixed general administrative expenses and increased research and development.\nLoss from Operations\nLoss from operations for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 was $2,549,810 and $2,494,217, respectively. The increase in expenses was due to a rise in fixed general administrative expenses and increased research and development.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 was $7,425,932 and $2,556,714, respectively. The increase in expenses was due to impairment of investment, impairment of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, and a rise in fixed general administrative expenses and increased research and development.\nThere is significant uncertainty projecting future profitability due to our history of losses and lack of revenues. In our current state, we have no recurring or guaranteed source of revenues and cannot predict when, if ever, we will become profitable. There is significant uncertainty projecting future profitability due to our minimal operating history and lack of guaranteed ongoing revenue streams.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of July 31, 2023, we had $15,539 in cash, $8,000 in accounts receivable, and did not have any other cash equivalents. The following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for all financial statement periods presented in this Annual Report. To date, we have financed our operations through the issuance of stock and borrowings.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022:\nFiscal Year Ended July 31,\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (978,976 ) $ (286,527 )\nNet cash provided by investing activities - 13,326\nNet cash provided by financing activities 387,380 827,158\nNet increase (decrease) in cash (591,596 ) 553,957\nCash, beginning of year 607,135 53,178\nCash, end of year $ 15,539 $ 607,135\nSince inception, we have financed our cash flow requirements through issuance of common stock and debt financing. As we expand our activities, we may, and most likely will, continue to experience net negative cash flows from operations. We anticipate obtaining additional financing to fund operations through additional common stock offerings, to the extent available, or to obtain additional financing to the extent necessary to augment our working capital.\nWe anticipate that we will incur operating losses in the next twelve months. Our lack of operating history makes predictions of future operating results difficult to ascertain. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. Such risks for us include, but are not limited to, an evolving and unpredictable business model and the management of growth. To address these risks, we must, among other things, obtain a customer base, implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy, continually develop and upgrade our website, provide national and regional industry participants with an effective, efficient and accessible website on which to promote their products and services through the Internet, respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so can have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nGoing Concern and Managements Plans\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.\nAs reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, the Company had:\n\u25cf Net loss of $7,425,932; and\n\u25cf Net cash used in operations of $978,976.\nAdditionally, at July 31, 2023, the Company had:\n\u25cf Accumulated deficit of $10,134,087;\n\u25cf Stockholders deficit of $97,676; and\n\u25cf Working capital of $(100,855).\nWe manage liquidity risk by reviewing, on an ongoing basis, our sources of liquidity and capital requirements. The Company has cash on hand of $15,539 at July 31, 2023. Although the Company intends to raise additional debt or equity capital, the Company expects to continue to incur significant losses from operations and have negative cash flows from operating activities for the near-term. These losses could be significant as operations ramp up along with continuing expenses related to compensation, professional fees, and regulatory are incurred.\nThe Company has incurred significant losses since its inception and has not demonstrated an ability to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitable operations. There can be no assurance that profitable operations will ever be achieved, or if achieved, could be sustained on a continuing basis. In making this assessment, we performed a comprehensive analysis of our current circumstances, including our financial position, our cash flows and cash usage forecasts for the twelve months ended July 31, 2023, and our current capital structure including equity-based instruments and our obligations and debts.\nThe Company has satisfied its obligations from the issuance of common stock; however, there is no assurance that such successful efforts will continue during the twelve months subsequent to the date these consolidated financial statements are issued.\nIf the Company does not obtain additional capital, the Company will be required to reduce the scope of its business development activities or cease operations. The Company continues to explore obtaining additional capital financing and the Company is closely monitoring its cash balances, cash needs, and expense levels.\nThese factors create substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern within the twelve-month period subsequent to the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.\nManagements strategic plans include the following:\n\u25cf Pursuing additional capital raising opportunities,\n\u25cf Continuing to explore and execute prospective partnering or distribution opportunities\u037e\n\u25cf Identifying strategic acquisitions; and\n\u25cf Identifying unique market opportunities that represent potential positive short-term cash flow.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and those estimates may be material.\nGoodwill and Impairment\nIn financial reporting, goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually (July 31) or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We assess potential impairment by considering present economic conditions as well as future expectations. All assessments of goodwill impairment are conducted at the individual reporting unit level.\nThe Company uses qualitative factors according to ASC 350-20-35-3 to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company determined that given various negative financial indicators (quantitative and qualitative), goodwill of $2,943,874 was fully impaired and recorded as a component of other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. There were no impairments recorded for the year ended July 31, 2022. See Note 6.\nIntangible Assets and Impairment\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually. The Company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company determined that given various negative financial indicators (quantitative and qualitative), intangible assets (net of amortization) of $1,916,270 was fully impaired and recorded as a component of other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. There were no impairments recorded for the year ended July 31, 2022. See Note 7.\nRevenue Recognition\nOpenLocker generates revenue from two main sources, our collectibles and sponsorship revenues.\nRevenue is recognized in accordance with FASB Topic ASC No. 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company recognizes revenue when its performance obligations are complete, which occurs at a point in time related to the transfer of an NFT to its customer. Currently, all sales contain a single performance obligation.\nRelated to the sale of physical collectibles and merchandise, all payments are received from third-party payment processing providers. The Company receives payments from sales on its primary marketplace (Shopify site) as well as two other sources. Each of these sources of payment relate to the completion of a single performance obligation completed at a point in time, which occurs upon the transfer of a collectible and where no further performance obligations are required:\n\u25cf Shopify payouts from credit/debit cards transactions typically occur 2-3 days after date of sale,\n\u25cf PayPal payments are received same day; and\nShipping fees collected from customers for physical collectibles are included with revenues received from Shopify payouts. The majority of those collectibles have not yet been shipped due to a delay in receiving the goods from our vendor. Prior to the product shipping, any amounts received in advance are accounted for as contract liabilities (deferred revenue).\nRelated to sponsorships, the Company generates revenues from sponsorship arrangements, in which the customer sponsors an athlete, event or sports team. In exchange for the sponsorship, the customer receives specified brand recognition and other benefits over a set period of time and will recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the time period specified in the contract. Related performance obligations for sponsorship arrangements are recognized ratably over this period of time.\nSoftware Development Costs\nInternal-use software development costs are accounted for in accordance with ASC 350- 40, Internal-Use Software. The costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as research and development costs as incurred.\nOnce an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs incurred to develop internal-use software are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software (typically three to five years).\nMaintenance and enhancement costs, including those costs in the post-implementation stages, are typically expensed as incurred, unless such costs relate to substantial upgrades and enhancements to the software that result in added functionality, in which case the costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software.\nThe Company reviews the carrying value for impairment whenever facts and circumstances exist that would suggest that assets might be impaired or that the useful lives should be modified. Amortization expense related to capitalized internal-use software development costs will be included in cost of goods sold in the statements of operations.\nFor the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company expensed $247,181 and $46,667, respectively, in software development costs.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAs required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of July 31, 2023. Based upon this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of July 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective.\nWe do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2023. Our managements evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting was based on the 2013 framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that as of July 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective.\nThe ineffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was due to material weaknesses that we identified in our internal control over financial reporting, including a lack of formal documentation of controls and processes, a lack of segregation of duties, and a lack of formal review process. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We expect to address the material weakness by hiring additional qualified members of management. Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our Companys financial results.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm in accordance with applicable rules of the SEC.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the three months ended July 31, 2023, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Rather, our full board of directors performs the functions of these committees. We do not believe it is necessary for our board of directors to appoint such committees because the volume of matters that come before our board of directors for consideration permits the directors to give sufficient time and attention to such matters to be involved in all decision making. Additionally, because our common stock is not listed for trading or quotation on a national securities exchange, we are not required to have such committees.\nDirector Independence & Stockholder Director Nominee Recommendations\nWe have no independent directors, as such term is defined in the listing standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market, at this time. The Company is not quoted on any exchange that requires director independence requirements. We do not have a policy regarding the consideration of any director candidates that may be recommended by our stockholders, including the minimum qualifications for director candidates, nor have our officers and directors established a process for identifying and evaluating director nominees. We have not adopted a policy regarding the handling of any potential recommendation of director candidates by our stockholders, including the procedures to be followed. Our officers and directors have not considered or adopted any of these policies as we have never received a recommendation from any stockholder for any candidate to serve on our board of directors.\nGiven our relative size and lack of directors and officers insurance coverage, we do not anticipate that any of our stockholders will make such a recommendation in the near future. While there have been no nominations of additional directors proposed, in the event such a proposal is made, all current members of our board will participate in the consideration of director nominees.\nUntil such time as our Company further develops our business, achieves a stronger revenue base and has sufficient working capital to purchase directors and officers insurance, we do not have any immediate prospects to attract independent directors. When we are able to expand our board to include one or more independent directors, we intend to establish an audit committee of our board of directors. It is our intention that one or more of these independent directors will also qualify as an audit committee financial expert. Our securities are not quoted on an exchange that has requirements that a majority of our board members be independent and we are not currently otherwise subject to any law, rule or regulation requiring that all or any portion of our board of directors include independent directors, nor are we required to establish or maintain an audit committee or other committee of our board.\nCode of Ethics\nWe have not yet adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of our employees, officers and directors, including those officers responsible for financial reporting. We expect that we will adopt a code of ethics in the near future.\nFamily Relationships\nBrian Klatsky and Lauren Klatsky are siblings. Other than the foregoing, there are no family relationships among any of our executive officers or directors. Item 11. Executive Compensation.\nThe following table summarizes all compensation recorded by us in the past two fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 for:\n\u25cf our principal executive officer or other individual serving in a similar capacity during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, and\n\u25cf our two most highly compensated executive officers, other than our principal executive officer, who were serving as corporate officers at July 31, 2023.\nFor definitional purposes, these individuals are sometimes referred to as the named executive officers.\nSummary Compensation Table\nName and Principal Position Fiscal Year Ended Salary ($) Bonus ($) Stock Awards ($) Option Awards ($) All Other Compensation ($) Total ($)\nHoward Gostfrand, 7/31/2023 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ -\nChief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer 7/31/2022 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ -\nLaura Anthony, 7/31/2023 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ -\nPresident 7/31/2022 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ -\nBrian Klatsky, 7/31/2023 - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ -\nPresident of OpenLocker, Inc. 7/31/2022 - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ -\nEmployment Agreements\nNone.\nOutstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End\nAs of July 31, 2023, there were no outstanding options, warrants or equity awards.\nCompensation Plans\nAs of July 31, 2023, the Company reserved 750,000 shares of Company common stock for issuance to OpenLocker employees as options, restricted stock or similar incentive compensation, as may be determined by the Board.\nExecutive Compensation Philosophy\nOur Board determines the compensation given to our executive officers in its sole determination. Our Board reserves the right to pay our executives or any future executives a salary, and/or issue them shares of stock issued in consideration for services rendered and/or to award incentive bonuses which are linked to our performance, as well as to the individual executive officers performance. This package may also include long-term stock-based compensation to certain executives, which is intended to align the performance of our executives with our long-term business strategies. Additionally, the Board reserves the right to grant performance base stock options in the future, if the Board in its sole determination believes such grants would be in the best interests of the Company.\nIncentive Bonus\nThe Board may grant incentive bonuses to our executive officers and/or future executive officers in its sole discretion, if the Board believes such bonuses are in the Companys best interest, after analyzing our current business objectives and growth, if any, and the amount of revenue and profits we are able to generate each month, both of which are a direct result of the actions and ability of such executives.\nLong-Term, Stock Based Compensation\nIn order to attract, retain and motivate executive talent necessary to support the Companys long-term business strategy we may award our executives and any future executives with long-term, stock-based compensation in the future, at the sole discretion of our Board, which we do not currently have any immediate plans to award.\nDirector Compensation\nHistorically, the Companys directors have not received compensation for their service. In the future, we expect that a board committee will review and make recommendations to the board regarding compensation of directors, including equity-based plans. We will reimburse our non-employee directors for reasonable travel expenses incurred in attending board and committee meetings. We also intend to allow our non-employee directors to participate in any equity compensation plans that we adopt in the future. Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of November 1, 2023 by:\n\u25cf each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u25cf each of our current named executive officers and directors that beneficially own shares of our common stock; and\n\u25cf all our executive officers and directors as a group.\nInformation with respect to beneficial ownership has been furnished by each director, named executive officer or 5% or more stockholder, as the case may be.

(the Company) as of July 31, 2023, and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended July 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended May 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has a working capital deficit, has generated net losses since its inception and further losses are anticipated. The Company requires additional funds to meet its obligations and the costs of its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. We have determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ Hudgens CPA, PLLC\nwww.hudgenscpas.com\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2021.\nHouston, Texas\nNovember 1, 2023\nOpenLocker Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nJuly 31, 2023\nJuly 31, 2022\nAssets\nCurrent Assets\nCash\n$ 15,539\n$ 607,135\nAccounts receivable\n8,000\n-\nTotal Current Assets\n23,539\n607,135\nWebsite -

(OL)\n***\nDelaware\n*\nFormerly known as Descrypto Holdings, Inc., entity changed name on December 5, 2022.\n**\nEntity was acquired in a reverse merger on July 29, 2021.\n***\nSee Note 6 regarding the acquisition of Open Locker, Inc. on May 31, 2022.\nGoing Concern and Managements Plans\nThese unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.\nAs reflected in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements, for the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company had:\n\u25cf Net loss of $7,425,932; and\n\u25cf Net cash used in operations of $978,976\nAdditionally, at July 31, 2023, the Company had:\n\u25cf Accumulated deficit of $10,134,087\n\u25cf Stockholders deficit of $97,676; and\n\u25cf Working capital deficit of $100,855\nWe manage liquidity risk by reviewing, on an ongoing basis, our sources of liquidity and capital requirements. The Company had cash on hand of $15,539 at July 31, 2023. Although the Company intends to raise additional debt or equity capital, the Company expects to continue to incur significant losses from operations and have negative cash flows from operating activities for the near-term. These losses could be significant as operations ramp up along with continuing expenses related to compensation, professional fees, and regulatory are incurred.\nOPENLOCKER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2023 AND 2022\nThe Company has incurred significant losses since its inception and has not demonstrated an ability to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitable operations. There can be no assurance that profitable operations will ever be achieved, or if achieved, could be sustained on a continuing basis. In making this assessment we performed a comprehensive analysis of our current circumstances including: our financial position, our cash flows and cash usage forecasts for the twelve months ended July 31, 2023, and our current capital structure including equity-based instruments and our obligations and debts.\nThe Company has satisfied its obligations from the issuance of common stock; however, there is no assurance that such successful efforts will continue during the twelve months subsequent to the date these consolidated financial statements are issued.\nIf the Company does not obtain additional capital, the Company will be required to reduce the scope of its business development activities or cease operations. The Company continues to explore obtaining additional capital financing and the Company is closely monitoring its cash balances, cash needs, and expense levels.\nThese factors create substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern within the twelve-month period subsequent to the date that these unaudited consolidated financial statements are issued. The unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.\nManagements strategic plans include the following:\n\u25cf Pursuing additional capital raising opportunities,\n\u25cf Continuing to explore and execute prospective partnering or distribution opportunities\u037e\n\u25cf Identifying strategic acquisitions; and\n\u25cf Identifying unique market opportunities that represent potential positive short-term cash flow.\nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial statements (U.S. GAAP)\nOPENLOCKER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2023 AND 2022\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThese unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (the FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations which requires recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent assets and liabilities, at their respective fair values on the date of acquisition.\nBusiness Segments and Concentrations\nThe Company uses the management approach to identify its reportable segments. The management approach requires companies to report segment financial information consistent with information used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the basis for identifying the Companys reportable segments. The Company manages its business as a single operating segment.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and those estimates may be material.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company accounts for financial instruments under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. ASC 820 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, based on the Companys principal or, in absence of a principal, most advantageous market for the specific asset or liability.\nThe Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy to classify and disclose all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, in periods subsequent to their initial measurement. The hierarchy requires the Company to use observable inputs when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs, when determining fair value.\nOPENLOCKER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2023 AND 2022\nThe three tiers are defined as follows:\n\u25cf Level 1 -Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;\n\u25cf Level 2-Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly in the marketplace for identical or similar assets and liabilities; and\n\u25cf Level 3-Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions.\nThe determination of fair value and the assessment of a measurements placement within the hierarchy requires judgment. Level 3 valuations often involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Level 3 valuations may require the use of various cost, market, or income valuation methodologies applied to unobservable management estimates and assumptions. Managements assumptions could vary depending on the asset or liability valued and the valuation method used. Such assumptions could include estimates of prices, earnings, costs, actions of market participants, market factors, or the weighting of various valuation methods. The Company may also engage external advisors to assist us in determining fair value, as appropriate.\nAlthough the Company believes that the recorded fair value of our financial instruments is appropriate, these fair values may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.\nThe Companys financial instruments, including cash, and accounts payable and accrued expenses, are carried at historical cost. At July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the carrying amounts of these instruments approximated their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\nASC 825-10 Financial Instruments allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (fair value option). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding financial instruments.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nFor purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the purchase date and money market accounts to be cash equivalents.\nAt July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the Company did not have any cash equivalents.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents in the event of default by the financial institutions to the extent account balances exceed the amount insured by the FDIC, which is $250,000. At July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not experience any losses on cash balances in excess of FDIC insured limits.\nOPENLOCKER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2023 AND 2022\nInvestment\nThe Company owns 150,000 shares of iGrow Systems Inc. The shares were valued at cost $15,000 ($0.10/share). The investment was recorded on the Companys balance sheet using the cost method of accounting.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company determined that the value of the investment was non-recoverable and has recorded an impairment loss of $15,000 in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill and Impairment\nIn financial reporting, goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually (July 31) or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We assess potential impairment by considering present economic conditions as well as future expectations. All assessments of goodwill impairment are conducted at the individual reporting unit level.\nThe Company uses qualitative factors according to ASC 350-20-35-3 to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company determined that given various negative financial indicators (quantitative and qualitative), goodwill of $2,943,874 was fully impaired and recorded as a component of other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. There were no impairments recorded for the year ended July 31, 2022. See Note 6.\nIntangible Assets and Impairment\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually. The Company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company determined that given various negative financial indicators (quantitative and qualitative), intangible assets (net of amortization) of $1,916,270 was fully impaired and recorded as a component of other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. There were no impairments recorded for the year ended July 31, 2022. See Note 7.\nOPENLOCKER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2023 AND 2022\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nManagement evaluates the recoverability of the Companys identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists, in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360-10-35-15 Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.\nIf impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.\nThere were no impairment losses for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nExpenditures for repair and maintenance which do not materially extend the useful lives of property and equipment are charged to operations. When property or equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts with the resulting gain or loss reflected in operations.\nManagement reviews the carrying value of its property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\nThere were no impairment losses for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOPENLOCKER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2023 AND 2022\nOperating Lease\nFrom time to time, we may enter into operating lease or sub-lease agreements, including our corporate headquarters. We account for leases in accordance with ASC Topic 842: Leases, which requires a lessee to utilize the right-of-use model and to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases are classified as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of operations. In addition, a lessor is required to classify leases as either sales-type, financing or operating. A lease will be treated as a sale if it transfers all of the risks and rewards, as well as control of the underlying asset, to the lessee. If risks and rewards are conveyed without the transfer of control, the lease is treated as financing. If the lessor does not convey risk and rewards or control, the lease is treated as operating. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception and record the lease in our financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor.\nRight-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term. Lease right-of-use assets and liabilities at commencement are initially measured at the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement to determine the present value of lease payments except when an implicit interest rate is readily determinable. We determine our incremental borrowing rate based on market sources including relevant industry data.\nWe may have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor perspective with the exception of direct sales-type leases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease components and associated lease component and, the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease.\nWe have elected not to present short-term leases on the balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease inception and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise. All other lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nOPENLOCKER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2023 AND 2022\nOur leases, where we are the lessee, do not include an option to extend the lease term. Our lease does not include an option to terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease term would include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.\nLease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense, included as a component of general and administrative expenses, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nCertain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate, our lease has no stated increase, payments were fixed at lease inception. We calculate the present value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date. Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred.\nSee Note 10.\nRevenue Recognition\nOpenLocker generates revenue from two main sources, our collectibles and sponsorship revenues.\nRevenue is recognized in accordance with ASC No. 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company recognizes revenue when its performance obligations are complete, which occurs at a point in time related to the transfer of a digital access pass or sale of a sponsorship to its customer (final or ultimate end-user purchaser/collector). Currently, all revenue streams contain a single performance obligation. There are no penalties for contract termination by either party.\nCollectibles\nAll payments are received from third-party payment processing providers. The Company receives payments from sales on its primary marketplace (Shopify site) as well as two other sources. Each of these sources of payment relate to the completion of a single performance obligation completed at a point in time, which occurs upon the transfer of a digital access pass and where no further performance obligations are required. At the point of sale, the Company grants all rights in the intellectual property to the customer.\nOPENLOCKER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2023 AND 2022\nPayments from customers (all paid in cash) are received as follows:\n\u25cf Shopify payouts from credit/debit cards transactions typically occur 2-3 days after date of sale; and\n\u25cf PayPal payments are received same day\nShipping fees collected from customers for physical collectibles are included with revenues received from Shopify payouts. Prior to the product shipping, any amounts received in advance are accounted for as contract liabilities (deferred revenue).\nThe Company controls the collectibles via digital access pass prior to a sale and acts as the principal in these transactions.\nSponsorships\nThe Company generates revenues from sponsorship arrangements, in which the customer sponsors an athlete, event or sports team. In exchange for the sponsorship, the customer receives specified brand recognition and other benefits over a set period of time and will recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the time period specified in the contract. Related performance obligations for sponsorship arrangements are recognized ratably over this period of time.\nThe excess of amounts contractually due over the amounts of sponsorship revenue recognized are included on the consolidated balance sheets as contract liabilities (deferred revenues). Contractually due, but unpaid sponsorship revenue is included in accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAt July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had contract liabilities of $10,050 and $0, respectively.\nFor the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $25,450 and $0, respectively, of sponsorship revenues from three customers.\nOPENLOCKER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2023 AND 2022\nThe following represents the Companys disaggregation of revenues for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022:\nSchedule of Disaggregation of Revenue\nYear Ended July 31,\nRevenues Revenue % of Revenues Revenue % of Revenues\nCollectibles $ 55,729 69 % $ 208 100 %\nSponsorship 25,450 31 % - 0 %\nTotal Revenues $ 81,179 100 % $ 208 100 %\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold primarily include web development and graphic design costs.\nSoftware Development Costs\nInternal-use software development costs are accounted for in accordance with ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software. The costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as research and development costs as incurred.\nOnce an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs incurred to develop internal-use software are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software (typically three to five years).\nMaintenance and enhancement costs, including those costs in the post-implementation stages, are typically expensed as incurred, unless such costs relate to substantial upgrades and enhancements to the software that result in added functionality, in which case the costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software.\nThe Company reviews the carrying value for impairment whenever facts and circumstances exist that would suggest that assets might be impaired or that the useful lives should be modified. Amortization expense related to capitalized internal-use software development costs will be included in cost of goods sold in the statements of operations.\nFor the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company expensed $247,181 and $46,667, respectively, in software development costs.\nOPENLOCKER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2023 AND 2022\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income tax using the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company follows the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes using the provisions of ASC 740 Income Taxes. Using that guidance, tax positions initially need to be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. As of July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the Company had no uncertain tax positions that qualify for either recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in other expense. No interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions were recorded for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs are included as a component of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nFor the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company expensed $131,384 and $16,722, respectively, in marketing and advertising costs.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for our stock-based compensation under ASC 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation using the fair value-based method. Under this method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. This guidance establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges it equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments.\nOPENLOCKER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2023 AND 2022\nWhen determining fair value of stock options, the Company considers the following assumptions in the Black-Scholes model:\n\u25cf Exercise price\n\u25cf Expected dividends\n\u25cf Expected volatility\n\u25cf Risk-free interest rate; and\n\u25cf Expected life of option\nStock Warrants\nIn connection with certain financing (debt or equity), consulting and collaboration arrangements, the Company may issue warrants to purchase shares of its common stock. The outstanding warrants are standalone instruments that are not puttable or mandatorily redeemable by the holder and are classified as equity awards. The Company measures the fair value of warrants issued for compensation using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as of the measurement date. However, for warrants issued that meet the definition of a derivative liability, fair value is determined based upon the use of a binomial pricing model.\nWarrants issued in conjunction with the issuance of common stock are initially recorded at fair value as a reduction in additional paid-in capital of the common stock issued. All other warrants (for services) are recorded at fair value and expensed over the requisite service period or at the date of issuance if there is not a service period.\nBasic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share\nPursuant to ASC 260-10-45, basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the periods presented.\nDiluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares may consist of common stock issuable for stock options and warrants (using the treasury stock method), convertible notes and common stock issuable. These common stock equivalents may be dilutive in the future. In the event of a net loss, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share since the effect of the potential common stock equivalents upon conversion would be anti-dilutive.\nOPENLOCKER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2023 AND 2022\nFor the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had the following potentially dilutive equity securities:\nSchedule of Potentially Dilutive Equity Securities\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\nSeries A, convertible preferred stock (1 to 1,000 into common stock) 58,415,000 35,520,000\nSeries A, convertible preferred stock (1 to 1,000 into common stock) 58,415,000 35,520,000\nStock options (exercise prices $0.12 - $0.70/share) 2,219,368 864,489\nWarrants (exercise price $1/share) 1,425,000 -\nTotal common stock equivalents 62,059,368 36,384,489\nRelated Parties\nParties are considered to be related to the Company if the parties, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control, are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal with if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nChanges to accounting principles are established by the FASB in the form of Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) to the ASC Codification. We consider the applicability and impact of all ASUs on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders equity, cash flows, or presentation thereof. Management has evaluated all recent accounting pronouncements issued through the date these financial statements were available to be issued and found no recent accounting pronouncements issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, when adopted, will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (ASU 2022-02), which eliminates the accounting guidance on troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) for creditors in ASC 310, Receivables (Topic 310), and requires entities to provide disclosures about current period gross write-offs by year of origination. Also, ASU 2022-02 updates the requirements related to accounting for credit losses under ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), and adds enhanced disclosures for creditors with respect to loan refinancings and restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. ASU 2022-02 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2022-02 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nOPENLOCKER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2023 AND 2022\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no material effect on the consolidated results of operations, stockholders equity, or cash flows.\nNote 3 - Website\nThe Companys website consisted of the following:\nSchedule of Companys Website\nEstimated Useful\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022 Lives (Years)\nWebsite $ 10,836 $ 10,836\nAccumulated amortization 7,935 4,767\nWebsite - net $ 2,901 $ 6,069\nAmortization expense for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 was $3,168 and $3,376, respectively.\nThese amounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nOPENLOCKER HOLDINGS, INC.

The valuation used a discounted cash flow model and the Multiple Period Excess Earnings Method. This valuation was necessary as the Company was not operating in an active market where.\nWe made an initial allocation of the purchase price at the date of acquisition based on our understanding of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

The Company and the student athlete have agreed to split the revenue from the initial sale.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2023 AND 2022\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities at July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are approximately as follows:\nSchedule of Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\nAmortization of intangible asset $ (68,000 ) $ (13,000 )\nAmortization of website - (1,000 )\nAmortization of ROU lease (1,000 ) -\nShare based payments 240,000 (540,000 )\nNet operating loss carryforwards (341,000 ) (98,000 )\nTotal deferred tax assets (170,000 ) (652,000 )\nLess: valuation allowance 170,000 652,000\nNet deferred tax asset recorded $ - $ -\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are computed by applying the federal and state income tax rates in effect to the gross amounts of temporary differences and other tax attributes, such as net operating loss carryforwards. In assessing if the deferred tax assets will be realized, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of these deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which these deductible temporary differences reverse.\nThe Company, after considering all available evidence, fully reserved its deferred tax assets since it is more likely than not that such benefits may be realized in future periods. The Company has not yet established that it can generate taxable income. The Company will continue to evaluate its deferred tax assets to determine whether any changes in circumstances could affect the realization of their future benefit. If it is determined in future periods that portions of the Companys deferred tax assets satisfy the realization standards, the valuation allowance will be reduced accordingly.\nOPENLOCKER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2023 AND 2022\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2023, the valuation allowance increased by approximately $485,000. The total valuation allowance results from the Companys estimate of its uncertainty in being unable to recover its net deferred tax assets.\nAt July 31, 2023, the Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, which are available to offset future taxable income, of approximately $1,379,000 (approximately $338,000 at the blended tax rate). The Company is in the process of analyzing their NOL and has not determined if the Company has had any change of control issues that could limit the future use of these NOLs. NOL carryforwards that were generated after 2017 may only be used to offset 80% of taxable income and are carried forward indefinitely. NOLs generated prior to December 31, 2017 expire through 2037.\nThese carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and similar state provisions if the Company experienced one or more ownership changes which would limit the amount of NOL and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382 and 383, results from transactions increasing ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of the corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three- year period. The Company has not completed an IRC Section 382/383 analysis. If a change in ownership were to have occurred, NOL and tax credit carryforwards could be eliminated or restricted.\nIf eliminated, the related asset would be removed from the deferred tax asset schedule with a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance. Due to the existence of the valuation allowance, limitations created by future ownership changes, if any, are not expected to impact the Companys effective tax rate.\nThe Company files corporate income tax returns in the United States and State of Florida jurisdictions. Due to the Companys net operating loss posture, all tax years are open and subject to income tax examination by tax authorities. The Companys policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as tax expense.\nAt July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, there are no unrecognized tax benefits, and there were no significant accruals for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits or tax penalties.\nNote 12 - Subsequent Events\nSubsequent to July 31, 2023, the Company reflects the following:\nNote Payable\nIn August 2023, the Company executed a note payable with a third party for $150,000. The note bears interest at 10% and is due August 2024.\nNotes Payable - Related Parties\nIn August 2023, the Company executed notes payable with certain officers and directors for $80,000. The notes bear interest at 10% and are due August 2024.\nStock Issued for Services\nThe Company issued 704,644 shares of common stock for services rendered, having a fair value of $202,678 ($0.2479 - $0.44/share), based upon the quoted closing trading price."
