    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\na. BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT\nPismo Coast Village, Inc., the \"Registrant\" or the \"Company,\" was incorporated under the laws of the State of California on April 2, 1975. The Company's sole business is owning and operating Pismo Coast Village RV Resort, a recreational vehicle resort (hereinafter the \"Resort\") in Pismo Beach, California. The Resort has continued to enhance its business by upgrading facilities and services to better serve customers.\nb. BUSINESS OF ISSUER\nThe Company is engaged in only one business, namely, the ownership and operation of the Resort. The Company generates revenue from rental of camping sites, recreational vehicle storage, recreational vehicle repair and retail sales from a general store and recreational vehicle parts store. Accordingly, all of the revenues, operating profit (loss) and identifiable assets of the Company are attributable to a single industry segment.\nPismo Coast Village RV Resort is a full-service 400-space recreational vehicle resort. Its Resort operations include site rentals, RV storage business, video arcade, laundromat, and other income sources related to the operation. The retail operations include a general store, RV parts store, and RV repair shop. In addition, the Company has a recreation department that provides a summer season youth program and recreational equipment rentals.\nPUBLIC AND SHAREHOLDER USERS\nThe present policy of the Company is to offer each shareholder the opportunity for 45 nights of free use of sites at the Resort; 25 nights may be used during prime time and 20 nights during non-prime time. The free use of sites by shareholders is managed by designating the nights of the year as prime time and non-prime time. A prime-time night is one that is most in demand, for example, Memorial Day Weekend and the period from June 1 until Labor Day. Non-prime time is that time with the least demand. Each shareholder is furnished annually a calendar that designates the prime and non-prime time nights; it also provides a schedule of when reservations can be made and the procedure for making reservations. Shareholder's free use of sites average approximately 21% to 24% annually (refer to Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, page 9).\nSEASONAL ASPECTS OF BUSINESS\nThe business of the Company is seasonal and is concentrated during prime days of the year which are defined as follows: President's Day Weekend, Easter week, Memorial Day Weekend, summer vacation months, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Weekend and Christmas vacation.\nWORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS\nBy accumulating reserves during the prime seasons, the Company is able generally to meet its working capital needs during off-season. Industry practice is to accumulate funds during the prime season, and use such funds, as necessary, in the off-season. The Company has arranged, but not used, a $500,000 line of credit to ensure funds are available, if necessary, in the off-season.\nCOMPETITION\nThe Company is in competition with nine other RV parks located within a five-mile radius. Since its property is the only property located adjacent to the beach, it has a competitive edge. The Company is recognized as a recreational vehicle resort rather than a park because of its upgraded facilities and amenities, which include a restaurant, general store, 66 channels of satellite TV, high-speed wireless internet service throughout the property, a heated pool, a miniature golf course and a recreational program. The Resort is noted for its ability to provide full service, which includes RV storage and RV repair and service. The Resort is consistently given high ratings by industry travel guides based on resort appearance, facilities offered, and recreational programs. In November 2007, Pismo Coast Village RV Resort was awarded the designation of 2007/2008 RV Park of the Year, Large Park Category, by the National Association of RV Parks and Campgrounds (ARVC), which has a membership of more than 3,900 properties. Pismo Coast Village RV Resort also received national Park of the Year honors in 1999, 1997, and 1995. In fiscal year 2004, Pismo Coast Village RV Resort was awarded the designation of RV Park of the Year - Mega Park Category 2004 by the California Travel Parks Association (CTPA), now known as the California Association of RV Parks and Campgrounds (CalARVC).\nCompetition for the tourist market is strong between the cities on the Central Coast of California. Resort management and staff are involved with the City of Pismo Beach, Chamber of Commerce, Conference and Visitors Bureau, and are major sponsors in cooperative events and advertising. The Resort continues to market off-season discounts and place advertisements in trade publications and industry directories. In addition, the Company places its brochure with companies selling or renting recreational vehicles and has found the Resort's website and social media to be very effective. The marketing program also targets groups and clubs by offering group discounts, meeting facilities, and catering services. The Company's marketing plan was funded $58,944 for fiscal year 2022, which was developed out of operating revenues. The major source of the Company's business is repeat business, which has been developed by attention to good customer service and providing quality recreational facilities.\nENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION\nThe Company is affected by federal, state and local antipollution laws and regulations. Due to the nature of its business operations (camping, RV storage and small retail store sales), the discharge of materials into the environment is not considered to be of a significant concern, and the EPA has not designated the Company as a potentially responsible party for clean up of hazardous waste.\nThe main property of the Resort is located within the boundaries of those lands under the review and purview of the Coastal Commission of the State of California and the City of Pismo Beach. The water and sewer systems are serviced by the City of Pismo Beach. The Company was subject to state and federal regulations regarding the fiscal year 1996 reconstruction of an outflow structure that empties into Pismo Creek at the north boundary of the Resort. Because the Resort is within the wetlands area, the California Coastal Commission required permits for repair and construction to be reviewed by the following agencies: City of Pismo Beach, State Lands Commission, Regional Water Quality Board, State of California, California Department of Fish and Game, State Department of Parks and Recreation and the Army Corps of Engineers.\nEMPLOYEES\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company employed approximately 71 people, with 23 of these on a part-time basis and 42 on a full-time basis. Due to the seasonal nature of the business, additional staff is needed during peak periods and fewer during the off-season. Staffing levels during the fiscal year ranged from approximately 64 employees to 71 employees. Management considers its labor relations to be good.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nThe Company has remained conservative when considering rates and rate increases. As a result of experiencing increasing operational expenses and conducting a local comparative rate study, the Board of Directors (Board) voted to increase all trailer towing fees $10 per tow effective August 1, 2022. The Board also voted at the May 2021 meeting to increase all nightly rates $5 per night effective January 1, 2022. It is anticipated the proposed rates will continue to market site usage at its highest value and not negatively impact the Company's ability to capture an optimum market share.\nc. REPORTS TO SECURITY HOLDERS\nPismo Coast Village, Inc. files quarterly reports, an annual report, and periodic reports, providing the public with current information about the Company and its operations with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe Company makes available on its website, www.pismocoastvillage.com, access to its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe public may read and copy any materials filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, on official business days during the hours of 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., at the SEC's Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, N.

The SEC maintains an internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy statements, and other information that the Company files electronically with the SEC.   ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nThe Company's principal asset consists of the Resort, which is located at 165 South Dolliver Street in Pismo Beach, California. The Resort is built on a 26-acre site and includes 400 campsites with full hookups and nearby restrooms with showers and common facilities, such as a video arcade, recreation hall, restaurant, general store, swimming pool, laundromat, and three playgrounds.\nIn 1980, the Company purchased a 2.1-acre parcel of real property located at 2250 22nd Street, Oceano, California, at a price of $66,564. The property is being used by the Company as a storage facility for recreational vehicles. The storage capacity of this lot is approximately 121 units. On October 20, 2014, the Company entered into a long-term lease with Verizon Wireless for the installation of a cell tower. The lease term is for five (5) years with up to four (4) additional five (5) year terms unless lessee terminates the lease at the end of the current term.\nIn 1981, the Company exercised an option and purchased a 3.3-acre parcel located at 424 South Dolliver Street, Pismo Beach, California, at a price of $300,000. The property, which previously had been leased by the Company, is used primarily as a recreational vehicle storage yard. The storage capacity of this lot is approximately 120 units. On June 6, 2016, the Company entered into a long-term lease with Verizon Wireless for the installation of a cell tower. The lease term is for five (5) years with up to four (4) additional five (5) year terms unless lessee terminates the lease at the end of the current term.\nIn 1988, the Company purchased approximately 0.6 acres of property at 180 South Dolliver Street, Pismo Beach, California, across the street from the main property, consisting of a large building with a storefront and one large maintenance bay in the rear. Also, on the property is a smaller garage-type building with three parking stalls. The Company enlarged its recreational vehicle repair operation, added RV storage for approximately eleven units and developed the storefront into an RV parts store. The property was purchased for $345,000, of which $300,000 was financed and paid in full during fiscal year 1997.\nOn December 31, 1998, the Company closed escrow on a parcel of property located at 1295 Sand Dollar Avenue, Oceano, California, to be developed as an additional RV storage facility. The 5.5-acre property is located adjacent to existing Company RV storage. On October 14, 1999, construction was completed, and the Company received County approval to occupy the premises. The property was purchased for $495,000, of which $395,000 was financed and paid in full in July 2000. Development cost amounted to $195,723 and was allocated from operational cash flow. Storage capacity for this property is approximately 408 units and is currently full.\nOn February 28, 2003, the Company closed escrow on a parcel of property to be developed as an additional RV storage facility. The 4.7-acre property is located on Fountain Avenue in Oceano, California, and was purchased for $650,000, of which $500,000 was financed. The note on this property was paid off in September 2005. The construction permit granted by the County of San Luis Obispo was contingent upon permit approval by the California Coastal Commission. In January 2006, the Commission denied the permit based on wetland conditions. The property is currently being considered for another use or possibly liquidation.\nDue to the continued demand for RV storage and the denial of the aforementioned permit, the Board of Directors elected to purchase additional property. On January 11, 2006, the Company closed escrow on a six-acre property located at 974 Sheridan Road, Arroyo Grande, California, previously developed as an RV storage facility. The purchase price was $2.1 million, and included approximately 80 existing storage customers. This property had been permitted and developed the previous year, and is considered in good condition with a capacity of approximately 229 units.\nOn April 6, 2006, the Company purchased the 2.2-acre property located at 2030 Front Street in Oceano, California, that it previously rented from Union Pacific Railroad for RV storage. The purchase price was $925,000 and the condition is considered good. The lot is operating at full capacity with 181 units.\nOn May 9, 2008, the Company closed escrow on a 19.55-acre property located at 2180 Arriba Place in Arroyo Grande, California, to be developed for RV storage. The purchase price was $3.1 million for the undeveloped land. The Company received a development permit through the County of San Luis Obispo Planning Commission. The development was completed in May 2010, and the storage capacity is expected to be approximately 900 units. On January 21, 2013, the Company entered into a long-term lease with Verizon Wireless for the installation of a cell tower. The lease term is for five (5) years with up to four (4) additional five (5) year terms unless lessee terminates the lease at the end of the current term.\nOn May 20, 2015, the Company closed escrow on a one-acre property located at 2096 Nipomo Street in Oceano, California, to be developed as an RV Repair and Service facility. The purchase price was $425,000 and required the demolition of a two-story residence. The Company successfully expanded the usable property area by seeking road abandonment. On September 1, 2017, the Company received a Minor Use Permit with conditions from San Luis Obispo County. Construction was completed and the Certificate of Occupancy was received from the County of San Luis Obispo in March of 2021.\nThere is no deferred maintenance on any of the Resort's facilities. The Company's facilities are in good condition and adequate to meet the needs of the shareholder users as well as the public users. The Company continues to develop sufficient revenue from general public sites sales to support a continued positive maintenance program and to meet the demands of shareholders use of free sites.\nManagement considers the Company's insurance policies offer adequate coverage for risk and liability exposure.\n1. TRAILER STORAGE YARDS\nIn 1986, the Company leased a parcel of land 100 feet wide by 960 feet long, located at 2030 Front Street in Oceano, California, from the Union Pacific Railroad Corporation. The property is being used by the Company as a storage facility for recreational vehicles. Capital improvements in the amount of $40,000 were made to this property, which provides storage for approximately 180 units. On July 29, 2005, Union Pacific Railroad Corporation sold the property to the Weyrick Family Trust, who, after entering into a five-year lease, agreed to sell the property to the Company for $925,000. This transaction was completed April 6, 2006.\nAssociated with the previously mentioned property, and included within the fenced storage perimeter, is the lease of a ten-foot by 960-foot section belonging to Union Pacific Railroad. This lease also allows for the Company's fence to encroach upon the lessor's property. This annual lease is currently $7,379, with a 3% automatic annual increase.\nIn 1991, the Company developed a lease for a five-acre RV storage lot at the Oceano Airport clear zone as storage for approximately 310 RVs. This lot, which is located at 1909 Delta Lane in Oceano, was developed to replace a 100-unit storage lot that was closed when the lease was not renewed. Construction was completed in January 1992 and capital improvements in the amount of $330,768 were made to this property of which $300,000 was financed and paid in full during fiscal year 1997. The original lease on the storage lot was for five years and the Company executed a third five-year option with the County of San Luis Obispo that expired December 31, 2006. In response to the Company's request for another five-year extension, the County has answered that, until the Oceano Airport Master Plan is updated, the lease will be a month-to-month holdover.\nOn June 2, 2020, the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors voted to approve a lease with the Company following the completion of the Oceano Drainage project. The initial lease term is for two years and may be extended for four additional and successive two-year terms. The lease was extended in June of 2022. The monthly lease is currently $3,924 with an annual adjustment based on Consumer Price Index published in July.\nThe Resort leases out areas to other companies to ensure that the best service and equipment are available for guest use or creates cash flow for the Company. These areas are leased from the Company pursuant to the herein below described leases.\n1. RECREATIONAL ARCADE AGREEMENT WITH COIN AMUSEMENTS, INC.\nThis agreement is dated November 1, 2021, and pursuant to this agreement, the Company granted Coin Amusements, Inc. the concession to operate various coin-operated game units at the Resort.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following analysis discusses the Company's financial condition as of September 30, 2022, compared with September 30, 2021. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statement and the related notes to the financial statement and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nCertain information included herein contains statements that may be considered forward-looking statements, such as statements relating to anticipated expenses, capital spending and financing sources. Such forward-looking information involves important risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect anticipated results in the future and, accordingly, such results may differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made herein. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those relating to competitive industry conditions, California tourism and weather conditions, dependence on existing management, leverage and debt service, the regulation of the recreational vehicle industry, domestic or global economic conditions, and changes in federal or state tax laws or the administration of such laws.\nOVERVIEW\nPismo Coast Village, Inc. operates as a 400-space recreational vehicle resort. The Company includes additional business operations to provide its users with a full range of services expected of a recreational resort. These services include a store, video arcade, laundromat, recreational vehicle repair, RV parts shop and an RV storage operation.\nThe Company is authorized to issue 1,800 shares of one class, all with equal voting rights and all being without par value. Transfers of shares are restricted by Company bylaws. One such restriction is that transferees must acquire shares with intent to hold the same for the purpose of enjoying camping rights and other benefits to which a shareholder is entitled. Each share of stock is intended to provide the shareholder with the opportunity for 45 nights of free site use per year. However, if the Company is unable to generate sufficient funds from the public, the Company may be required to charge shareholders for services.\nManagement is charged with the task of developing sufficient funds to operate the Resort through site sales to general public guests by allocating a minimum of 175 sites to general public use and allocating a maximum of 225 sites for shareholder free use. The other service centers are expected to generate sufficient revenue to support themselves and/or produce a profit.\nThe Company continues to promote and depend upon recreational vehicle camping as the primary source of revenue. The rental of campsites to the general public provides income to cover expenses, complete capital improvements, and allow shareholders up to 45 free nights camping annually. Additional revenues come from RV storage and spotting, RV service and repair, on-site convenience store, and other ancillary activities such as laundromat, arcade, and bike rental.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic. In response, the County of San Luis Obispo followed by the Governor of California issued a Shelter at Home order effective March 19, 2020, requiring certain non-essential businesses to temporarily close to the public. The Company began canceling reservations on March 19 and closed the park on March 23. The resort remained closed until May 22, 2020 at which time the County of San Luis Obispo permitted occupancy to fifty percent. On June 5, 2020, the County of San Luis Obispo allowed lodging businesses to operate at full capacity with restrictions on amenities.\nThe RVing public actively seeks accommodations on the Central Coast despite volatile fuel prices and personal financial uncertainties. RVing offers an affordable outdoor recreational experience, and the Company provides quality facilities and services in a highly popular location. Site occupancy for fiscal year 2020 was down 18.0%, following the previous years occupancy, primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19. Revenues from ancillary operations, such as the General Store, RV service, laundromat, arcade, and bike rental, were significantly decreased due to the COVID-19 closure and ongoing impact.\nFollowing the full resort reopening on June 5, 2020, the company experienced multiple months of record occupancy, including fiscal year 2021 reflecting record occupancy. This occupancy directly impacted the increase of revenue in all segments of the company. As the COVID-19 pandemic eased, fiscal year 2022 reflected resort activity returning to pre-pandemic levels. Site occupancy, while still strong decreased by 3,185 or 2.5% occupied site nights when comparing fiscal year 2022 to 2021.\nRV storage continues to provide a significant portion of the Companys revenue. RV storage provides numerous benefits to the customer including: no stress of towing, no need to own a tow vehicle, use of RV by multiple family members, and convenience.\nOngoing investment in Resort improvements has assured Resort guests and shareholders a top quality, up-to-date facility. This quality and pride of ownership was evident when the National Association of RV Parks and Campgrounds Park of the Year was awarded to the Resort for 2007 - 2008. In addition, in 2008 the Resort was the only industry rated \"A\" park in California for customer satisfaction based on internet visitor surveys collected nationally by Guest Reviews. The Resort also received the Guest Reviews A rated park recognition for the years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and one of 30 parks nationally in 2017. The Resort continues to enjoy high annual ratings from Good Sam receiving 9.5,10, and 8.5 out of 10 for years 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company's commitment to quality, value, and enjoyment is underscored by the business' success due to word of mouth and referrals from guests. In addition, investment for online marketing, ads in the leading national directories, and trade magazine advertising formulates most of the business-marketing plan.\nCURRENT OPERATING PLANS\nThe Board of Directors continues its previously established policy by adopting a stringent conservative budget for fiscal year 2023, which projects a positive cash flow of approximately $2,913,850 from operations. This projection is based on paid site occupancy reflecting similar occupancy as experienced in fiscal year 2022. The 2023 budget plan includes a $5 per night increase for all site rentals effective January 1, 2023. While the Company projects a positive cash flow, this cannot be assured for fiscal year 2023.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe business of the Company is seasonal and is concentrated on prime days of the year which are defined as follows: President's Day weekend, Easter week, Memorial Day weekend, summer vacation months, Labor Day weekend, Thanksgiving week, and Christmas/New Years week. There are no known trends that affect business or affect revenue.\nThe Company develops its income from two sources: (a) Resort Operations, consisting of revenues generated from RV site rentals, from RV storage space operations, and lease revenues from the laundromat, arcade, restaurant operations and property leases for cell tower communications facilities by third party lessees; and (b) Retail Operations, consisting of revenues from general store operations and from RV parts and service operations.\nWith the possibility of requiring additional funds for planned capital improvements and the winter season, the Company maintains a $500,000 Line of Credit to ensure funds will be available if required. In anticipation of future large projects, the Board of Directors has instructed management to build operational cash balances. The Company has no other liabilities to creditors other than current accounts payable arising from its normal day-to-day operations and advance Resort rental reservation deposits, none of which are in arrears.\nLIQUIDITY\nThe Company's policy is to use its ability to generate operating cash flow to meet its expected future needs for internal growth. The Company has continued to maintain sufficient cash so as to not require the use of a short-term line of credit during the off-season period, and the Company expects to be able to do so (although no assurance of continued cash flow can be given).\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,710,003 in 2022, compared to $3,001,405 for the 2021 fiscal year.\nDuring fiscal year 2022, capital investment of $247,870 was made that included Wi-Fi upgrade, surveillance cameras, new truck for security, new truck for RV Service, new backhoe, new outfall pumps and electrical panel, pool heater, and two golf carts. During fiscal year 2021, capital investment of $169,180 was made that included a new street sweeper, a garbage compactor container, and final construction on the RV shop. These projects were completed on time and within budget.\nFiscal year 2022's current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) of 3.82 increased from fiscal year 2021's current ratio of 3.06. The increase in current ratio is the result of increased cash and cash equivalents.\nWorking Capital increased to $8,499,386 at the end of fiscal year 2022, compared to $6,377,259 at the end of fiscal year 2021. This increase is primarily a result of increased cash and cash equivalents as a result of increased income from Resort operations and postponement of some capital projects.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND PLANNED EXPENDITURES\nThe Company plans capital expenditures up to $175,000 in fiscal year 2023 to further enhance the Resort facilities and services. This would include enhancing the resorts recreation amenities, upgrading RV Storage security cameras, replacing three maintenance golf carts, and purchasing a lowboy tilt-trailer. Funding for these projects is expected to come from normal operating cash flows and, if necessary, supplemented with outside financing. These capital expenditures are expected to increase the Resort's value to its shareholders and the general public.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYEAR-TO-YEAR COMPARISON\nRevenue: Operating revenue, interest and other income increased above the prior fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, by $784,748, or 8.0%.\nREVENUE BY SEGMENT\nOCCUPANCY\n% of Shareholder Site Use\n24.0%\n23.8%\n% of Paid Site Rental\n61.3%\n63.8%\n% Total Site Occupancy\n85.4%\n87.5%\n% of Storage Rental\n99.0%\n99.0%\nAverage Paid Site\n$\n75.67\n$\n68.98\nRESORT OPERATIONS\nSite Rental\n$\n6,775,065\n$\n6,421,329\nStorage Operations\n2,015,925\n1,895,295\nSupport Operations\n230,468\n188,275\nTotal\n9,021,458\n8,504,899\nRETAIL OPERATIONS\nStore\n682,091\n705,779\nRV Repair/Parts Store\n632,984\n600,228\nTotal\n1,315,075\n1,306,007\nEmployee Retention Credit\n245,380\n-\nInterest Income\n14,822\nTOTAL REVENUE\n$\n10,596,635\n$\n9,811,887\nOccupancy rates on the previous table are calculated based on the quantity occupied as compared to the total sites available for occupancy (i.e., total occupied to number of total available). Average paid site is based on site revenue and paid sites. Resort support operations include revenues received from the arcade, laundromat, recreational activities, and other less significant sources.\n2022 COMPARED WITH 2021\nResort operations income increased $516,559, or 6.4%, primarily due to a $353,737 or 5.5% increase in site revenue reflecting a rate increase, and an increase of $120,631, or 6.4% from the RV Storage and towing program.\nRetail operations income increased $9,068, or 0.7%, primarily due to the RV Service department revenue increasing $32,756, or 5.5% above the previous year. The General Store revenue decreased $23,687, or 3.4% below the previous year. Both RV Service and the General Store were impacted by staffing challenges which included hiring qualified personnel, and in some cases reduction of operational hours. In an effort to maximize revenue, management continues to stock more appropriate items, more effectively merchandise, and pay greater attention to customer service. In addition, management has actively promoted the RV service and retail operation locally compared to previous years.\nInterest/Dividend Income increased $13,841, or 1411.0%, above the previous year. This increase was primarily due to a onetime interest payment on a property tax refund. Interest Expense decreased to $11,849 in 2022 compared to $13,545 the previous year.\nThe Company also received Employee Retention Credit payments totaling $245,380 in June of 2022.\nOperating Expenses increased $921,746, or 15.8%, as a result of labor and labor related expenses, insurance benefits, liability insurance, credit card service expense, vehicle expense, landscaping, accounting fees, credit card service expense, repairs and maintenance, storage lot maintenance, advertising, custodial supplies, office supplies, contributions, and Wi-Fi.\nMaintaining a conservative approach, most expense items were managed well below plan and in many categories below the previous year. The Board of Directors has directed management to continue maintenance projects as needed to provide a first-class resort for campers using recreational vehicles.\nIncome before provision for income tax of $2,728,039, a 21.4% decrease below last year, is reflective of increased operating expenses.\nNet income of $2,003,339 for fiscal year 2022 shows a decrease of $409,996, or 17.0%, below a net income of $2,413,335 in 2021. This decrease in net income is a reflection of the decrease in the income before provision for income tax.\nInflation has not had a significant impact on our profit position. The Company has increased rates, which have more than compensated for the rate of inflation.\nFuture operating results could be unfavorably impacted to the extent that changing prices result in lower discretionary income for customers and/or increased transportation costs to the Resort. In addition, increasing prices affect operations and liquidity by raising the replacement cost of property and equipment.\nFACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS:\nA number of factors, many of which are common to the lodging industry and beyond our control, could affect our business, including the following:\nincreased gas prices;\nincreased competition from other resorts in our market;\nincreases in operating costs due to inflation, labor costs, workers' compensation and healthcare related costs, utility costs, insurance and unanticipated costs such as acts of nature and their consequences and other factors that may not be offset by increased rates;\nchanges in interest rates, cost and terms of debt financing;\nchanges in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances;\nadverse effects of market conditions, which may diminish the desire for leisure travel; and\nadverse effects of a downturn in the leisure industry.\nThe leisure and travel business is seasonal and seasonal variations in revenue at our Resort can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenue.\nOur revenue is generally highest in the third and fourth quarters. Quarterly revenue also may be harmed by events beyond our control, such as extreme weather conditions, terrorist attacks or alerts, contagious diseases, economic factors, and other considerations affecting travel. To the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenue, we have to rely on our short-term line of credit for operations.\nIn the recent past, events beyond our control, including an economic slowdown and terrorism, harmed the operating performance of the leisure industry generally, and if these or similar events occur again, our operating and financial results may be harmed by declines in average daily rates or occupancy.\nCarrying our outstanding debt may harm our business and financial results by:\nrequiring us to use a substantial portion of our funds from operations to make required payments on principal and interest, which will reduce the amount of cash available to us for our operations and capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other purposes;\nmaking us more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns and reducing our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions;\nlimiting our ability to borrow more money for operations, capital expenditures or to finance acquisitions in the future; and\nrequiring us to sell one or more properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms, in order to make required payments of interest and principal.\nOur Resort has a need for ongoing renovations and potentially significant capital expenditures in connection with improvements, and the costs of such renovations or improvements may exceed our expectations.\nOccupancy and the rates we are able to charge are often affected by the maintenance and capital improvements at a resort, especially in the event that the maintenance of improvements is not completed on schedule, or if the improvements result in the closure of the General Store or a significant number of sites. The costs of capital expenditures we need to make could harm our financial condition and reduce amounts available for operations. These capital improvements may also give rise to additional risks including:\nconstruction cost overruns and delays;\na possible shortage of available cash to fund capital improvements and the related possibility that financing of these expenditures may not be available to us on favorable terms;\nuncertainties as to market demand or a loss of market demand after capital improvements have begun;\ndisruption in service and site availability causing reduced demand, occupancy, and rates; and\npossible environmental issues.\nWe rely on our executive officers and management team, the loss of whom could significantly harm our business.\nIn October 2021, our Chief Executive Officer/General Manager, Mr. Jay Jamison informed the Executive Committee that he intended to retire at the end of calendar year 2022. This provided the Company time to conduct a replacement search and allow the successor time to work with Mr. Jamison. On July 15, 2022, Ms. Lesley Marr began her career with Pismo Coast Village, Inc. as General Manager, and assumed full responsibility in that position on November 8, 2022.\nUpon retirement of our Chief Executive Officer/General Manager, Jay Jamison, our continued success will depend, to a significant extent, on the efforts and abilities of our new General Manager, Lesley Marr. Ms. Marr is important to our business and strategy and to the extent that were she to depart and is not replaced with an experienced substitute, Ms. Marrs departure could harm our operations, financial condition and operating results.\nUninsured and underinsured losses could harm our financial condition, and results of operations.\nVarious types of catastrophic issues, such as losses due to wars, terrorist acts, earthquakes, floods, pollution or environmental matters, generally are either uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be subject to insurance coverage limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments. Our Resort is located on the coast of California, which has been historically at greater risk to certain acts of nature (such as severe storms, fires and earthquakes).\nIn the event of a catastrophic loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover the full current market value or replacement cost of our lost properties. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in the Resort, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the Resort. In that event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any notes payable or other financial obligations related to the property. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors might also keep us from using insurance proceeds to replace or renovate the Resort after it has been damaged or destroyed. Under these circumstances, the insurance proceeds we receive might be inadequate to restore our economic position on the damaged or destroyed property.  ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nPismo Coast Village, Inc. is responsible for the information and representations contained in this report. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which we considered appropriate in the circumstances and include some amounts based on our best estimates and judgments. Other financial information in this report is consistent with these financial statements.\nOur accounting systems include controls designed to reasonably assure assets are safeguarded from unauthorized use or disposition and provide for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These systems are supplemented by the selection and training of qualified financial personnel and an organizational structure that provides for appropriate segregation of duties.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED\nPUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders\nPismo Coast Village, Inc.\n165 South Dolliver Street\nPismo Beach, California\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Pismo Coast Village, Inc. (the Company) (a California corporation) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of income and comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nIncome Taxes\nManagements estimates of the deferred tax assets, liabilities and provisions disclosed in Note 7 are based primarily on the differences between depreciation measurements on a tax basis versus GAAP basis, and timing of vacation expense recognition and shareholder site usage. We evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates of income tax provisions in determining that they are reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.\nWe identified the evaluation of the Companys income tax provisions as a critical audit matter because the application of tax law and timing of recognition of income tax expense and benefits is complex and involves subjective judgement.\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2005.\nBROWN ARMSTRONG ACCOUNTANCY CORPORATION\nAuditor Firm ID: #237\nBakersfield, California\nNovember 11, 2022\nPISMO COAST VILLAGE, INC.\nBALANCE SHEET\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nAssets\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,019,465\n$\n9,226,456\nCash Reserved for Capital Improvements\nand Deferred Maintenance\n9,566,367\n-\nAccounts receivable\n49,115\n36,764\nInventories\n216,842\n200,107\nPrepaid income taxes\n323,900\n-\nPrepaid expenses\n342,211\n16,657\nTotal current assets\n11,517,900\n9,479,984\nProperty and equipment\nNet of accumulated depreciation and amortization\n15,031,100\n15,262,544\nTotal assets\n$\n26,549,000\n$\n24,742,528\nLiabilities and Stockholders' Equity\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\n$\n265,444\n$\n319,576\nAccrued salaries and vacation\n432,187\n417,544\nRental deposits\n2,268,627\n2,244,848\nIncome taxes payable\n-\n60,000\nCurrent portion of capital lease obligations\n52,256\n60,757\nTotal current liabilities\n3,018,514\n3,102,725\nLong-term liabilities\nDeferred taxes\n424,900\n443,300\nCapital lease obligations, net of current portion\n104,382\n156,638\nTotal liabilities\n3,547,796\n3,702,663\nStockholders' equity\nCommon stock -

(the Company) is a recreational vehicle camping resort. Its business is seasonal in nature with the fourth quarter, the summer, being its busiest and most profitable.\nNOTE 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new guidance that created Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, in the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). Topic 606 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in FASB ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and requires the recognition of revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance also added Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs-Contracts with Customers, to the ASC to require the deferral of incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. The cumulative impact of adopting FASB ASC 606 was immaterial and did not require an adjustment to retained earnings.\nRevenue primarily consists of recreational camping space rentals, revenue from recreational vehicle storage space and RV service and repairs, food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services. Revenue is recognized when spaces are occupied or goods and services have been delivered or rendered, respectively.\nSales taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Finally, the Company collects Transient Occupancy Taxes (TOT) and Tourism Business Improvement District (TBID) assessments from guests which are remitted to the City of Pismo Beach and County of San Luis Obispo and are excluded from revenues. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $84,860 and $85,714 in TOT and TBID assessments due to the City of Pismo Beach and the County of San Luis Obispo included in accrued expenses on the combined balance sheet, respectively.\nPerformance Obligations\nFor performance obligations related to the Company accommodations and other ancillary goods and services, control transfers to the customer at a point in time. The Companys principal terms of sale occur simultaneously when control of the goods and services are transferred to the customer and payment is accepted. The Company does not have any significant financing components.\nThe Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an expected length of one year or less. Due to the nature of the business, the Companys revenue is not significantly impacted by refunds. Cash payments received in advance of guests staying at the resort are refunded to guests if the guest cancels within the specified time period, before any services are rendered. Refunds related to services are generally recognized as an adjustment to the transaction price at the time the resort stay occurs or services are rendered.\nDesegregation of Revenue\nRevenue from performance obligations satisfied at a point in time consists of sales related to the Company accommodations and other ancillary goods and services at the location in Pismo Beach,\nPISMO COAST VILLAGE, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nNOTE 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nCalifornia. The geographic nature of the revenue could affect the nature, timing, amount and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows. Revenue from site rentals, storage rental, spotting, and store and accessory sales accounts for approximately 64%, 14%, 4%, and 12% of the Company total revenue for the period ended September 30, 2022, respectively. Revenue from other ancillary goods and services accounts for the remaining 6% of revenue for the period ended September 30, 2022.\nCustomer Deposits\nThe Company does not recognize revenue when a customer prepays for resort accommodations. Rather, the Company records a deferred revenue liability equal to the amount received. Revenue is then recognized when the customer stays at the resort. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had Customer deposits related to prepaid village accommodations was $2,268,627 and $2,244,848 on the balance sheet as rental deposits, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nFor purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments including certificates of deposit with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $6,089 and $6,097 of cash equivalents.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nIt is the policy of management to review the outstanding accounts receivable at year-end, as well as historical bad debt write-offs, and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible accounts. Management did not believe an allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary as of September 30, 2022 or 2021.\nInventories\nInventories have been valued at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventories are comprised primarily of finished goods in the general store and in the RV repair shop.\nProperty and Equipment\nAll property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the cost of the assets, less allowance for salvage value, where appropriate. Depreciation rates are based upon the following estimated useful lives:\nBuilding and resort improvements\n5 to 40 years\nFurniture, fixtures, equipment, and leasehold improvements\n5 to 31.5 years\nTransportation equipment\n5 to 10 years\nPISMO COAST VILLAGE, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nNOTE 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nEarnings Per Share\nThe earnings per share are based on the 1,774 shares issued and outstanding. The financial statements report only basic earnings per share, as there are no potentially dilutive shares outstanding.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nAdvertising\nThe Company follows the policy of charging the costs of non-direct advertising as incurred. Advertising expense was $58,944 and $38,690 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Advertising expense was included in operating expenses on the statement of operations.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had cash deposits of $552,851 and $7,400,355 in excess of the $250,000 federally insured limit with Pacific Premier Bank, respectively. However, because Pacific Premier Bank is a member of the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS), large deposits are divided into smaller amounts and placed with other FDIC insured banks which are also members of the CDARS network. Then, those member banks issue CDs in amounts under $250,000, so that the entire deposit balance is eligible for FDIC insurance. Due to large fluctuations in the Operating checking account, there may be times when the balance is above the $250,000 FDIC threshold.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset-liability method of computing deferred taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Income Taxes topic. ASC 740 requires, among other things, that if income is expected for the entire year, but there is a net loss to date, a tax benefit is recognized based on the annual effective tax rate.\nFASB ASC 740 also requires, among other things, the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions based on a \"more likely than not\" (likelihood greater than 50%) approach. As of September 30, 2022, management has considered its tax positions and believes that the Company did not maintain any uncertain tax positions under this approach and, accordingly, all tax positions have been fully recorded in the provision for income taxes. It is the policy of the Company to consistently classify interest and penalties associated with income tax expense separately from the provision for income taxes, and accordingly no interest or penalties associated with income taxes have been included in this calculation, or separately in the Statement of Operations and Retained Earnings. The Company does not expect any material changes through September 30, 2023. Although the Company does not maintain any uncertain tax positions, tax returns remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for fiscal years ending on or after September 30, 2018 and by the California Franchise Tax Board for fiscal years ending on or after September 30, 2017.\nPISMO COAST VILLAGE, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nNOTE 3: Property and Equipment\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, property and equipment included the following:\nLand\n$\n10,394,747\n$\n10,394,747\nBuilding and resort improvements\n13,174,590\n13,185,090\nFurniture, fixtures, equipment and leasehold improvements\n870,440\n777,074\nTransportation equipment\n959,978\n794,974\nConstruction in progress\n87,589\n87,589\n25,487,344\n25,239,474\nLess accumulated depreciation\n(10,456,244)\n(9,976,930)\n$\n15,031,100\n$\n15,262,544\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $479,314 and $443,831 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021 the cost of assets under capital lease was $405,819 and $405,819, respectively, and related accumulated amortization was $331,071 and $267,393, respectively.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nThere has been no change of accountants, nor any disagreement with accountants, on any matter of accounting principle, practices, or financial statement disclosures required to be reported under this item. ITEM 9A(T). CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports, filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (who is our principal accounting officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of September 30, 2022 (the end of the period covered by this report). Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal accounting officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.\nINTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nOur management is also responsible for establishing internal control over financial reporting (\"ICFR\") as defined in Rules 13a-I5(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the 1934 Act. Our ICFR is intended to be designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our ICFR is expected to include policies and procedures that management believes are necessary that:\n1. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n2. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our directors; and\n3. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, and accordingly, even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect of financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective in future periods because of changes in conditions or due to deterioration in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures.\nAs of September 30, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) based on the criteria for effective ICFR established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments by smaller reporting companies and non-accelerated filers. Based on that assessment, management concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2022.\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this Annual Report.\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

OTHER OFFICERS AND SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYEES\nJAY JAMISON, Chief Executive Officer/General Manager and Assistant Corporate Secretary\nAge 69\nJay Jamison has been employed by the Company since June 1997 as General Manager and serves as Assistant Corporate Secretary.

Mr. Jamison was raised on his familys guest ranch, Rancho Oso, in Santa Barbara County, which included a recreational vehicle park, resident summer camp, equestrian facilities and numerous resort amenities. He worked on the ranch throughout his childhood and after college. The family business was sold in 1983, at which time Mr. Jamison was hired by Thousand Trails, Inc., a private membership resort, as a Resort Operations Manager. His last ten years at Thousand Trails were spent managing a 200-acre, 518-site, full-service resort near Hollister, California. He also managed Thousand Trails resorts in Acton and Idyllwild in Southern California. Prior to his employment with the Company, Mr. Jamison was a General Manager with Skycrest Enterprises in Redding and managed Sugarloaf Marina and Resort on Lake Shasta in Northern California between January 1995 and June 1997. Mr. Jamison was appointed to and served as a commissioner on the Pismo Beach Conference and Visitors Bureau from February 1998 to January 2010, serving as Chair from August 1999 until February 2009. At the 1999 National Association of RV Parks and Campgrounds Annual Convention, he was elected to serve on the Board of Directors representing the ten western states. During his two three-year terms on the Board, he served four years as Treasurer of the National Association, a position he held until he termed out December 2005. In June of 2002, Mr. Jamison was installed as a Director on the Board for the San Luis Obispo County Chapter of the American Red Cross, and served until June 2011, including from June 2006 until July 2008 as Board Chairman.

During his two four-year terms, he served on the Audit Committee, two years as committee Chairman, and one year on the Executive Committee.

In October 2021, Mr. Jamison informed the Executive Committee that he intended to retire at the end of the calendar year 2022. This provided the Company time to conduct a replacement search and allow the successor time to work with Mr. Jamison. On November 8, 2022, Mr. Jamison turned over his General Manager responsibilities to the new General Manager, Lesley Marr.\nc. FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS\nThere are no familial relationships between the Directors nor between the Directors and the Officers.\nd. INVOLVEMENT IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nTo the knowledge of the Company, none of the officers or directors have been personally involved in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the directors or officers have been convicted in any criminal proceedings (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses) or are the subject of a criminal proceeding which is presently pending, nor have such persons been the subject of any order, judgment, or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining them from acting as an investment advisor, underwriter, broker or dealer in securities, or as an affiliated person, director or insurance company, or from engaging in or continuing in any conduct or practice in connection with any such activity or in connection with the purchase or sale of any security, nor were any of such persons the subject of a federal or state authority barring or suspending, for more than 60 days, the right of such person to be engaged in any such activity, which order has not been reversed or suspended.\ne. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT\nOur Board of Directors has determined that it does not have a member of its Audit Committee that qualifies as an \"audit committee financial expert\" as defined in Item 401(e) of Regulation S-B, and is \"independent\" as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nWe believe that the members of our Audit Committee are collectively capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. Due to the fact that the Directors of Pismo Coast Village, Inc. do not receive compensation for the services they provide in that capacity, the Company has been unable to nominate and retain a director with the required expertise to stand for election to the Board of Directors. However, until the time that our Audit Committee has a qualified audit committee financial expert, we believe our engagement of Glenn Burdette (GB), Certified Public Accountants, satisfies this requirement. GB provides the Company's quarterly compilation of the balance sheets and the related statements of income and retained earnings, and cash flows in accordance with Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.\nf. CODE OF ETHICS\nOn November 8, 2003, the Company's Board of Directors adopted the introduction to our code of ethical conduct. After further review, consideration was given to adopting a more comprehensive and detailed Code. At the meeting of the Executive Committee held June 19, 2009, the committee approved a recommendation to present a revised Code of Ethics to the full Board for adoption. At the Board of Directors meeting held July 18, 2009, the Board unanimously approved the revised and complete Code of Ethics that applies to all the Company's employees and directors, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, and persons performing similar functions.\nThe complete text of the revised Code of Ethics is filed with this Form 10-K as Exhibit 14. In addition, the Company has posted the Code of Ethics on its website, www.pismocoastvillage.com.\nA copy of the Companys Code of Ethics will be provided to any person, without charge, upon written request. Requests for the Companys Code of Ethics should be addressed to:\nMs. Lesley Marr, General Manager\nPismo Coast Village, Inc.\n165 South Dolliver Street\nPismo Beach CA 93449\ng.
