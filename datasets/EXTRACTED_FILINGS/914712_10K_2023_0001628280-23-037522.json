    "content": "ITEM 1.- BUSINESS\nSteel Connect, Inc. (the Company) is a holding company which operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, ModusLink Corporation (\"ModusLink\" or \"Supply Chain\"). The Company previously operated under the names ModusLink Global Solutions, Inc., CMGI, Inc. and CMG Information Services, Inc. and was incorporated in Delaware in 1986.\nModusLink is an end-to-end global supply chain solutions and e-commerce provider serving clients in markets such as consumer electronics, communications, computing, medical devices, software and retail. ModusLink designs and executes critical elements in its clients' global supply chains to improve speed to market, product customization, flexibility, cost, quality and service. These benefits are delivered through a combination of industry expertise, innovative service solutions, and integrated operations, proven business processes, an expansive global footprint and world-class technology. ModusLink also produces and licenses an entitlement management solution powered by its enterprise-class Poetic software, which offers a complete solution for activation, provisioning, entitlement subscription and data collection from physical goods (connected products) and digital products. ModusLink has an integrated network of strategically located facilities in various countries, including numerous sites throughout North America, Europe and Asia.\nThe Company has approximately 1,000 employees worldwide.\nSteel Partners and Steel Connect Exchange Transaction\nOn April 30, 2023, Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (Steel Holdings) and the Company executed a series of agreements in which Steel Holdings and certain of its affiliates (the Steel Partners Group) agreed to transfer certain marketable securities held by the Steel Partners Group to the Company in exchange for 3.5 million shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, and, such transfer and related transactions, the Exchange Transaction). Following approval by the Company's stockholders pursuant to NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into an aggregate of 19.8 million shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the common stock or Common Stock), and will vote together with the Company's common stock and participate in any dividends paid on the Company's common stock, in each case on an as-converted basis. Upon conversion of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, the Steel Partners Group would hold approximately 84.0% of the outstanding equity interests of the Company. The Exchange Transaction closed on May 1, 2023, which is the date that the consideration was exchanged between Steel Holdings and the Company.\nOn May 1, 2023, we completed the Exchange Transaction with Steel Holdings and are now a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Steel Holdings. We have elected pushdown accounting in which we use Steel Holdings' basis of accounting, which reflects the fair market value of our assets and liabilities at the date of the Exchange Transaction. As a result, we have reflected the required pushdown accounting adjustments in our consolidated financial statements. Due to the application of\npushdown accounting, our consolidated financial statements and certain footnote disclosures are presented in two distinct periods to indicate the application of two different bases of accounting, which may not be comparable, between the periods presented. The pre-exchange period through April 30, 2023 is referred to as the \"Predecessor\" period. The post-exchange period, May 1, 2023 through July 31, 2023, includes the impact of pushdown accounting and is referred to as the \"Successor\" period. See Note 1 - \"Nature of Operations\" and Note 3 - \"Exchange Transaction\" for further information regarding the Exchange Transaction and our application of pushdown accounting.\nDisposition of Interest in Aerojet Shares\nAs a result of the Exchange Transaction, the Company recorded $202.7 million to investments, which represents the fair value of the Aerojet common stock transferred to Steel Connect. As of July 31, 2023, the Company had disposed of all its interest in Aerojet common stock. The majority of Aerojet common stock was purchased when L3 Harris closed its merger with Aerojet. As of July 31, 2023, the Company received $53.3 million in cash and had a receivable of $154.5 million for proceeds receivable, which was received in August 2023. The Company received total net proceeds of $207.8 million in exchange for all of its Aerojet shares.\nDisposition of IWCO Direct\nOn February 25, 2022 (\"the Disposal Date\"), the Company entered into a transaction agreement (the Transaction Agreement) with (a) IWCO Direct Holding Inc. (''IWCO Direct\" or \"Direct Marketing\") and its indirect subsidiaries, (b) Cerberus Business Finance, LLC, in its capacities as collateral agent and administrative agent under a financing agreement (in such capacities, the Agent), dated as of December 15, 2017, between IWCO Direct, IWCO Directs direct and indirect subsidiaries, the Agent and the lenders party thereto (the Lenders) (the Financing Agreement), (c) the Lenders, (d) the Lenders or their respective designees listed on the signature pages to the Transaction Agreement under the caption Participating Lender Purchasers (the Participating Lender Purchasers), (e) SPH Group Holdings LLC (the Sponsor) and (f) Instant Web Holdings, LLC (the Buyer), an entity owned by the Participating Lender Purchasers. On the Effective Date (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) and pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, the Company transferred all of its interests in IWCO Direct to the Buyer as part of a negotiated restructuring of the capital structure and certain financial obligations of IWCO Direct under the Financing Agreement as contemplated by the Transaction Agreement (the entire transaction being referred to as the IWCO Direct Disposal). The assets and liabilities and results of operations of the IWCO Direct business are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 1 - \"Nature of Operations\" and Note 4 - \"Discontinued Operations\" of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 in this Exhibit for further details regarding the disposition of IWCO Direct.\nModusLink's Services\nModusLink's revenue primarily comes from sales of adaptive supply chain services to its clients. Among ModusLink's core supply chain services are packaging, kitting & assembly, fulfillment, digital commerce and reverse logistics.\nPackaging, Kitting & Assembly-These services center on developing and executing a strategy that has product configuration and packaging done at the optimal time, and for the greatest strategic benefit. With sites located in the Americas, the Asia-Pacific region and Europe, ModusLink affords manufacturers just-in-time flexibility. Options with this service include the ability to delay product/order configuration until the order fulfillment stage, and using the facilities closest to a client's customers. In addition, ModusLink's light manufacturing services cover the final assembly of components and parts into finished goods, including build-to-order customization. ModusLink also offers additional value-added processes such as product testing, radio frequency identification tagging, product or service activation, language settings, personalization, and engraving and multi-channel packaging and packaging design.\nFulfillment-ModusLink's Fulfillment Services are highly integrated and supported by a best-of-breed technology infrastructure to enable clients to quickly increase efficiency and reduce costs. It has deep experience and is exceptionally skilled at handling the fulfillment requirements of multiple channels, be they manufacturing sites, distribution centers, retail operations or individual consumers dispersed across the globe. ModusLink is equally strong in adapting to the needs of retail/B2B or B2C product movement with respect to bringing product to market, including order management, pick, pack and ship, retail compliance and demand planning services, which are integral components of ModusLink's Fulfillment Services. In addition, ModusLink can help optimize component and finished goods inventory levels for better efficiency and cost savings. Clients also look to ModusLink for the physical programming of digital content-such as software, firmware, upgrades or promotional material-onto numerous types of flash media, including SD and MicroSD cards, USB drives, navigation systems, smartphones and tablets. This programming includes content protection and activation options, as well as full IP security. As direct-to-consumer volumes increase, ModusLink is able to provide a customer experience that can further enhance a brand's relationship with consumers.\nDigital Commerce-ModusLink's Digital Commerce Services are based on ModusLink's cloud-based e-commerce platform. These e-Business services remove the complexities and risk of a global web store, optimizing each stage of the online buying experience so that products can be quickly and easily purchased, serviced and delivered anywhere in the world. This end-to-end approach is fully integrated with global payment, customer relationship management (CRM) and fulfillment systems, helping clients to quickly and easily expand into a new region and country. In addition, if a client needs help in managing and optimizing its commerce solution once established, ModusLink can support that too. By leveraging ModusLink's e-commerce partnerships with Intershop and Shopify, clients can better meet revenue goals, drive growth and build their brands around the globe. Integration with either partner provides clients with a single, comprehensive view of their customers at every stage of their relationships. ModusLink can also manage the installation, integration and all technical operations for an online store, so a client can dedicate time and resources to its core business. By being able to adapt to their digital commerce and supply chain needs, ModusLink can help clients reach new markets, optimize order processing and customer service, reduce costs, and increase margins and flexibility without having to invest in their own infrastructure and personnel.\nReverse Logistics-ModusLink's Reverse Logistics Services simplify the returns process for retailers and manufacturers that want to improve service parts management and the value of returned assets. ModusLink manages the end-to-end process, including receipt, RMA, sorting, triage, credit processing and ultimate disposition of the returned product. Its approach to reverse logistics employs a modular global system that combines existing and new supply chain solutions, so clients can gain actionable insight into their reverse supply chains, which leads to reduced costs and increased customer service and satisfaction levels.\nModusLink's business solutions integrate with other supply chain service providers such as contract manufacturing companies and transportation providers.\nReportable Segment\nSubsequent to the Companys disposition of the Direct Marketing reportable segment with the IWCO Direct, the Company has one reportable segment: Supply Chain. The Company also has Corporate-level activity, which consists primarily of costs associated with certain corporate administrative functions such as legal, finance, share-based compensation and acquisition costs which are not allocated to the Company's reportable segments. The Corporate-level balance sheet information includes cash and cash equivalents, notes payable, and other assets and liabilities, which are not identifiable to the operations of the Company's reportable segment. Certain reportable segment information, including revenue, profit (loss) and asset information, is set forth in Note 24 - \"Segment Information\" of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 in this Report and in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nTechnology Infrastructure\nModusLink's information technology systems and infrastructure serve as the backbone of a client's fully integrated global supply chain services and manages the flow and use of physical assets and information. ModusLink offers a secure and redundant operating environment to ensure the integrity and privacy of its clients' data. ModusLink works with clients to integrate data, tools and applications to deliver an optimized solution that meets its clients' business needs and improves management of the global supply chain. ModusLink's ERP system is designed to provide the visibility and control needed for better decision making, rapid response to global market dynamics and effective asset utilization across services and geographies.\nCompetition\nThe market for the supply chain management service offerings provided by ModusLink is highly competitive. As a provider with service offerings covering a range of supply chain operations and activities across the globe, ModusLink competes with different companies depending on the type of service it is providing or the geographic area in which an activity is taking place. ModusLink faces competition from Electronics Manufacturing Services/Contract Manufacturers (EMS/CM), third party logistics (3PL) providers, Supply Chain Management (SCM) companies and regional specialty companies. For certain digital commerce services, ModusLink's competition includes global outsource providers, software as a service (SaaS) providers, technology providers and computer software providers offering content and document management solutions. As a provider of an outsourcing solution, ModusLink's competition also includes current and prospective clients, who evaluate ModusLink's capabilities in light of their own capabilities and cost structures.\nThe Company believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are quality and range of solutions and services, technological capabilities, costs, location of facilities, responsiveness and adaptability. With ModusLink's set of supply chain services, global footprint, strong client service acumen and its integrated global supply chain digital commerce services, the Company believes that it is well positioned to compete in each of the markets it serves, while expanding across various industry subsets. For more information, see ITEM 1A.- RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to a number of risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Report, before you decide whether to purchase our common stock. These factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the general or specific risks that may affect us. It should be recognized that other risks may be significant, presently or in the future, and the risks set forth below may affect us to a greater extent than indicated. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you many lose all or part of your investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS AND INDUSTRY\nChanges in our relationships with significant clients, including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe depend on a small number of clients for a substantial portion of our business. For the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company's 10 largest clients accounted for approximately 83% and 78% of consolidated net revenue, respectively. Two customers accounted for approximately 41% and 13% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, and two customers accounted for 31% and 12% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. No other clients accounted for greater than 10% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022.\nIn general, the Company does not have any agreements which obligate any client to buy a material amount of services from it or designate it as an exclusive service provider. Consequently, the Company's net revenue is subject to demand variability by our clients. The level and timing of orders placed by the Company's clients vary for a variety of reasons, including seasonal buying by end-users, the introduction of new technologies and general economic conditions. Changes in relationships with significant clients may require us to evaluate our other long-lived assets for impairment, which may require us to record an impairment charge. Decreases in client demand or volumes or loss of business from one or more of these clients could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results from operations. For more information, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates.\nIf the demand for supply chain management services declines, or if we are unable to or do not effectively integrate new or emerging marketing industry trends into our services and offerings, our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCustomer traffic and demand for our supply chain management services may be influenced by changing consumer demands and industry trends. Some of our competitors may expend more for their marketing programs than we do, or use different approaches than we do, which may provide them with a competitive advantage. Furthermore, we may not effectively develop or implement strategies with respect to rapidly evolving industry trends, including outsourcing supply chain management services, among other business practices. If our marketing efforts are not as successful or cost-effective as anticipated, our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may have difficulty achieving and sustaining operating profitability, and if that depletes our working capital balances, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nFor the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, we reported an operating income from continuing operations of $8.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant fixed operating expenses in the future within both cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses. Therefore, since our revenue is subject to fluctuations, there can be no assurance that we will sustain operating income in the future. We may also use significant amounts of cash in an effort to increase the efficiency and profitability of our business. If we are unable to achieve or sustain operating profitability, we risk depleting our working capital balances, and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nBecause most of our contracts do not contain minimum purchase requirements and we sell primarily on a purchase order basis, we are subject to uncertainties and variability in demand by clients, which could materially decrease revenue and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur contracts generally do not include minimum purchase requirements, and we sell primarily on a purchase order basis. Therefore, our sales are subject to unpredictable variability by our clients and have fluctuated historically. These fluctuations may continue, sometimes materially, from year to year and even from quarter to quarter. The level and timing of orders placed by these clients vary for a variety of reasons, including seasonal buying by end-users of Supply Chain customers, as well as individual client strategies, the introduction of new technologies, the desire of our clients to reduce their exposure to any single supplier and general economic conditions impacting our Supply Chain segment. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demands of our clients, we may lose clients because we have an inadequate supply of their products or insufficient capacity at our sites, or alternatively, we may have excess inventory or excess capacity, either of which may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results.\nEpidemics, pandemics, outbreaks of disease and other adverse public health developments, including COVID-19, previously had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEpidemics, pandemics, outbreaks of novel diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries and states where we operate may arise at any time. Such developments, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and in the future may have, an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. These effects include a potentially negative impact on our business activity and limited availability and productivity among our workforce and suppliers. In particular, reduced customer demand for our products, disruption in or closures of our manufacturing operations or those of our customers and suppliers, delays and disruption in the supply chain, limited productivity and efficiency of our personnel, availability of qualified personnel and increased cybersecurity risks associated with remote working environments, among other consequences, could increase our costs for raw materials and commodity costs, limit our ability to meet customer demand or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Precautionary measures that we may take in the future intended to limit the impact of any epidemic, pandemic, disease outbreak or other public health development may result in additional costs. In addition, such epidemics, pandemics, disease outbreaks or other public health developments may adversely affect economies and financial markets throughout the world, such as the effect that COVID-19 has had on world economies and financial markets, which may affect our ability to obtain additional financing for our businesses and demand for our products and services. The extent to which public health developments will impact our business and our financial results in the future will depend on various factors, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Such factors may include disease severity and spread, outbreak duration, extent of any reoccurrence or any evolutions or mutations of the virus, and availability, administration and effectiveness of vaccines and development of therapeutic treatments that can restore consumer and business economic confidence.\nOur business is subject to intense competition.\nThe markets for our services are highly competitive and often lack significant barriers to entry, enabling new businesses to enter these markets relatively easily. Numerous well-established companies and smaller entrepreneurial companies are focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that will compete with our offerings. The market for supply chain management products and services, is very competitive, and the intensity of the competition is expected to continue to increase. For more information, see Part I, Item 1. Business-Competition. Any failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position would limit our ability to maintain and increase market share, which could result in serious harm to our business. Increased competition may also result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors will continue to have greater financial, technical, operational and marketing resources. We may not be able to compete successfully against these competitors. Competitive pressures may also force prices for our products and services down, and these price reductions may reduce our revenue. The competition we face may also increase as a result of consolidation within the supply chain management and logistics industry. For example, if as a result of consolidation, our competitors are able to obtain more favorable terms from their suppliers, offer more comprehensive services to their customers, or otherwise take actions that increase their competitive strengths, our competitive position and therefore our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nOur operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, causing volatility in the price of our common stock.\nOur annual and quarterly operating results have fluctuated widely during the last several years and may continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors, including:\nhow well we execute on our overall strategy and operating plans;\nimplementation of our strategic initiatives and achievement of expected results of these initiatives;\ndemand for our services;\nconsumer confidence and demand;\nspecific economic conditions in the industries in which we compete;\ncompetitive disruptions or innovations affecting the services or products we provide;\ngeneral economic and financial market conditions, such as the impacts of inflation, slower growth or a recession;\ntiming of new product introductions or software releases by our clients or their competitors;\npayment of costs associated with our acquisitions, sales of assets and investments;\nmarket acceptance of new products and services;\nseasonality;\ntemporary shortages in supply from vendors;\ncharges for impairment of long-lived assets, including restructuring in future periods;\npolitical instability, including changes in tariff laws or natural disasters in the countries in which we operate;\nactual events, circumstances, outcomes and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions and estimates reflected in our accompanying consolidated financial statements;\nchanges in accounting rules;\nchanges in tax rules and regulations;\nchanges in labor laws;\navailability of labor resources and the variability of available rates for labor resources;\nunionization of our labor and contract labor; and\nimplementation of automation.\nWe believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations will not necessarily be meaningful or indicative of our future performance. In some fiscal quarters, our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline, severely impairing or eliminating the value of your investment. In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Technical factors in the public trading market for our common stock may produce price movements that may or may not comport with macro, industry or company-specific fundamentals, including, without limitation, the sentiment of retail investors (including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites), the amount and status of short interest in our securities, access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our common stock and any related hedging or other technical trading factors. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and may cause a significant increase in the premium paid for our directors and officers insurance.\nThe funds held for clients may be subject to credit risk, impairment, misappropriation or theft, and any such incident could result in harm to our clients and damage to our brand.\nIn the normal course of our business, we, at times, collect, process and/or retain client funds. The client funds are maintained at financial institutions both internationally and domestically, and the balances associated with these funds are at times without or in excess of federally insurable limits. Because such funds may not be fully protected, they could be vulnerable to external or internal unauthorized access or use, which may cause such funds to be impaired, misappropriated or stolen. Any impairment, misappropriation or theft of client funds could damage our reputation, expose us to mitigation costs and the risks of private litigation and government enforcement, disrupt our business and otherwise have a materially adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. In addition, our failure to respond quickly and appropriately to any impairment, misappropriation or theft of client funds could exacerbate the consequences to the client and to our business, as well as increase the time or cost necessary to mitigate or resolve the issue.\nA decline in our key business sectors or a reduction in consumer demand generally could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nA large portion of our revenue comes from clients in the technology and consumer products sectors, which is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes. A reduction or interruption in supply, including disruptions to our global supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or a significant natural disaster (including as a result of climate change) or otherwise, a failure to appropriately cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs, or a decrease in demand for our services could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships. There has been and may continue to be market shortages of semiconductor and other electrical component supplies, which has affected, and could further affect, our clients in the computing and consumer electrical markets and, consequently, their demand for our offerings. During periods of component shortages for our clients, we may also encounter reduced client demand, and accordingly, our revenue and profitability could suffer until other component sources can be developed.\nWe must maintain adequate levels of inventory in order to meet client needs, which presents risks to our financial position and operating results.\nWe must purchase and maintain adequate levels of inventory in order to meet client needs on a timely basis. The markets, including the technology sector served by many of our clients, are subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced product specification requirements and evolving industry standards. These changes may cause inventory on hand to decline substantially in value or to rapidly become obsolete. The majority of our clients offer protection from the loss in value of inventory. However, our clients may become unable or unwilling to fulfill their protection obligations, and the inability of our clients to do so could lower our gross margins and cause us to record inventory write-downs. If we are unable to manage the inventory on hand with our clients with a high degree of precision, we may have insufficient product supplies to meet demand or we may have excess inventory, resulting in inventory write-downs, which may harm our business, financial position and operating results.\nOur ability to obtain particular products or components in the quantities required to fulfill client orders on a timely basis is critical to our success. We have no guaranteed price or delivery agreements with our suppliers. We may occasionally experience a supply shortage of some products as a result of strong demand or problems experienced by our suppliers. If shortages or delays persist, the price of those products may increase, or the products may not be available at all. Accordingly, an inability to secure and maintain an adequate supply of products, packaging materials or components to fulfill our client orders on a timely basis, or a failure to meet clients expectations, could result in lost revenue, lower client satisfaction, negative perceptions in the marketplace, and potential claims for damages, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may have problems raising or accessing capital we need, or managing such capital once raised, in the future.\nIn recent years, we have financed our operations and met our capital requirements primarily through funds generated from operations, the sale of our securities, borrowings from lending institutions and sale of Company-owned facilities that were not being fully utilized. These funding sources may not be sufficient in the future and we may need to obtain additional funding from outside sources. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain such funding. Furthermore, even if we obtain outside funding sources, we may be required to issue to those outside sources securities with greater rights than those currently possessed by holders of our common stock. We may also be required to take other actions, which may lessen the value of our common stock or dilute our common stockholders, including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to us or issuing additional shares of common stock. If we experience difficulties raising needed capital in the future, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, market and other conditions largely beyond our control may affect our ability to engage in future sales of our securities, the timing of any such sales and the amount of proceeds we receive. Even if we are able to sell our securities in the future, we may not be able to sell at favorable prices or on favorable terms. As long as our public float is less than $75 million, we will be limited in selling our securities on a short-form registration statement on Form S-3 to offerings that do not exceed one-third of our public float in a rolling 12-month period. Therefore, the process of raising capital to support our growth may be more expensive and time consuming, including the use of a registration statement on Form S-1, and the terms of any offering transaction may not be as favorable as they would have been if we were eligible to use Form S-3 without these restrictions. In addition to entailing increased capital costs, any such transactions could result in substantial dilution of our stockholders' interests, transfer control to a new investor and/or diminish the value of an investment in our common stock.\nWe may also need to pursue strategic transactions, such as joint ventures, private placements or the sale of our business or all or substantially all of our assets. These private financings and strategic transactions could in the future require significant management attention, disrupt our business, adversely affect our financial results, be unsuccessful or fail to achieve the desired results. We are in discussions from time to time with such possible sources of additional funding. Additionally, following the\nissuance of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (Series E Preferred Stock), in the Exchange Transaction, it may be more challenging for us to raise equity financing.\nIf financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by the conditions of the U.S. and international capital markets, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to borrow funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate purposes.\nFinally, once we have raised capital, we face the risk of not using such capital effectively to increase the value of your investment. For example, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to successfully deploy the cash received as a result of the Exchange Transaction in furtherance of our overall strategy.\nWe may encounter problems in our efforts to increase operational efficiencies.\nBecause the markets in which we operate are highly competitive, we continue to seek to identify ways to increase efficiencies and productivity and effect cost savings. Our business is continually employing programs to achieve efficiencies, which include investment in capital equipment and automation. We cannot assure you that these projects and capital investments will result in the realization of the expected benefits that we anticipate in a timely manner or at all. We may encounter problems with these projects that will divert the attention of management and/or result in additional costs and unforeseen project delays. If we, or these projects, do not achieve expected results, our business, financial position and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. In addition to already undertaken projects in our business designed to increase our operational efficiencies, including the standardization to a global solutions platform through an integrated ERP system and the implementation of a model utilizing centralized hub locations to service multiple spoke locations across the Americas, Asia and Europe regions, our executive team is continuing its review across the organization designed to improve our operations.\nLoss of essential employees or an inability to recruit and retain personnel could have a significant negative impact on our business.\nOur success is largely dependent on the skills, experience, and efforts of the management and other employees of our Supply Chain business (currently our only business). The loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management or of numerous employees with essential skills could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to retain or attract talented, committed individuals to fill vacant positions when needs arise, it may adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. We do not currently maintain key persons insurance on our senior management. Labor market conditions may have an adverse impact on profitability and ability to deliver product on time. Any material increases in employee turnover rates could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to identify, manage, complete and integrate acquisitions and achieve anticipated synergies and benefits.\nWhile we have not made any acquisitions recently, part of our business strategy historically has been to acquire businesses that we believe can complement our current business activities, both financially and strategically. Acquisitions involve many complexities and inherent risk, including, but not limited to: failure to achieve all or any projected synergies or other intended benefits of the acquisition; failure to integrate the purchased operations, technologies, products or services; substantial unanticipated integration costs; loss of key employees, including those of the acquired business; additional debt and/or assumption of unknown liabilities; loss of customers; and the impact on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a result, there is no guarantee that our acquisitions will increase the profitability and cash flow of the Company, and our efforts could cause unforeseen complexities and additional cash outflows, including financial losses. Additionally, following the issuance of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, which further consolidated control in Steel Partners Group, it may be more challenging for us to raise equity financing or to use our equity as acquisition consideration, which may in turn hamper our ability to complete acquisitions. For more\ninformation, see RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS AND INDUSTRY-We may have problems\nraising or accessing capital we need in the future.\nWe conduct business outside of the U.S., which exposes the Company to additional risks not typically associated with companies that operate solely within the U.S.\nThe majority of the operations of our business is in foreign countries, including Mainland China, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Ireland and Singapore. These operations have additional risks, including currency exchange, foreign exchange controls, difficulties and limitations on the repatriation of cash, less developed or efficient financial markets than in the U.S., absence of uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, differences in the legal and regulatory environment, different publicly available information in respect of companies in non-U.S. markets, pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations where we have customers and a balance of cash and marketable securities, different or lesser protection of our intellectual property, including increased risk of theft of our proprietary technology and other intellectual property and possible imposition of non-U.S. taxes.\nWe also face risks related to compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations applicable to our international operations. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions foreign exchange controls, U.S. laws such as export control laws, economic sanctions laws, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar laws in other countries, which also prohibit certain activities including corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers. Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently breached. Also, we may be held liable for\nactions taken by our local partners. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal penalties against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries.\nCertain geopolitical factors may also affect our operations internationally, including:\nliquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, including nations with a controlled currency environment, which could result in decreased values of these balances or potential difficulties protecting our foreign assets or satisfying local obligations;\nuncertainty regarding the imposition of and changes in the United States and other governments trade regulations, trade wars, tariffs, other restrictions or other geopolitical events, including the evolving relations between the United States and China, the United States and Russia and Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine;\nchanges in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate; and\nregional economic and political conditions.\nAny of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. The above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries, where we have little or no operating experience, where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations, including hiring and managing required personnel, and difficult to promote our brand, and where we may not benefit from any first-to-market advantage or otherwise succeed.\nOur business in Mainland China faces specific risks.\nA significant portion of our revenue historically has come from Mainland China, and our business in turn faces certain specific risks relating to operations in Mainland China and its complex and unpredictable political, economic and legal environment. Foreign businesses must navigate a complex set of licensing and tax requirements and restrictions affecting their conduct of business in Mainland China, and the Chinese government may in the future adopt additional measures favoring local businesses that make it more difficult for foreign businesses to operate on an equal footing. From time to time, the Chinese government also implements various corrective measures, including, but not limited to, controls on credit or prices and currency restrictions, to regulate growth and inflation. These and any other measures could adversely affect our ability to operate in Mainland China and/or inhibit economic activity in China and thereby harm the market for our products and services.\nIn addition, as Chinas legal system continues to evolve, the interpretation and enforcement of many laws, regulations and rules involve significant uncertainties, including with respect to intellectual property protection. Any third parties we rely on in Mainland China may disclose our or our clients confidential information or intellectual property to competitors or third parties, which could result in the illegal distribution and sale of counterfeit versions of our products. The legal protections and remedies available in the event of any claims or disputes may be limited and any litigation in Mainland China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.\nMoreover, our ability to operate in Mainland China may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. and Chinese laws and regulations, such as those related to, among other things, international trade, taxation, intellectual property, currency controls, network security, employee benefits and other matters. Additionally, the U.S. administration has advocated greater restrictions on trade generally and significant increases on tariffs on certain goods imported into the United States, particularly from Mainland China and has taken steps toward restricting trade in certain goods. China and other countries have retaliated in response to new trade policies, treaties and tariffs implemented by the United States. China has imposed significant tariffs on U.S. imports since 2018. Such trade escalations have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on manufacturing and trade levels and specifically, may cause an increase in the cost of goods exported from Asia Pacific and the risks associated with exporting goods from the region. If any of these events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe physical or intellectual property of our clients may be damaged, misappropriated, stolen or lost while in our\npossession, subjecting us to potential litigation and other adverse consequences.\nIn the course of providing supply chain management services to our clients, we often have possession of or access to their physical and intellectual property, including consigned inventory, databases, software masters, certificates of authenticity and similar valuable physical or intellectual property. If this physical or intellectual property is damaged, misappropriated stolen or lost, we could suffer the following harmful consequences: claims under client agreements or applicable law, or other liability for damages; delayed or lost revenue due to adverse client reaction; negative publicity; and litigation that could be costly and time consuming and which may not be reimbursable by third party insurance coverages.\nA significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our technology systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on information and operational technology systems in the conduct of our business to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. In some cases, we may rely upon third-party providers of hosting, support and other services to meet our information technology requirements. We also collect and store sensitive data, including confidential business information and personal data. Upgrading our information technology systems is costly and subject to delay, and there is no assurance new systems will provide the benefits expected. We may also experience operational problems attributable to the installation, implementation, integration, performance, features or functionality of third-party software, systems and services.\nIn addition, our information and operational technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, worms or other malicious software programs, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters, defects in design, employee malfeasance, and human or technological errors. Cybersecurity incidents in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, use of malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or control of automated production systems, and other security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Various procedures and controls to monitor, deter and mitigate these threats have been implemented. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of technology security incidents and disruptions, our business could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, theft, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition, reputation or results of operations. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience actual or attempted cyber-attacks of our information technology systems or networks, yet none of these actual or attempted cyber-attacks has had a material effect on us, including on our operations or financial condition. Further, any failure by our hosting and support partners or other third-party service providers in the performance of their services could materially harm our business. While we try to maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage that we believe is adequate for our business, such coverage may not cover all potential costs and expenses associated with any security incidents that may occur or may not be available at a reasonable cost in the marketplace in the future.\nA breach of our information technology systems could also result in the misappropriation of intellectual property, business plans or trade secrets. Any failure of our systems or those of our third-party service providers could result in unauthorized access or acquisition of proprietary information. Any actual or perceived security breach could cause significant damage to our reputation, expose us to liability or regulatory enforcement action and adversely impact our relationships with our customers or vendors. Additionally, while our security systems are designed to maintain the physical security of our facilities and information systems, accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access by third parties to our facilities or our information systems could lead to misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information.\nIf any person, including any of our employees or those with whom we share such information, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to our client, customer or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. State and federal laws could also require us to provide notice to affected individuals if their personal data became the subject of a security breach, which would impose costs and could lead to additional liability and negative publicity.\nWe take cybersecurity and data privacy seriously and devote significant resources and tools to protect our systems, products and data and to prevent unwanted intrusions and disclosures, in compliance with applicable U.S. federal and state laws and non-U.S. laws and regulations addressing cybersecurity and data privacy. In particular, we have put in place policies and procedures to address the European General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect in January 2020. However, these security and compliance efforts are costly to implement and may not be successful. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent, detect and adequately address or mitigate all cyber-attacks or security breaches. Any such breach could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our reputation and could cause irreparable damage to us or our systems, regardless of whether we or our third-party providers are able to adequately recover critical systems following a systems failure.\nLitigation pending against us could materially impact our business and results of operations.\nWe are currently a party to various legal and other proceedings. See \"Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report. Trends in litigation may include class actions involving consumers, stockholders or employees, and claims relating to commercial, labor, employment, antitrust, securities or environmental matters. Litigation trends and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could result in material damages and/or other\nexpenses, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We can provide no assurances as to the outcome of any litigation.\nRISKS RELATED TO TAXATION\nWe may be unable to realize the benefits of our remaining net operating loss carry-forwards and other tax benefits (collectively, \"NOLs\" or \"Tax Benefits\").\nOur past operations generated significant NOLs. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which among, other things, amends the treatment of NOLs. Under federal tax laws, for NOLs arising in tax years beginning before January 1, 2018, we generally can use any such NOLs and certain related tax credits to reduce ordinary income tax paid in our prior two tax years or on our future taxable income for up to 20 years, at which point they expire for such purposes. Until they expire, we can carry forward NOLs and certain related tax credits that we do not use in any particular year to offset taxable income in future years. For NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021, we are allowed to carryback such NOLs to each of the five taxable years preceding the taxable year of such losses and generally can use any such NOLs and certain related tax credits to reduce ordinary income tax paid on our future taxable income indefinitely. For NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020, we generally can use such NOLs and certain related tax credits to reduce ordinary income tax paid on our future taxable income indefinitely; however, any such NOLs cannot be used to reduce ordinary income tax paid in prior tax years. In addition, the deduction for NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020 is limited to 80% of our taxable income for any tax year (computed without regard to the NOL deduction and subject to certain other adjustments). NOLs arising in tax years beginning before January 1, 2018, are referred to herein as \"Current NOLs.\" The Company had net NOL carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately $369.9 million and $138.8 million, respectively, at July 31, 2023. Of the total U.S. federal NOLs, $96.6 million do not expire and the remaining carry-forwards of $273.3 million will expire at various dates beginning in 2024 through 2038. We cannot estimate the exact amount of NOLs that we will be able use to reduce future income tax liability because we cannot predict the amount and timing of our future taxable income.\nOur ability to utilize our NOLs to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an \"ownership change,\" as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\" or \"Internal Revenue Code\"). Under Section 382, an \"ownership change\" occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders that each owns (or is deemed to own) at least 5% of our common stock increases their aggregate ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 would impose an annual limit on the amount of our NOLs that we can use to offset taxable income equal to the product of the total value of our outstanding equity immediately prior to the ownership change (reduced by certain items specified in Section 382) and the federal long-term tax-exempt rate in effect for the month of the ownership change. Several complex rules apply to calculating this annual limit.\nIf an ownership change is deemed to occur, the limitations imposed by Section 382 could significantly limit our ability to use our NOLs to reduce future income tax liability and result in a material amount of our Current NOLs expiring unused and, therefore, significantly impair the value of our Current NOLs. While the complexity of Section 382s provisions and the limited knowledge any public company has about the ownership of its publicly traded securities make it difficult to determine whether an ownership change has occurred, we currently believe that an ownership change has not occurred.\nOur ability to use our Current NOLs in future years will depend upon the amount of our federal and state taxable income. If we do not have sufficient federal and state taxable income in future years to use the Current NOLs before they expire, we will lose the benefit of the Current NOLs permanently. In addition to the generation of future federal and state taxable income, our ability to use our Current NOLs will depend significantly on our success in identifying suitable acquisition or investment candidates, and once identified, successfully consummating an acquisition of, or investment in these candidates. We have adopted an amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Protective Amendment) and a tax benefit preservation plan (Tax Plan), each designed to preserve our ability to utilize our NOLs, by preventing an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 that would impair our ability to utilize our NOLs. For more information, see Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Tax Benefits Preservation Plan.\nAlthough the Protective Amendment and the Tax Plan are intended to diminish the likelihood of an ownership change, we cannot assure you that it will be effective. The amount by which an ownership interest may change in the future could, for example, be affected by purchases and sales of common stock by stockholders holding five percent or more of our outstanding common stock, over which we have no control, and new issuances of shares of common stock by us, should we choose to do so.\nThe amount of NOLs that we have claimed has not been audited or otherwise validated by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"). The IRS could challenge our calculation of the amount of our NOLs or our determinations as to when a prior\nchange in ownership occurred, and other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to carry forward our NOLs to offset taxable income in future years. If the IRS was successful with respect to any such challenge, the potential tax benefit of the NOLs to us could be substantially reduced. In addition, determining whether an ownership change has occurred is subject to uncertainty, both because of the complexity and ambiguity of the Section 382 provisions and because of limitations on the knowledge that any publicly traded company can have about the ownership of, and transactions in, its securities on a timely basis. Therefore, we cannot assure you that the IRS or other taxing authority will not claim that we experienced an ownership change and attempt to reduce the benefit of the NOLs even if the Protective Amendment and Tax Plan are in place. Any of the above risks to our ability to use our NOLs could materially adversely affect the value of your investment.\nThere may be adverse effects on the value of your investment from our use of the Protective Amendment and Tax Plan.\nThe Protective Amendment and Tax Plan are intended to deter persons or groups of persons from acquiring beneficial ownership of our Common Stock in excess of the specified limitations, as a way of preventing an ownership change and protecting our ability to use our NOLs. For more information, see Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Tax Benefits Preservation Plan. Nonetheless, the Protective Amendment and Tax Plan may have an anti-takeover effect because they may deter a person or group of persons from acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of our outstanding common stock or, in the case of a person or group of persons that already own 4.99% or more of our outstanding common stock, from acquiring any additional common stock. The Protective Amendment and Tax Plan could discourage or prevent a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or accumulations of substantial blocks of shares of common stock.\nAdditionally, a stockholders ability to dispose of our common stock may be limited if the Protective Amendment or Tax Plan reduces the number of persons willing to acquire our common stock or the amount they are willing to acquire. Thus, the Protective Amendment and Tax Plan could severely reduce liquidity of our common stock, negatively impacting the value of your investment. A stockholder may also become a greater than 4.99% stockholder upon actions taken by persons related to, or affiliated with, that stockholder. Stockholders are advised to carefully monitor their ownership of our common stock and consult their own legal advisors and/or us to determine whether their ownership of common stock approaches the proscribed level.\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign tax audits, which could result in the imposition of liabilities that may or may not have been reserved, and changes in our provision for income taxes.\nWe are subject to audits by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions with respect to income taxes and for various other taxes, including but not limited to value added tax (\"VAT\"), excise tax, sales and use tax, gross receipts tax and property tax. These audits can cover periods for several years prior to the date the audit is undertaken and could result in the imposition of liabilities, interest and penalties if our tax positions are not accepted by the auditing tax authority.\nIn addition, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\"), an international association comprised of 38 countries, including the United States, has made changes and is contemplating additional changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes finalized and adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes.\nAn increase in our effective tax rate may adversely impact our results of operations.\nA number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates, including:\nthe jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\nthe adverse resolution of issues affecting our business and arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\nadjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;\nincreases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes;\nchanges in available tax credits;\nchanges in share-based compensation;\nchanges in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles;\nthe repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes; and\nincreases in tax rates in various jurisdictions.\nAny significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nSteel Partners Holdings, L.P. and its affiliates own the vast majority of the voting power of our capital stock and have control over our corporate decisions.\nAs of July 31, 2023, Steel Holdings, directly and indirectly, owned approximately 84.9% of our outstanding common stock (on an as-converted basis), and, when combined with its affiliated entities and individuals who are members of a Section 13(d) group with Steel Holdings and its affiliated entities, 85.9%, of our outstanding common stock (on an as-converted basis). This includes, in addition to shares of common stock held outright, all shares of common stock underlying the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, and Series E Preferred Stock (which vote on an as-converted basis together with the holders of common stock), par value $0.01 per share, and 584,055 shares of common stock underlying the Companys 7.50% Convertible Senior Note due 2024 (which are not entitled to vote, but are deemed to be beneficially owned by SPH Group Holdings LLC, which is controlled by Steel Holdings, based on their convertibility at the holders option). In addition, four of our board members include the Executive Chairman of the general partner of Steel Holdings, the President of Steel Holdings, an affiliate of Steel Holdings and the Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Legal Officer of Steel Holdings.\nAs a result of this board representation and ownership of our capital stock, Steel Holdings and its affiliates control our management and affairs and/or control most matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, the passage of a tax benefits preservation plan, a business combination and most and possibly all amendments to our organizational documents. In addition, because a business combination, such as a merger or consolidation, requires the affirmative vote of 75% of our outstanding voting stock, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Additionally, minority stockholders could not call a special meeting, as this requires at least 20% of the total voting power of the Company. Steel Holdings and its affiliates may also have interests that are different from other shareholders and may vote in a way that may be adverse to our other stockholders' interests. Conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, could arise between our interests and the interests of Steel Holdings and its affiliates See Note 25 - \"Related Party Transactions\" of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nMembers of our Board of Directors also have significant interests in Steel Holdings and its affiliates, which may create conflicts of interest.\nSome members of our Board of Directors also hold positions with Steel Holdings and its affiliates. Specifically, Warren G. Lichtenstein, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of the Board, is affiliated with Steel Holdings and is the Executive Chairman of Steel Partners Holdings GP Inc. (\"Steel Holdings GP\"). Glen Kassan, our Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Chief Administrative Officer, is affiliated with Steel Holdings and is an employee of Steel Services. Jack L. Howard, a director, is the President of Steel Holdings and a director of Steel Holdings GP. Joseph Martin, a director, is Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Legal Officer of Steel Holdings. See our definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed August 1, 2023 for full biographical information for Messrs. Lichtenstein, Kassan, Howard and Martin.\nAs a result, these individuals may face potential conflicts of interest with each other and with our stockholders. They may be presented with situations in their capacity as either an officer or as our directors that conflict with their fiduciary obligations to Steel Holdings and its affiliates, which in turn may have interests that conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. While our contractual arrangements place restrictions on the parties' conduct in certain situations and related party transactions are subject to independent review and approval in accordance with our related party transaction approval procedures and applicable law, the potential for a conflict of interest exists and such persons may have conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, with respect to matters involving or affecting Steel Holdings and affiliates.\nRISKS RELATED TO REVERSE/FORWARD STOCK SPLIT\nThe reverse/forward stock split (the Reverse/Forward Stock Split) may decrease the liquidity of our Common Stock.\nAlthough our Board believes that the decrease in the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding as a consequence of the Reverse/Forward Stock Split and the subsequent increase in the market price of our Common Stock could encourage interest in our Common Stock and possibly promote greater liquidity for our stockholders, such liquidity could also be adversely affected by the reduced number of shares outstanding after the Reverse/Forward Stock Split. The liquidity of our Common Stock may ultimately be harmed by the Reverse/Forward Stock Split given the reduced number of shares of Common Stock outstanding after the Reverse/Forward Stock Split, particularly if the stock price does not continue to increase.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS\nOur indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nOur only outstanding debt is under our 7.50% Senior Convertible Notes, but indebtedness we incur in the future could have important consequences for us and our stockholders. For more information, see \"Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt and Financing Arrangements\" of this Annual Report.\nDebt agreements we enter into in the future could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes. In addition, such indebtedness could:\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and competitive pressures in our industry;\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.\nSuch future debt agreements could also contain affirmative and negative covenants, including with regard to specified financial covenants, which limit and restrict our operations and may hamper our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Events beyond our control could affect our ability to meet these and other covenants under the debt agreements. Our failure to comply with those covenants and other obligations under the debt agreements may result in an event of default thereunder. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of future indebtedness. This could have serious consequences to our financial condition, operating results and business, and could cause us to become insolvent or enter into bankruptcy proceedings, and stockholders may lose all or a portion of their investment because of the priority of the claims of the creditors on the assets\nChanges in reference interest rates could adversely affect our results from operations and financial condition.\nAn increase in prevailing interest rates would have an effect on the interest rates charged on our variable rate debt, which rise and fall upon changes in reference interest rates. If prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates, the increased interest expense would adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness. ITEM 1B.- UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2.- PROPERTIES\nOur corporate headquarters are located in New York, New York. As of July 31, 2023, our Supply Chain business leased more than 20 sites in several countries from which we operate ModusLink, which consist of office and warehouse space and are located throughout the world, including, but not limited to, the United States, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Singapore, Japan, Australia and Mainland China.\nWe believe that our existing properties are suitable and adequate for our present purposes and provide sufficient capacity to meet our anticipated requirements, and that new facilities will be available in the event we need additional or new space. ITEM 3.- LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThe information required with respect to this item can be found in Note 13 - \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to our consolidated financial statements and is incorporated by reference into this Item 3. For an additional discussion of certain risks associated with legal proceedings, also see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Report. ITEM 4.- MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5.-MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information\nAs of July 31, 2023, we had 6,250,493 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"STCN.\"\nStockholders\nAs of July 31, 2023, there were approximately 20 holders of record of common stock of the Company. This number does not include beneficial owners for whom shares are held by nominees in street name.\nDividends\nPayment of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, any restrictions on payment of dividends under our credit facilities, current and anticipated cash needs and plans for expansion.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nNone.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe Company did not make any purchases of its common stock during the year ended July 31, 2023.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\nInformation regarding the Company's equity compensation plans and the securities authorized for issuance thereunder is set forth in Item 12 of Part III.\nPerformance Graph\nConsistent with the rules applicable to \"Smaller Reporting Companies\" we have omitted information required by this item. ITEM 6.- SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\nRESERVED. ITEM 7.- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act. For this purpose, any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"plans,\" \"expects\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Report. For more information, see Forward Looking Statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management's analysis, judgment, belief or expectation only as of the date hereof. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nOverview\nSteel Connect, Inc. (the \"Company\") is a holding company which operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, ModusLink Corporation (\"ModusLink\" or \"Supply Chain\"), which serves the supply chain management market.\nModusLink provides digital and physical supply chain solutions to many of the world's leading brands across a diverse range of industries, including consumer electronics, telecommunications, computing and storage, software and content, consumer packaged goods, medical devices, retail and luxury and connected devices. These solutions are delivered through a combination of industry expertise, innovative service solutions, and integrated operations, proven business processes, an\nexpansive global footprint and world-class technology. With a global footprint spanning North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region, the Company's solutions and services are designed to improve end-to-end supply chains in order to drive growth, lower costs, and improve profitability.\nSteel Partners and Steel Connect Exchange Transaction\nOn April 30, 2023, Steel Partners Holdings L.P., (Steel Holdings) and the Company executed a series of agreements in which Steel Holdings and certain of its affiliates (the Steel Partners Group) agreed to transfer certain marketable securities held by the Steel Partners Group to the Company in exchange for 3.5 million shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, and, such transfer and related transactions, the Exchange Transaction). The Series E Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into an aggregate of 19.8 million shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the common stock or Common Stock), and votes together with the Company's common stock and participate in any dividends paid on the Company's common stock, in each case on an as-converted basis. Upon conversion of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, the Steel Partners Group would hold approximately 84.0% of the outstanding equity interests of the Company. The Exchange Transaction closed on May 1, 2023, which is the date that the consideration was exchanged between Steel Holdings and the Company. Refer to Note 1 - \"Nature of Operations\" and Note 3 - \"Exchange Transaction\" to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nPredecessor/Successor Reporting\nOn May 1, 2023, the Exchange Transaction resulted in Steel Holdings obtaining control of the Company for financial statement purposes. Steel Holdings does not consolidate the Company for Federal income tax purposes because the ownership in the Company is dispersed between different federal tax consolidation groups within Steel Holdings. The Company elected pushdown accounting in which it uses Steel Holdings' basis of accounting, which reflects the fair market value of the Companys assets and liabilities at the date of the Exchange Transaction. As a result, the Company has reflected the required pushdown accounting adjustments in its consolidated financial statements. Due to the application of pushdown accounting, the Companys consolidated financial statements and certain footnote disclosures include a black line division between the two distinct periods to indicate the application of two different bases of accounting, which may not be comparable, between the periods presented. The pre-exchange period through April 30, 2023 is referred to as the \"Predecessor\" period. The post-exchange period, May 1, 2023 through July 31, 2023, includes the impact of pushdown accounting and is referred to as the \"Successor\" period. Refer to Note 1 - \"Nature of Operations\" and Note 3 - \"Exchange Transaction\" to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information.\nAs it relates to the results of operations, while the 2023 Successor period and the 2023 Predecessor period are distinct reporting periods, the effects of the change of control for financial statement purposes did not have a material impact on the comparability of our results of operations between the periods, unless otherwise noted related to the impact from pushdown accounting. References to the combined 2023 period from August 1, 2022 to July 31, 2023 combine the period from August 1, 2022 to April 30, 2023 (Predecessor) and the period from May 1, 2023 to July 31, 2023 (Successor) (the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period) to enhance the comparability of such information to the prior year.\nReverse/Forward Stock Split\nAt the special stockholders meeting held on June 6, 2023, the stockholders approved proposals to amend the Companys restated certificate of incorporation (the Charter), to effect a 1-for-3,500 reverse stock split of the common stock (the Reverse Stock Split), followed immediately by a 375-for-1 forward stock split of the common stock (the Forward Stock Split, and, together with the Reverse Stock Split, the Reverse/Forward Stock Split). On June 7, 2023, the Board approved the Reverse/Forward Stock Split, and as such, the Board directed the Company to file with the State of Delaware certificates of amendment to our Charter to effectuate the Reverse/Forward Stock Split. The Reverse/Forward Stock Split was effective on June 21, 2023 (the Effective Date). The Companys common stock began trading on a Reverse/Forward Stock Split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Capital Market when the market opened on June 22, 2023. The trading symbol for the Companys common stock remains STCN.\nNo fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse/Forward Stock Split. Shares held by stockholders who held fewer than 3,500 of the Companys common stock immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split were converted into the right to receive a payment in cash (without interest) equal to the fair value of such shares as of the time when those entitled to receive such payments were determined, which shall be an amount equal to such number of shares of Companys common stock held multiplied by the average of the closing sales prices of the Companys common stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split, and each share of Companys common stock held by a stockholder of record owning 3,500 shares or more immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split were converted into a new number of shares of Companys common stock based on a ratio of 375 shares of the Companys common stock for each share of the Companys common stock owned immediately following the Reverse\nStock Split, including any fractional shares owned following the Reverse Stock Split; however, with respect to any fractions of a share of Company Common Stock that may be held as a result of the Forward Stock Split, stockholders received a payment in cash (without interest) equal to the fair value of such fractions as of the time when those entitled to receive such fractions are determined, which was an amount equal to such fractions multiplied by the average of the closing sales prices of the Companys common stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the effective date of the Reverse/Forward Stock Split (with such average closing sales prices being adjusted to give effect to the Reverse/Forward Stock Split).\nThe number of shares of authorized Companys common stock did not change as a result of the Reverse/Forward Stock Split; however, the number of shares of outstanding Companys common stock decreased as a result of the Reverse/Forward Stock Split.\nAccordingly, all share and per-share amounts for the current period and prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse/Forward Stock Split.\nThe number of shares of Companys common stock issuable upon the exercise of Series C Preferred Stock and the Series E Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Reverse/Forward Stock Split were proportionately decreased and the conversion price of the Series C Preferred Stock and the Series E Preferred Stock were proportionately increased, effective as of June 21, 2023, the close of business on the date of such Reverse/Forward Stock Split. Our authorized preferred stock was not affected by the reverse stock split and continues to be 3,535,000 shares of preferred stock, with a par value of $0.01 per share.\nDisposition of Interest in Aerojet Shares\nAs a result of the Exchange Transaction, the Company recorded $202.7 million to investments, which represents the fair value of the Aerojet common stock transferred to Steel Connect. As of July 31, 2023, the Company had disposed of all its interest in Aerojet common stock. The majority of Aerojet common stock was purchased when L3 Harris closed its merger with Aerojet. As of July 31, 2023, the Company received $53.3 million in cash and had a receivable of $154.5 million for proceeds receivable, which was received in August 2023. The Company received total net proceeds of $207.8 million in exchange for all of its Aerojet shares.\nDisposition of IWCO Direct Holdings, Inc. (\"IWCO Direct\" or \"Direct Marketing\")\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2020, with the shutdown of the U.S. economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic, IWCO Directs business was significantly and adversely affected by a material reduction in customer mailing activities. Against this backdrop, the Company held, on behalf of IWCO Direct, extensive discussions with Cerberus about amending and extending IWCO Directs credit facility with Cerberus under which there was approximately $361 million outstanding as of January 31, 2022 that was to mature in December 2022. In addition, the Companys Board of Directors considered a range of strategic options to address the impending maturity. In mid-January 2022, it became apparent that it would not be possible to extend or refinance the credit facility prior to its maturity. In addition, short-term funding under the revolving credit facility became unavailable. IWCO Direct was in the process of implementing the previously disclosed competitive improvement plan (CIP) intended to address the changing requirements of its customers and markets. Despite initial favorable outcomes and improving prospects from the CIP, the Company was unable to amend IWCO Direct's credit facility or identify alternatives to refinance IWCO Directs indebtedness given the magnitude of that indebtedness relative to the performance of IWCO Directs business.\nIn light of these developments, the Board of Directors determined that it was in the best interests of the Companys stockholders to pursue an orderly and consensual disposition of IWCO Direct to the Cerberus-led investor group. Although the Board of Directors considered other alternatives for IWCO Direct, the Board of Directors concluded that such alternatives would not be viable and on February 25, 2022, the Company completed the disposition of IWCO Direct to the Cerberus-led investor group (the entire transaction being referred to as the IWCO Direct Disposal). The Company did not receive any cash consideration from the Cerberus-led investor group in exchange for the disposition of IWCO Direct.\nThe Company deconsolidated IWCO Direct as of February 25, 2022 as it no longer held a controlling financial interest as of that date. The results of IWCO Direct are presented as a discontinued operation in all periods reported. Refer to Note 1 - \"Nature of Operations\" and Note 4 - \"Discontinued Operations\" to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information on the IWCO Direct Disposal.\nCustomers\nHistorically, a limited number of key clients have accounted for a significant percentage of the Company's revenue. For the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period and the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, the Company's 10 largest clients accounted for approximately 83% and 78% of consolidated net revenue from continuing operations, respectively. Two\ncustomers accounted for approximately 41% and 13% of the Company's consolidated net revenue from continuing operations for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period, and they accounted for 31% and 12% of the Company's consolidated net revenue from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. No other customers accounted for greater than 10% of consolidated net revenue in these periods.\nIn general, the Company does not have any agreements that obligate any client to buy a minimum amount of services from it or designate it as an exclusive service provider. Consequently, the Company's net revenue is subject to demand variability by our clients. The level and timing of orders placed by the Company's clients vary for a variety of reasons, including seasonal buying by end-users, the introduction of new technologies and general economic conditions. By diversifying into new markets and improving the operational support structure for its clients, the Company expects to offset the adverse financial impact such factors may bring about.\nResults of Operations\nUnless otherwise noted, this discussion of operating results relates to our continuing operations.\nThe following summarizes the consolidated results of operations for the Predecessor and Successor periods, which relate to the periods preceding and period succeeding the Exchange Transaction with Steel Holdings, respectively. The results of operations for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period and the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 are comparable unless otherwise noted that as a result of pushdown accounting the periods are not comparable.\nComparison of the Period from August 1, 2022 to April 30, 2023 (Predecessor) and the Period from May 1, 2023 to July 31, 2023 (Successor) to Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2022 (Predecessor)\nSuccessor Period Predecessor Period Predecessor Period\nMay 1 to July 31, 2023 August 1, 2022 to April 30, 2023 Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2022 $ Change1, 2\n% Change1, 2\n(In thousands)\nNet revenue $ 40,804 $ 148,283 $ 189,087 $ 203,272 $ (14,185) (7.0) %\nCost of revenue (29,749) (108,031) (137,780) (161,736) 23,956 14.8 %\nGross profit 11,055 40,252 51,307 41,536 9,771 23.5 %\nGross profit percentage 27.1 % 27.1 % 27.1 % 20.4 % n/a 670 bpts\nSelling, general and administrative (8,523) (33,463) (41,986) (40,373) (1,613) (4.0) %\nAmortization expense (911) - (911) - (911) (100.0) %\nInterest expense (265) (2,588) (2,853) (3,120) 267 8.6 %\nOther gains, net 6,395 4,889 11,284 4,089 7,195 176.0 %\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes 7,751 9,090 16,841 2,132 14,709 (689.9) %\nIncome tax benefit (expense) 398 (1,630) (1,232) (11,388) 10,156 89.2 %\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations 8,149 7,460 15,609 (9,256) 24,865 268.6 %\nNet loss from discontinued operations - - - (1,712) 1,712 100.0 %\n1 favorable (unfavorable) change\n2 the change is calculated by comparing the results of operations for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period, to the results of operations for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022\nNet Revenue:\nConsolidated net revenue from continuing operations, for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period, decreased by approximately $14.2 million, as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. This decrease in net revenue was\nprimarily driven by lower volumes, lower demand and loss of certain programs in the medical devices electronics markets. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on the net revenue for the combined fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in the prior year.\nCost of Revenue:\nConsolidated cost of revenue from continuing operations consists primarily of expenses related to the cost of materials purchased in connection with the provision of supply chain management services as well as costs for salaries and benefits, contract labor, consulting, fulfillment and shipping, and applicable facilities costs. Supply Chain's cost of revenue decreased by $24.0 million for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $22.4 million decrease in materials procured on behalf of clients. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on the cost of revenue for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period, as compared to the same period in the prior year.\nGross Profit:\nSupply Chain's gross profit percentage for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period increased 670 basis points to 27.1% from 20.4% in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in value added revenue of $8.2 million, driven by clients in the computing and consumer electronics markets. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on Supply Chain's gross margin for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period, as compared to the same period in the prior year.\nSelling, General and Administrative:\nConsolidated selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") from continuing operations consist primarily of compensation and employee-related costs, sales commissions and incentive plans, information technology expenses, travel expenses, facilities costs, consulting fees, fees for professional services, depreciation expense, marketing expenses, share-based compensation expense, transaction costs, restructuring and public reporting costs. SG&A expenses for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period increased by approximately $1.6 million, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to Corporate-level activity. Corporate-level activity increased by $1.3 million, primarily due to an increase in professional and legal fees related to the Exchange Transaction. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on SG&A expenses for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period as compared to the same period in the prior year.\nAmortization Expense:\nAmortization expense for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period was $0.9 million and was driven by the recognition of intangible assets in connection with the application of pushdown accounting as a result of the Exchange Transaction. The Exchange Transaction closed on May 1, 2023, and as such, there was no activity for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022.\nInterest Expense:\nTotal interest expense, net, for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period remained relatively flat compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022.\nOther Gains, Net:\nOther gains, net are primarily composed of investment gains, foreign exchange gains (losses), interest income, and sublease income.\nOther gains, net for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period and the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 were $11.3 million and $4.1 million, respectively.\nOther gains, net for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period was primarily due to: (1) $5.1 million realized gains on the disposition of the Aerojet shares received in the Exchange Transaction, (2) $2.3 million gain from proceeds received from the sale of an investment in Tallan, Inc., (3) $1.6 million interest income, primarily earned on money market funds, (4) $1.4 million settlement with a client, and (5) $1.0 million sublease income. This activity was partially offset by $0.5 million unrealized loss on the fair value remeasurement of the SPHG Note.\nOther gains, net for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 included: (1) net realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains of $2.4 million, (2) gains of $0.9 million from the derecognition of accrued pricing liabilities, and (3) $0.7 million of sublease income.\nIncome Tax Expense:\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of approximately $1.2 million and $11.4 million for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period and the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, respectively. The decrease in income tax expenses for the year ended July 31, 2023 is primarily due to the income tax expense incurred during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 associated with an increase in the valuation allowance recorded on deferred tax assets as a result of the IWCO Direct disposal.\nNet Income from Continuing Operations:\nNet income from continuing operations for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period increased $24.9 million, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in net income from continuing operations is primarily due to: (1) $9.8 million increase in gross profit primarily driven by lower cost of materials and an increase in value added revenue, (2) $7.2 million increase in other gains, net, and (3) $10.2 million decrease in income tax expense. This activity was partially offset by $1.6 million increase in SG&A expenses, and $0.9 million of amortization expense related to intangibles recorded as a result of pushdown accounting. See above explanations for further details.\nNet Loss from Discontinued Operations:\nNet loss from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 was $1.7 million, and reflects the net loss for IWCO Direct. IWCO Direct was deconsolidated in February 2022, and as such, there was no activity from discontinued operations for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period. See Note 4 - \"Discontinued Operations\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in \"Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" included in this Annual Report.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAnticipated Sources and Uses of Cash Flow\nHistorically, the Company has financed its operations and met its capital requirements primarily through funds generated from operations, the sale of its securities, borrowings from lending institutions and sale of facilities that were not fully utilized. As a result of the Exchange Transaction the Company received approximately $202.7 million of Aerojet common stock, all of which has been sold or settled in cash as a result of Aerojet being acquired by L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (\"L3Harris). As of July 31, 2023, the Company had a receivable of $154.5 million for proceeds from the L3Harris transaction, which were received in August 2023. The Company believes it has access to adequate resources to meet its needs for normal operating costs, debt obligations and working capital for at least the next twelve months from the date of filing this Form 10-K. The following table summarizes our liquidity:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\n(In thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 121,372 $ 53,142\nReadily available borrowing capacity under Umpqua Revolver $ 11,890 11,890\n$ 133,262 $ 65,032\nDue to the changes reflected in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 (\"U.S. Tax Reform\"), there is no U.S. tax payable upon repatriating the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries considered not subject to permanent investment. Foreign withholding taxes would range from 0% to 10% on any repatriated funds. For the Company, earnings and profits have been calculated at each subsidiary. The Company's foreign subsidiaries are in an overall net deficit for earnings and profits purposes. As such, no adjustment was made to U.S. taxable income in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 relating to this aspect of the U.S. Tax Reform. In future years, the Company believes that it will be able to repatriate its foreign earnings without incurring additional U.S. tax as a result of a 100% dividends received deduction. The Company believes that any future withholding taxes or state taxes associated with such a repatriation would be minor. However, foreign laws may delay or add cost to any repatriation of cash from outside the U.S., which costs or delays may be significant.\nConsolidated net working capital was $251.5 million at July 31, 2023, compared with $26.0 million at July 31, 2022. Included in net working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $121.4 million at July 31, 2023 and $53.1 million at July 31,\n2022. The improvement in net working capital was primarily related to $202.7 million of Aerojet shares received in connection with the Exchange Transaction, which the Company sold all of its interest in as of July 31, 2023 for net proceeds of $207.8 million. The majority of Aerojet common stock were purchased when L3 Harris closed its merger with Aerojet. As of July 31, 2023, the Company had received $53.3 million in cash, with the remaining $154.5 million as a receivable.\nThe following summarizes the sources and uses of cash for the Predecessor and Successor periods, which relate to the periods preceding and period succeeding the Exchange Transaction with Steel Holdings, respectively. The sources and uses of cash for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period and the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 are comparable unless otherwise noted that as a result of pushdown accounting the periods are not comparable.\nSuccessor Predecessor Predecessor\nMay 1 to July 31, 2023 August 1, 2022 to April 30, 2023 Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2022 Change\n(In thousands)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 8,523 $ 9,000 $ 17,523 $ (3,134) $ 20,657\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities 52,838 736 $ 53,574 (1,485) 55,059\nNet cash used in financing activities (3,825) (2,780) $ (6,605) (2,297) (4,308)\nOperating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $17.5 million for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period, compared to $3.1 million net cash used by operating activities for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. The Company's future cash flows related to operating activities are dependent on several factors, including profitability, accounts receivable collections, effective inventory management practices and optimization of the credit terms of certain vendors of the Company, and overall performance of the technology sector impacting the Supply Chain segment. The increase in cash provided by operating activities compared to cash used in operating activities in the prior fiscal year was primarily due to more efficient accounts receivable management resulting in a favorable change of $16.6 million.\nInvesting Activities: Net cash provided by investing activities was $53.6 million for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period, and was driven primarily by proceeds from the sale of securities, specifically: (1) $53.3 million received for the disposal of the Company's interest in Aerojet; and (2) $2.3 million received related to the Company's previously held interest in Tallan, Inc. This activity was partially offset by $2.1 million in capital expenditures.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.5 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 and is related to capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities: The $6.6 million of cash used in financing activities for the Combined Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023 Period was related to: (1) $2.3 million payments for fractional shares resulting from Reverse/Forward Stock Split; (2) $2.0 million repayments on the SPHG Note and $0.1 million financing costs for the SPHG Note amendment; and (3) $2.1 million payment of preferred dividends.\nThe $2.3 million of cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 was primarily due to $2.1 million payment of preferred dividends.\nFollowing is a summary of Companys outstanding debt and financing agreements and preferred stock. Refer to Note 10 - \"Debt\" and Note 25 - \"Related Party Transactions\" to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\n7.50% Convertible Senior Note\nOn February 28, 2019, the Company entered into that certain 7.50% Convertible Senior Note Due 2024 Purchase Agreement with SPHG Holdings whereby SPHG Holdings loaned the Company $14.9 million in exchange for a 7.50% Convertible Senior Note due 2024 (the \"SPHG Note\"). The SPHG Note bears interest at the fixed rate of 7.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2019. The SPHG Note was scheduled to mature on March 1, 2024 (the \"original SPHG Note Maturity Date\"), unless earlier repurchased by the Company or converted by the holder in accordance with its terms prior to such maturity date.\nOn March 9, 2023 (the \"Amendment Date\"), the Company and SPHG Holdings entered into the SPHG Note Amendment. Pursuant to the SPHG Note Amendment, the maturity date of the SPHG Note was extended six months to September 1, 2024 (the \"new SPHG Note Maturity Date\"). In addition, the Company repaid $1.0 million in principal amount of the SPHG Note on the Amendment Date, and repaid an additional $1.0 million principal amount of the note on June 9, 2023. In connection with the SPHG Note Amendment, the Company paid SPHG Holdings a cash amendment fee of $0.1 million. The SPHG Note will mature on September 1, 2024, unless earlier repurchased by the Company or converted by the holder in accordance with its terms prior to such maturity date.\nAt its election, the Company may pay some or all of the interest due on each interest payment date by increasing the principal amount of the SPHG Note in the amount of such interest due or any portion thereof (such payment of interest by increasing the principal amount of the SPHG Note referred to as \"PIK Interest\"), with the remaining portion of the interest due on such interest payment date (or, at the Company's election, the entire amount of interest then due) to be paid in cash by the Company. Following an increase in the principal amount of the SPHG Note as a result of a payment of PIK Interest, the SPHG Note will bear interest on such increased principal amount from and after the date of such payment of PIK Interest. SPHG Holdings has the right to require the Company to repurchase the SPHG Note upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes, subject to certain conditions, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the SPHG Note plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company will have the right to elect to cause the mandatory conversion of the SPHG Note in whole, and not in part, at any time on or after March 6, 2022, subject to certain conditions including that the stock price of the Company exceeds a certain threshold. SPHG Holdings has the right, at its option, prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the SPHG Note Maturity Date, to convert the SPHG Note or a portion thereof that is $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, into shares of common stock (if the Company has not received a required stockholder approval) or cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, as applicable (if the Company has received a required stockholder approval), at an initial conversion rate of 45.1356 shares of common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $22.16 per share (subject to adjustment as provided in the SPHG Note) per $1,000 principal amount of the SPHG Note (the \"Conversion Rate\"), subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the SPHG Note. For any conversion of the SPHG Note, if the Company is required to obtain and has not received approval from its stockholders in accordance with Nasdaq Stock Market Rule 5635 to issue 20% or more of the total shares of common stock outstanding upon conversion (including upon any mandatory conversion) of the SPHG Note prior to the relevant conversion date (or, if earlier, the 45th scheduled trading day immediately preceding the SPHG Note Maturity Date), the Company shall deliver to the converting holder, in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of the SPHG Note being converted, a number of shares of common stock determined by reference to the Conversion Rate, together with a cash payment, if applicable, in lieu of delivering any fractional share of common stock based on the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of its common stock on the relevant conversion date, on the third business day immediately following the relevant conversion date.\nOn May 1, 2023, as a result of pushdown accounting related to the Exchange Transaction, the carrying value of the SPHG Note was remeasured to $13.0 million, which represents its fair value. As of May 1, 2023, the Company will now account for the SPHG Note under the fair value option, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. As of July 31, 2023 the carrying value of the outstanding debt consisted of the $12.9 million SPHG Note due September 1, 2024. As of July 31, 2023, the fair value of the SPHG Note was $12.5 million. As of July 31, 2022, outstanding debt consisted of the $14.9 million SPHG Note due March 1, 2024. As of July 31, 2022, the net carrying value of the SPHG Note was $11.0 million.\nThe SPHG Note was not settled in connection with the Exchange Transaction and remains outstanding as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report.\nUmpqua Revolver\nOn March 16, 2022, ModusLink, as borrower, submitted a notice of termination to MidCap Financial Trust for its $12.5\nmillion revolving credit facility (the MidCap Credit Facility), and entered into a new credit agreement with Umpqua Bank (the Umpqua Revolver), as lender and as agent.

There were no fees associated with the extension. As of April 30, 2023, there were $43.4 thousand of unamortized debt issuance costs recorded to other current assets, which were eliminated with the application of pushdown accounting. Refer to Note 3 - \"Exchange Transaction\" for further details.\nAs of July 31, 2023, ModusLink was in compliance with the Umpqua Revolver's covenants, and believes it will remain in compliance with the Umpqua Revolvers covenants for the next twelve months.

On February 25, 2022, the Company transferred all of its interests in IWCO Direct and the financial obligations of the Cerberus Credit Facility as part of the IWCO Direct Disposal. As a result, the Company has no debt or access to future borrowings under the Cerberus Credit Facility.\nSeries C Preferred Stock\nOn December 15, 2017, the Company entered into a Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") with SPHG Holdings, pursuant to which the Company issued 35,000 shares of the Company's newly created Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per shares, or the Preferred Stock, to SPHG Holdings at a price of $1,000 per share, for an aggregate purchase consideration of $35.0 million (the \"Preferred Stock Transaction\"). The terms, rights, obligations and preferences of the Preferred Stock are set forth in a Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the \"Series C Certificate of Designations\"), which has been filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.\nUnder the Series C Certificate of Designations, each share of Preferred Stock can be converted into shares of the Company's Common Stock at an initial conversion price equal to $18.29 per share, subject to appropriate adjustments for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction. Holders of the Preferred Stock will also receive dividends at 6% per annum payable, at the Company's option, in cash or Common Stock. If at any time the closing bid price of the Company's Common Stock exceeds 170% of the conversion price for at least five consecutive trading days (subject to appropriate adjustments for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction), the Company has the right to require each holder of Preferred Stock to convert all, or any whole number, of shares of the Preferred Stock into Common Stock.\nUpon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, either voluntary or involuntary, or the merger or consolidation of the Company or significant subsidiary, or the sale of substantially all of the assets or capital stock of the Company or a significant subsidiary, the holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or funds of the Company to the holders of other equity or equity equivalent securities of the Company other than the Preferred Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share in cash equal to the sum of (i) 100% of the stated value per share of Preferred Stock (initially $1,000 per share) then held by them (as adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or other similar transactions with respect to the Preferred Stock), plus (ii) 100% of all declared but unpaid dividends, and all accrued but unpaid dividends on each such share of Preferred Stock, in each case as the date of the triggering event.\nOn or after December 15, 2022, each holder of Preferred Stock can also require the Company to redeem its Preferred Stock in cash at a price equal to the Liquidation Preference (as defined in the Series C Certificate of Designations), or approximately $35.0 million. If holders of the Preferred Stock exercise this right to require the Company to redeem all the Preferred Stock, the Company may have insufficient liquidity to pay the redemption price, or the Companys payment of the redemption price would likely adversely impact the Companys liquidity and ability to finance its operations.\nSeries E Preferred Stock\nOn May 1, 2023, the Company and Steel Holdings executed a series of agreements in which the Steel Partners Group agreed to transfer certain marketable securities held by the Steel Partners Group to Steel Connect in exchange for 3.5 million shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock of Steel Connect (the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, and, such transfer the Transfer and Exchange Agreement). Following the approval by the Company's stockholders at the special stockholders' meeting held on June 6, 2023 pursuant to NASDAQ Marketplace Rules (the Stockholder Approval), the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into an aggregate of 19.8 million shares of the Companys common stock (the Common Stock), and will vote together with the Common Stock and participate in any dividends paid on the Common Stock, in each case on an as-converted basis.\nThe terms, rights, obligations and preferences of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock are set forth in a Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the Series E Certificate of Designations), which are summarized below:\nAny holder of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock (Holder), may, at its option, convert all or any shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock held by such Holder into Common Stock based on a conversion price of $10.27 (the Conversion Price) per share, subject to appropriate adjustments for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, or similar transaction by delivering to the Company a conversion notice.\nHolders are entitled to participate equally and ratably with the holders of shares of Common Stock in all dividends or other distributions on the shares of Common Stock as if, immediately prior to each record date for payment of dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock, shares of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding were converted into shares of Common Stock. Dividends or other distributions payable will be payable on the same date that such dividends or other distributions are payable to holders of shares of Common Stock, and no dividends or other distributions will be payable to holders of shares of Common Stock unless dividends or such other distributions are also paid at the same time in respect of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock.\nUpon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, either voluntary or involuntary, any merger or consolidation in which the Company is a constituent party or a Significant Subsidiary is a constituent party and the Company issues shares of its capital stock pursuant to such merger or consolidation such that the stockholders of the Company prior to such merger or consolidation hold less than 50.0% of the aggregate voting securities of the Corporation following such merger or consolidation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets or capital stock of the Company or a significant subsidiary (collectively, or any of these, a Liquidation Event(s)), the holders of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or funds of the Company to the holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share in cash equal to $58.1087 (as adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination or other similar transactions with respect to the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock Liquidation Preference). In the event that the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock Liquidation Preference is not paid with respect to any shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock as required to be paid, such shares shall continue to be entitled to dividends and all such shares shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided within the Series E Certificate of Designations.\nNeither the Company nor the Holder has any rights to redeem the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock.\nEach Holder of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to vote with holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock, voting together as a single class, with respect to any and all matters presented to the stockholders of the Company for their action or consideration (whether at a meeting of stockholders of the Company, by written action of stockholders in lieu of a meeting or otherwise), except as provided by law. In any such vote, each Holder shall be entitled to a number of votes equal to the largest number of whole shares of Common Stock into which all shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock held of record by such Holder is convertible as of the record date for such vote or written consent or, if there is no specified record date, as of the date of such vote or written consent.\nThe Company's stockholders approved the issuance of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock at the special stockholders' meeting held on June 6, 2023.\nSteel Connect, Inc.(as parent company, the Parent)\nThe Parent believes it has access to adequate resources to meet its needs for normal operating costs, debt obligations and working capital for at least the next twelve months.\nModusLink believes that if dividends to the Parent are required, it would have access to adequate resources to meet its operating needs while remaining in compliance with the Umpqua Revolver's covenants over the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurances that ModusLink will continue to have access to its line of credit if its financial performance does not satisfy the financial covenants set forth in its financing agreement, which could also result in the acceleration of its debt obligations by its lender, adversely affecting liquidity.\nContractual Obligations\nOur principal uses of cash will be to provide working capital, meet debt service requirements, fund capital expenditures and execute managements strategic plans. As of July 31, 2023, we had contractual cash obligations to repay debt, make\npayments under operating leases, and make dividend payments. As of July 31, 2023, payments due under these long-term obligations are as follows:\nLess than 1 year 2-3 years 4-5 years More than 5 years Total\n(In thousands)\nDebt(1)\n$ - $ 12,940 $ - $ - $ 12,940\nInterest payments(2)\n1,019 496 - - 1,515\nOperating lease liabilities 9,256 13,684 6,386 544 29,870\nSeries C Preferred dividend payments 2,100 4,200 4,200 10,500\n(1) Represents principal amount of debt and only includes scheduled principal payments.\n(2) Represents expected interest payments on debt. Interest payments based on variable interest rates were determined using the interest rate in effect as of July 31, 2023.\nHolders of the Preferred Stock receive dividends at 6% per annum. In addition, beginning December 15, 2022, each holder of the Preferred Stock can require the Company to redeem its Preferred Stock in cash at a price equal to the Liquidation Preference (as defined in Series C Certificate of Designations).\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 - \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to our audited consolidated financial statements. The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant of these estimates and assumptions relate to: (1) revenue recognition; (2) valuation allowances for trade and other receivables and inventories; (3) the valuation of long-lived assets; (4) contingencies, including litigation reserves; (5) restructuring charges and related severance expenses; (6) income taxes; (7) pension obligations; (8) business combinations; and (9) incremental borrowing rates to determine present value of lease payments. Of the accounting estimates we routinely make relating to our critical accounting policies, those estimates made in the process of: recognition of revenue; determining the valuation of inventory and related reserves; accounting for impairment of long-lived assets; and establishing income tax valuation allowances and liabilities are the estimates most likely to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in estimates are reflected in the periods in which they become known. However, because these estimates inherently involve judgments and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those estimates.\nWe believe that our critical accounting estimates have the following attributes: (1) we are required to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain and require judgment at the time of the estimate; (2) use of reasonably different assumptions could have changed our estimates, particularly with respect to recoverability of assets; and (3) changes in the estimate could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe the critical accounting policies below contain the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:\nRevenue recognition\nIncome taxes\nLeases\nAcquisition accounting\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from its contracts with customers primarily from the sale of supply chain management services. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. For ModusLinks supply chain management services arrangements, the services are considered to be transferred over time as they are performed. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue.\nSupply chain management services\nModusLinks revenue primarily comes from the sale of supply chain management services to its clients. Amounts billed to customers under these arrangements include revenue attributable to the services performed as well as for materials procured on the customer's behalf as part of its service to them. The majority of these arrangements consist of two distinct performance obligations (i.e, warehousing/inventory management service and a separate kitting/packaging/assembly service), revenue related to each of which is recognized over time as services are performed using an input method based on the level of efforts expended.\nOther\nOther revenue consists of cloud-based software subscriptions, software maintenance and support service contracts, fees for professional services and fees for the sale of perpetual software licenses in ModusLinks e-Business operations. Except for perpetual software licenses, revenue related to these arrangements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement or over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs incurred in satisfying the obligations under the contract.\nPerformance Obligations and Standalone Selling Price\nThe Companys contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require certain judgment. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. The Company generally determines standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers and uses a range of amounts to estimate standalone selling prices when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount that needs to be allocated based on the relative standalone selling prices of the various products and services. The Company typically has more than one range of standalone selling prices for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, the Company may use information such as the type of customer and geographic region in determining the range of standalone selling prices.\nVariable Consideration\nThe Company may provide credits or incentives to customers, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the transaction price of the contract and amounts of revenue to recognize. The amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price is estimated at contract inception using either the estimated value method or the most likely amount method based on the nature of the variable consideration. These estimates are updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available and revenue is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of any amounts of variable consideration included in the transaction price will not occur.\nPrincipal Versus Agent Revenue Recognition\nFor revenue generated from contracts with customers involving another party, the Company considers whether it maintains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment and discretion in establishing price. Revenues are recognized on a gross basis if the Company is acting in the capacity of a principal and on a net basis if its acting in the capacity of an agent.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately $369.9 million and $138.8 million, respectively, as of July 31, 2023. As of July 31, 2023, approximately $1.7 billion of net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes expired. Income taxes are accounted for under the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes (\"ASC 740\"), using the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. This methodology is subjective and\nrequires significant estimates and judgments in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets and in the calculation of certain tax liabilities. As of July 31, 2023 and 2022, a valuation allowance has been recorded against the deferred tax asset in the U.S. and certain of its foreign subsidiaries since management believes that after considering all the available objective evidence, both positive and negative, historical and prospective, with greater weight given to historical evidence, it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized. In each reporting period, we evaluate the adequacy of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. In the future, if the Company is able to demonstrate a consistent trend of pre-tax income, then at that time management may reduce its valuation allowance accordingly. The Company also performs a valuation allowance scheduling exercise based on the deferred tax assets and liabilities as of July 31, 2023.\nIn addition, the calculation of the Company's tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in several tax jurisdictions. The Company is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, we record estimated reserves for exposures. Based on our evaluation of current tax positions, the Company believes it has appropriately accrued for exposures as of July 31, 2023.\nLeases\nIn order to calculate the operating ROU asset and operating lease liability for a lease, a lessee is required to apply a discount rate equal to the rate implicit in the lease whenever that rate is readily determinable. The Company's lease agreements generally do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate, nor is the rate available to the Company from its lessors and, therefore, the Company determines an incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate represents the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar lease term to obtain an asset of similar value.\nAcquisition Accounting\nThe Exchange Transaction with Steel Holdings was accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805) with Steel Holdings being the accounting acquirer. The Company elected to apply pushdown accounting. As required by ASC 805, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their respective fair values as of the business combination date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Significant judgement is required in determining the acquisition date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed predominantly with respect to debt and intangible assets. We use available information to make these fair value determinations and, when necessary, engage an independent valuation specialist to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long-lived assets. Significant judgment may be used to determine these fair values, including the use of appraisals, discounted cash flow models, market value for similar purchases or other methods applicable to the circumstances. The assumptions and judgments made by the Company when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations in the future. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nAlthough the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired. Judgment is also required in determining the intangible assets useful life.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of the Company's new or recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 - \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nTax Benefits Preservation Plan\nOur past operations generated significant net operating losses, or NOLs. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which among, other things, amends the treatment of NOLs. Under federal tax laws, for NOLs arising in tax years beginning before January 1, 2018, we generally can use any such NOLs and certain related tax credits to reduce ordinary income tax paid in our prior two tax years or on our future taxable income for up to 20 years, at which point they \"expire\" for such purposes. Until they expire, we can \"carry forward\" NOLs and certain related tax credits that we do not use in any particular year to offset taxable income in future years. For NOLs\narising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021, we are allowed to carryback such NOLs to each of the five taxable years preceding the taxable year of such losses and generally can use any such NOLs and certain related tax credits to reduce ordinary income tax paid on our future taxable income indefinitely. For NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020, we generally can use such NOLs and certain related tax credits to reduce ordinary income tax paid on our future taxable income indefinitely; however, any such NOLs cannot be used to reduce ordinary income tax paid in prior tax years. In addition, the deduction for NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020 is limited to 80% of our taxable income for any tax year (computed without regard to the NOL deduction and subject to certain other adjustments). NOLs arising in tax years beginning before January 1, 2018, are referred to herein as \"Current NOLs.\" The Company had net NOL carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately $369.9 million and $138.8 million, respectively, at July 31, 2023. Of the total U.S. federal NOLs, $96.6 million does not expire and the remaining carry-forwards of $273.3 million will expire at various dates beginning in 2024 through 2038. We cannot estimate the exact amount of NOLs that we will be able use to reduce future income tax liability because we cannot predict the amount and timing of our future taxable income. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Taxation-We may be unable to realize the benefits of our net operating loss carry-forwards and other tax benefits (collectively, the \u2018NOLs or \u2018Tax Benefits).\nIn early 2018, Company's board of directors adopted the Protective Amendment and Tax Plan, each designed to preserve the Company's ability to utilize its NOLs, by preventing an \"ownership change\" within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code that would impair the Company's ability to utilize its NOLs. Later that year, the stockholders of Steel Connect approved the Protective Amendment and Tax Plan.\nThe federal NOLs will expire from fiscal year 2023 through 2038, and the state NOL will expire from fiscal year 2023 through 2041. The Company's ability to use its Tax Benefits would be substantially limited if the Company undergoes an Ownership Change. The Protective Amendment and Tax Plan are intended to prevent an Ownership Change of the Company that would impair the Company's ability to utilize its Tax Benefits.\nThe Protective Amendment generally restricts any direct or indirect transfer if the effect would be to (i) increase the direct, indirect or constructive ownership of any stockholder from less than 4.99% to 4.99% or more of the shares of common stock then outstanding or (ii) increase the direct, indirect or constructive ownership of any stockholder owning or deemed to own 4.99% or more of the shares of common stock then outstanding. Pursuant to the Protective Amendment, any direct or indirect transfer attempted in violation of the Protective Amendment would be void as of the date of the prohibited transfer as to the purported transferee (or, in the case of an indirect transfer, the ownership of the direct owner of the shares would terminate simultaneously with the transfer), and the purported transferee (or in the case of any indirect transfer, the direct owner) would not be recognized as the owner of the shares owned in violation of the Protective Amendment (the \"excess stock\") for any purpose, including for purposes of voting and receiving dividends or other distributions in respect of such shares, or in the case of options, receiving shares in respect of their exercise. In addition to a prohibited transfer being void as of the date it is attempted, upon demand, the purported transferee must transfer the excess stock to an agent of the Company along with any dividends or other distributions paid with respect to such excess stock. The agent is required to sell such excess stock in an arm's-length transaction (or series of transactions) that would not constitute a violation under the Protective Amendment.\nAs part of the Tax Plan, the Board declared a dividend of one right (a Right) for each share of common stock then outstanding. The dividend was payable to holders of record as of the close of business on January 29, 2018. Any shares of common stock issued after January 29, 2018, will be issued together with the Rights. Each Right initially represents the right to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of newly created Series D Junior Participating Preferred Stock.\nInitially, the Rights will be attached to all certificates representing shares of common stock then outstanding, and no separate rights certificates will be distributed. In the case of book entry shares, the Rights will be evidenced by notations in the book entry accounts. Subject to certain exceptions specified in the Tax Plan, the Rights will separate from the common stock and a distribution date (the Distribution Date) will occur upon the earlier of (i) ten (10) business days following a public announcement that a stockholder (or group) has become a beneficial owner of 4.99% or more of the shares of common stock then outstanding or (ii) ten (10) business days (or such later date as the Board determines) following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in a person or group becoming a 4.99% stockholder.\nPursuant to the Tax Plan and subject to certain exceptions, if a stockholder (or group) becomes a new 4.99% stockholder after adoption of the Tax Plan, the Rights would generally become exercisable and entitle stockholders (other than the new 4.99% stockholder or group) to purchase additional shares of the Company at a significant discount, resulting in substantial dilution in the economic interest and voting power of the 4.99% stockholder (or group). In addition, under certain circumstances in which the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination after a non-exempt stockholder (or group) becomes a 4.99% stockholder, each holder of the Right (other than the 4.99% stockholder or group) would then be entitled to purchase shares of the acquiring company's common stock at a discount.\nThe Protective Amendment does not expire. The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date and will expire at 11:59 p.m., on January 18, 2024, unless the Rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged as provided in the Tax Plan or the Board of Directors earlier determines that the Tax Plan is no longer necessary or desirable for the preservation of the Tax Benefits. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Taxation-We may be unable to realize the benefits of our net operating loss carry-forwards and other tax benefits (collectively, the \u2018NOLs or \u2018Tax Benefits). ITEM 7A.- QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nConsistent with the rules applicable to \"Smaller Reporting Companies\" we have omitted information required by this Item. ITEM 8.- FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (Name: BDO USA, P.C.; New York, New York; PCAOB No. 243)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets at July 31, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the periods from May 1 to July 31, 2023 (Successor) and August 1, 2022 to April 30, 2023 (Predecessor) and for the year ended July 31, 2022 (Predecessor)\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the periods from May 1 to July 31, 2023 (Successor) and August 1, 2022 to April 30, 2023 (Predecessor) and for the year ended July 31, 2022 (Predecessor)\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity (Deficit) for the periods from May 1 to July 31, 2023 (Successor) and August 1, 2022 to April 30, 2023 (Predecessor) and for the year ended July 31, 2022 (Predecessor)\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the periods from May 1 to July 31, 2023 (Successor) and August 1, 2022 to April 30, 2023 (Predecessor) and for the year ended July 31, 2022 (Predecessor)\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nSteel Connect, Inc.\nNew York, New York\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Steel Connect, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of July 31, 2023 (Successor) and 2022 (Predecessor), the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the period from May 1, 2023 through July 1, 2023 (Successor), and the period from August 1, 2022 through April 30, 2023 and the year ended July 31, 2022 (Predecessor), and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at July 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from May 1, 2023 through July 1, 2023 (Successor), and the period from August 1, 2022 through April 30, 2023 and the year ended July 31, 2022 (Predecessor) in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nBusiness Combination - Valuation of Intangible Assets\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company and Steel Partners Holdings L.P., (Steel Holdings) executed a series of agreements in which Steel Holdings and certain of its affiliates transferred certain marketable securities to the Company in exchange for 3.5 million shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the Exchange Transaction). The Exchange Transaction was accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, Business Combinations, and, accordingly, the Company's results of operations were consolidated in Steel Holding's financial statements on the date of the Exchange Transaction. The Company elected pushdown accounting in which it uses Steel Holding's basis of accounting, which reflects the fair market value of the Companys assets and liabilities at the date of the Exchange Transaction. The Company recognized a customer relationships intangible asset of $25.0 million and trade name intangible asset of $10.5 million in connection with the Exchange Transaction. The fair value of the trade name asset was determined using the relief-from-royalty method and the fair value of the customer relationships asset was determined using the excess earnings method. These income-based approaches included assumptions such as the amount and timing of projected cash flows and discount rate.\nWe identified the determination of fair values of the customer relationships and trade name intangible assets as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination are the significant and subjective judgments made by management in utilizing significant assumptions to determine the fair value of customer relationships and trade name intangible assets. For the customer relationships and trade name intangible assets, these significant assumptions were the projected revenue and discount rate. Auditing these elements involved especially challenging and subjective auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skills and knowledge needed.\nThe primary procedure we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\nEvaluating the reasonableness of projected revenue used in the determination of the fair value of the customer relationships and trade name intangible assets by comparing the projected revenue against historical financial results, guideline companies, and industry information.\nUtilizing personnel with specialized knowledge and skills in valuation to evaluate the reasonableness of the discount rate used in the determination of the fair value of the customer relationships and trade name intangible assets.\n/s/ BDO USA, P.C.\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2014.\nNew York, NY\nNovember 8, 2023\nSTEEL CONNECT, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(1)NATURE OF OPERATIONS\nSteel Connect, Inc., (the \"Company\" or \"Steel Connect\"), is a holding company which operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary ModusLink Corporation (\"ModusLink\" or \"Supply Chain\").\nModusLink is a supply chain business process management company serving clients in markets such as consumer electronics, communications, computing, medical devices, software and retail. ModusLink designs and executes elements in its clients' global supply chains to improve speed to market, product customization, flexibility, cost, quality and service. The Company also produces and licenses an entitlement management solution for activation, provisioning, entitlement subscription and data collection from physical goods (connected products) and digital products.\nSteel Partners and Steel Connect Exchange Transaction\nOn April 30, 2023, Steel Partners Holdings L.P., (Steel Holdings) and the Company executed a series of agreements in which Steel Holdings and certain of its affiliates (the Steel Partners Group) agreed to transfer certain marketable securities held by the Steel Partners Group to the Company in exchange for 3.5 million shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, and, such transfer and related transactions, the Exchange Transaction). Following approval on June 6, 2023 by the Company's stockholders, pursuant to NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into an aggregate of 19.8 million shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the common stock or Common Stock), and will vote together with the Company's common stock and participate in any dividends paid on the Company's common stock, in each case on an as-converted basis. Upon conversion of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, the Steel Partners Group would hold approximately 84.0% of the outstanding equity interests of the Company. The Exchange Transaction closed on May 1, 2023, which is the date that the consideration was exchanged between Steel Holdings and the Company.\nPredecessor/Successor Reporting\nOn May 1, 2023, the Exchange Transaction resulted in Steel Holdings obtaining control of the Company for financial statement consolidation purposes. Steel Holdings does not consolidate the Company for Federal income tax purposes because the ownership in the Company is dispersed between different federal tax consolidation groups within Steel Holdings. The Company elected pushdown accounting in which it uses Steel Holdings' basis of accounting, which reflects the fair market value of the Companys assets and liabilities at the date of the Exchange Transaction. As a result, the Company has reflected the required pushdown accounting adjustments in its consolidated financial statements. Due to the application of pushdown accounting, the Companys consolidated financial statements and certain footnote disclosures include a black line division between the two distinct periods to indicate the application of two different bases of accounting, which may not be comparable, between the periods presented. The pre- exchange period through April 30, 2023 is referred to as the \"Predecessor\" period. The post-exchange period, May 1, 2023 through July 31, 2023, includes the impact of pushdown accounting and is referred to as the \"Successor\" period. See Note 3 - \"Exchange Transaction\" for further information regarding the Exchange Transaction and the application of pushdown accounting.\nDisposition of Interest in Aerojet Shares\nAs a result of the Exchange Transaction, the Company recorded $202.7 million to investments, which represents the fair value of the Aerojet common stock transferred to Steel Connect. As of July 31, 2023, the Company had disposed of all its interest in Aerojet common stock. The majority of Aerojet common stock was purchased when L3 Harris closed its merger with Aerojet. As of July 31, 2023, the Company received $53.3 million in cash and had a receivable of $154.5 million for proceeds receivable, which was received in August 2023. The Company received total net proceeds of $207.8 million in exchange for all of its Aerojet shares.\nDisposition of IWCO Direct\nOn February 25, 2022, the Company entered into a transaction agreement (the Transaction Agreement) with (a) IWCO Direct Holding Inc. (''IWCO Direct\" or \"Direct Marketing\") and its indirect subsidiaries, (b) Cerberus Business Finance, LLC, in its capacities as collateral agent and administrative agent under a financing agreement (in such capacities, the Agent), dated as of December 15, 2017, between IWCO Direct, IWCO Directs direct and indirect subsidiaries, the Agent and the lenders party thereto (the Lenders) (the Financing Agreement), (c) the Lenders, (d) the Lenders or their respective designees listed on the signature pages to the Transaction Agreement under the caption Participating Lender Purchasers (the Participating Lender Purchasers), (e) SPH Group Holdings LLC (the Sponsor) and (f) Instant Web Holdings, LLC (the Buyer), an entity owned by the Participating Lender Purchasers. On the Effective Date (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) and\npursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, the Company transferred all of its interests in IWCO Direct to the Buyer as part of a negotiated restructuring of the capital structure and certain financial obligations of IWCO Direct under the Financing Agreement as contemplated by the Transaction Agreement. The assets and liabilities and results of operations of the IWCO Direct business are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 4 - \"Discontinued Operations\" for additional information.\nAll references made to financial data in this Annual Report are to the Company's continuing operations, unless otherwise specifically noted.\n(2)SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies described below.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company include the results of its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company accounts for investments in businesses in which it owns between 20% and 50% of the voting interest using the equity method, if the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee company. All other investments in privately held businesses over which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence, or for which there is not a readily determinable market value, are accounted for under the cost method of accounting.\nReverse/Forward Stock Split\nAt the special stockholders meeting held on June 6, 2023, the stockholders approved proposals to amend the Companys restated certificate of incorporation (the Charter), to effect a 1-for-3,500 reverse stock split of the common stock (the Reverse Stock Split), followed immediately by a 375-for-1 forward stock split of the common stock (the Forward Stock Split, and, together with the Reverse Stock Split, the Reverse/Forward Stock Split). On June 7, 2023, the Board approved the Reverse/Forward Stock Split, and as such, the Board directed the Company to file with the State of Delaware certificates of amendment to our Charter to effectuate the Reverse/Forward Stock Split. The Reverse/Forward Stock Split was effective on June 21, 2023 (the Effective Date). The Companys common stock began trading on a Reverse/Forward Stock Split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Capital Market when the market opened on June 22, 2023. The trading symbol for the Companys common stock remains STCN.\nNo fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse/Forward Stock Split. Shares held by stockholders who held fewer than 3,500 of the Companys common stock immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split were converted into the right to receive a payment in cash (without interest) equal to the fair value of such shares as of the time when those entitled to receive such payments were determined, which shall be an amount equal to such number of shares of Companys common stock held multiplied by the average of the closing sales prices of the Companys common stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split, and each share of Companys common stock held by a stockholder of record owning 3,500 shares or more immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split were converted into a new number of shares of Companys common stock based on a ratio of 375 shares of the Companys common stock for each share of the Companys common stock owned immediately following the Reverse Stock Split, including any fractional shares owned following the Reverse Stock Split; however, with respect to any fractions of a share of Company Common Stock that may be held as a result of the Forward Stock Split, stockholders received a payment in cash (without interest) equal to the fair value of such fractions as of the time when those entitled to receive such fractions are determined, which was an amount equal to such fractions multiplied by the average of the closing sales prices of the Companys common stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the effective date of the Reverse/Forward Stock Split (with such average closing sales prices being adjusted to give effect to the Reverse/Forward Stock Split). The Company made payments of $2.3 million related to fractional shares as a result of the Reverse/Forward Stock Split, which were recorded to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023.\nThe number of shares of authorized Companys common stock did not change as a result of the Reverse/Forward Stock Split; however, the number of shares of outstanding Companys common stock decreased as a result of the Reverse/Forward Stock Split.\nAccordingly, all share and per-share amounts for the current period and prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse/Forward Stock Split.\nThe number of shares of Companys common stock issuable upon the exercise of Series C Preferred Stock and the Series E Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Reverse/Forward Stock Split were proportionately decreased and the conversion price of the Series C Preferred Stock and the Series E Preferred Stock were proportionately increased, effective as of June 21, 2023, the close of business on the date of such Reverse/Forward Stock Split. Our authorized preferred stock was not affected by the reverse stock split and continues to be 3,535,000 shares of preferred stock, with a par value of $0.01 per share.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates including those related to: (1) revenue recognition; (2) valuation allowances for trade and other receivables; (3) the valuation of long-lived assets; (4) contingencies, including litigation reserves; (5) restructuring charges and related severance expenses; (6) income taxes; (7) pension obligations; (8) business combinations; and (9) incremental borrowing rate to determine present value of lease payments. Accounting estimates are based on historical experience and various assumptions that are considered reasonable under the circumstances. However, because these estimates inherently involve judgments and uncertainties, actual results could differ materially from those estimated.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from its contracts with customers primarily from the sale of supply chain management services. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. For ModusLink's supply chain management services arrangements, the goods and services are considered to be transferred over time as they are performed. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue.\nSupply Chain Management Services\nModusLink's revenue primarily comes from the sale of supply chain management services to its clients. Amounts billed to customers under these arrangements include revenue attributable to the services performed as well as for materials procured on the customer's behalf as part of its service to them. The majority of these arrangements consist of two distinct performance obligations (i.e., warehousing/inventory management service and a separate kitting/packaging/assembly service), revenue related to each of which is recognized over time as services are performed using an input method based on the level of efforts expended.\nOther\nOther revenue consists of cloud-based software subscriptions, software maintenance and support service contracts, and fees for professional services in ModusLink's e-Business operations. Revenue related to these arrangements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement or over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs incurred in satisfying the obligations under the contract.\nPerformance Obligations and Standalone Selling Price\nThe Company's contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require certain judgment. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. The Company generally determines standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers and uses a range of amounts to estimate standalone selling prices when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount that needs to be allocated based on the relative standalone selling prices of the various products and services. The Company typically has more than one range of standalone selling prices for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, the Company may use\ninformation such as the type of customer and geographic region in determining the range of standalone selling prices.\nVariable Consideration\nThe Company may provide credits or incentives to customers, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the transaction price of the contract and amounts of revenue to recognize. The amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price is estimated at contract inception using either the estimated value method or the most likely amount method based on the nature of the variable consideration. These estimates are updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available and revenue is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of any amounts of variable consideration included in the transaction price will not occur.\nPrincipal Versus Agent Revenue Recognition\nFor revenue generated from contracts with customers involving another party, the Company considers whether it maintains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment and discretion in establishing price. Revenues are recognized on a gross basis if the Company is acting in the capacity of a principal and on a net basis if its acting in the capacity of an agent.\nContract Balances\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from timing of invoicing to customers. The Company records contract assets and liabilities related to its contracts with customers as follows:\nAccounts receivable when revenue is recognized prior to receipt of cash payments and if the right to such amounts is unconditional and solely based on the passage of time.\nContract assets when the Company recognizes revenue based on efforts expended but the right to such amount is conditional upon satisfaction of another performance obligation. Contract assets are primarily comprised of fees related to supply chain management services. The Company's contract assets are all short-term in nature and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nDeferred revenue when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance. Deferred revenue is primarily comprised of fees related to supply chain management services, cloud-based software subscriptions and software maintenance and support service contracts, which are generally billed in advance. Deferred revenue also includes other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. The deferred revenue balance is classified as a component of other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Expected Credit Losses\nThe Company's unsecured accounts receivable are stated at original invoice amount less an estimate made for expected credit losses based on a monthly review of all outstanding amounts. Management determines the allowance for expected credit losses by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering each customer's financial condition, credit history, current economic conditions, whether any amounts are currently past due and the length of time accounts may be past due. The Company writes off accounts receivable when management deems them uncollectible and records recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off when received. When accounts receivable are considered past due, the Company generally does not charge interest on past due balances.\nThe allowance for expected credit losses consisted of the following:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nMay 1 to July 31, 2023 August 1, 2022 to April 30, 2023 July 31, 2022\n(In thousands)\nBalance at beginning of period $ 1,180 $ 44 $ 49\nApplication of pushdown accounting(a)\n(1,180) - -\nProvisions charged to expense 219 1,136 -\nAccounts written off - -\nRecovered - - (5)\nBalance at end of period $ 219 $ 1,180 $ 44\n(a) As part of pushdown accounting, the allowance for expected credit losses balance was eliminated to establish the new cost basis in the Company's accounts receivables as of May 1, 2023.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAll assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is the local currency, are translated to U.S. dollars at the rates in effect at the balance sheet date. All amounts in the consolidated statements of operations are translated using the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of stockholders' equity. Settlement of receivables and payables in a foreign currency that is not the functional currency result in foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in \"Other gains (losses), net\" in the consolidated statements of operations.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. Investments with maturities greater than three months to twelve months at the time of purchase are considered short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents consisted of the following:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\n(In thousands)\nCash and bank deposits $ 90,282 $ 21,386\nMoney market funds 31,090 31,756\n$ 121,372 $ 53,142\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value (see Note 23 - \"Fair Value Measurements\"). Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair values of assets and liabilities are determined based on a three-level measurement input hierarchy. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are other than quoted market prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for an asset or liability. Level 2 inputs can include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in a market that is not active for identical assets or liabilities, or other inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability when there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are based on the best information available and may include data developed by the Company.\nFunds Held for Clients\nFunds held for clients represent cash that is restricted for use solely for the purposes of satisfying the obligations to remit clients' customer funds to the Company's clients. These funds are classified as a current asset and a corresponding current liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by both moving averages and the first-in, first-out methods. A provision for excess or obsolete inventory is recorded based upon an analysis that considers current inventory levels, historical usage patterns and future sales expectations.\nAccounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company tests long-lived assets or group of assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the Company may not be able to recover the asset's carrying amount. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates recoverability generally by determining whether the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset or group cover the carrying value at the evaluation date. If the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value, the Company measures an impairment loss as the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or group over its fair value. Management may use third-party valuation experts to assist in its determination of fair value.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. The costs of additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization is computed by applying the straight-line method to the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Changes in estimated useful lives and salvage values of the Companys assets and the related depreciation and amortization expense are accounted for prospectively. The Company capitalizes certain computer software development costs when incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:\nCategory Useful Lives\nMachinery and equipment 5 years\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset\nSoftware 5 years\nComputer hardware 3 years\nOther 5 years\nLeases\nThe Company leases office space, warehouse facilities, equipment and automobiles under operating leases. These leases may also include rent escalation clauses or lease incentives in the form of construction allowances and rent reduction. In determining the lease term used in the lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and lease liability calculations, the Company considers various factors such as market conditions and the terms of any renewal or termination options that may exist. When deemed reasonably certain, the renewal and termination options are included in the determination of the lease term and calculation of the lease ROU asset and lease liability. The Company is typically required to make fixed minimum rent payments, variable rent payments primarily based on performance, or a combination thereof, directly related to its ROU asset. The Company is also often required, by the lease, to pay for certain other costs including real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance fees and/or certain other costs, which may be fixed or variable, depending upon the terms of the respective lease agreement. To the extent these payments are fixed, the Company has included them in calculating the lease ROU assets and lease liabilities.\nThe Company calculates lease ROU assets and lease liabilities as the present value of fixed lease payments over the reasonably certain lease term beginning at the commencement date. When discount rates implicit in leases cannot be readily determined, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The determination of incremental borrowing rates involves judgment by management. The weighted average interest rate used for operating leases for the year ended July 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022 was 5.2% and 3.9%, respectively. The weighted average interest rate used for finance leases for the year ended July 31, 2022 was 3.9%. There were no finance leases as of the year ended July 31, 2023.\nFor operating leases, fixed lease payments are recognized as operating lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, the ROU asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term, along with recognition of interest expense associated with accretion of the lease liability. For leases with a lease term of 12 months or less (\"short-term lease\"), any fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over such term and are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets. Variable lease cost for both operating and finance leases, if any, is recognized as incurred.\nRestructuring Costs\nRestructuring and other exit costs may include employee separation costs, asset impairment charges, contract exit costs and costs of facility consolidation and closure. The Company records restructuring and other exit costs at their fair value when incurred. In accordance with existing benefit arrangements, employee termination costs are accrued when the restructuring actions are probable and estimable. Employee separation costs may also include one-time termination benefits recognized as a liability at estimated fair value, at the time of communication to employees, unless future service is required beyond the minimum retention period, in which case the costs are recognized ratably over the future service period.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. This methodology is subjective and requires significant estimates and judgments in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets and in the calculation of certain tax liabilities.\nIncome tax accounting standards prescribe: (1) a minimum recognition threshold that an income tax benefit arising from an uncertain income tax position taken, or expected to be taken, on an income tax return is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and (2) the measurement of the income tax benefits recognized from such positions. The Company's accounting policy is to classify uncertain income tax positions that are not expected to be resolved in one year as non-current income tax liabilities and to classify potential interest and penalties on uncertain income tax positions as elements of the provision for income taxes in its financial statements. See Note 18 - \"Income Taxes,\" for additional information.\nPension Plans\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its employees in the Netherlands and Japan. In accordance with accounting standards for employee pension benefits, the Company recognizes on a plan-by-plan basis the unfunded status of its pension plans in the consolidated financial statements and measures its pension plan assets and benefit obligations as of July 31. The obligation for the Company's pension plans and the related annual costs of employee benefits are calculated based on several long-term assumptions, including discount rates and expected mortality for employee benefit liabilities, rates of return on plan assets and expected annual rates for salary increases for employee participants.\nShare-Based Compensation Plans\nAll share-based payment awards to employees and directors are measured based upon their grant date fair values and expensed over the period during which the employee or director is required to provide service in exchange for the award (the vesting period). The Company accounts for forfeitures in the period in which they occur.\nAcquisition Accounting\nThe Exchange Transaction with Steel Holdings was accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805) with Steel Holdings being the accounting acquirer. The Company elected to apply pushdown accounting. As required by ASC 805, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their respective fair values as of the business combination date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Significant judgement is required in determining the acquisition date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed predominantly with respect to debt and intangible assets. We use available information to make these fair value determinations and, when necessary, engage an independent valuation specialist to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long-lived assets. Significant judgment may be used to determine these fair values, including the use of appraisals, discounted cash flow models, market value for similar purchases or other methods applicable to the circumstances. The assumptions and judgments made by the Company when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations in the future. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date,\nthe Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nEarnings per Common Share\nThe Company calculates earnings (loss) per common share using the two-class method required for participating securities. Accordingly, the Company's Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, which the holders of are entitled to participate equally and ratably with the holders of shares of Common Stock in all dividends or other distributions on the shares of Common Stock, are included as participating securities in the calculation of earnings (loss) per common share (\"EPS\") pursuant to the two-class method.\nThe two-class method provides for an allocation of net income (loss) between common stock and other participating securities based on their respective participation rights to share in dividends. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Net income available to common stockholders for the period includes dividends paid to common stockholders during the period plus a proportionate share of undistributed net income allocable to common stockholders for the period; the proportionate share of undistributed net income allocable to common stockholders for the period is based on the proportionate share of total weighted-average common shares and participating securities outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period, plus potential common shares considered outstanding during the period, as long as the inclusion of such awards is not antidilutive. Potential common shares consist of restricted common stock (calculated based on the treasury stock method) and shares issuable upon debt or preferred stock conversion (calculated using an as-if converted method), using the more dilutive of either the two-class method or as-converted stock method.\nMajor Clients and Concentration of Credit Risk\nFor the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company's 10 largest clients accounted for approximately 83% and 78% of consolidated net revenue from continuing operations, respectively. Two customers accounted for approximately 41% and 13% of the Company's consolidated net revenue from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, and two customers accounted for 31% and 12% of the Company's consolidated net revenue from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. No other customers accounted for greater than 10% of consolidated net revenue in these periods. Four clients, associated with the Supply Chain segment, accounted for greater than 10% of the Company's consolidated net accounts receivables as of July 31, 2023. The first, second, third, and fourth client accounted for approximately 28%, 14%, 12%, and 10%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated net accounts receivable balance as of July 31, 2023. Three clients, associated with the Supply Chain segment, accounted for greater than 10% of the Company's consolidated net accounts receivables as of July 31, 2022. The first, second, and third client accounted for approximately 31%, 18%, and 17%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated net accounts receivable balance as of July 31, 2022.\nFinancial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company's cash equivalent portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of short-term investment grade securities placed with high credit quality financial institutions. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained at accredited financial institutions, and the balances associated with funds held for clients are at times without and in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has never experienced any losses related to these balances and does not believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with financial institutions.\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Loses on Financial Instruments, an ASU that requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial instruments, including trade receivables, based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. ASU 2016-13 requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. As a result of the Exchange Transaction, the Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-13 as of the date of the Exchange Transaction, or May 1, 2023, in order to conform with Steel Holdings' accounting policies. The adoption did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company did not identify any other accounting standards that would require early adoption in order to conform to Steel Holdings' accounting policies.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance. The ASU requires annual disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. This guidance is effective for all entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021 and early adoption is permitted. The new guidance was effective for the Company's fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 (Fiscal Year 2023). The adoption of this new guidance did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nAccounting Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). The amendment in this update simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models available for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. This update also amends the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions and requires the application of the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per share. The update also requires entities to provide expanded disclosures about the terms and features of convertible instruments, how the instruments have been reported in the entity's financial statements and information about events, conditions and circumstances that can affect how to assess the amount or timing of an entity's future cash flows related to those instruments. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning in our fiscal year ending July 31, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial statements.\nOther new pronouncements issued but not effective until after July 31, 2023 are not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nSubsequent Events\nThe Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of financial statements to provide additional evidence relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, the Company evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and disclosure through the date these financial statements were filed.\n(3)EXCHANGE TRANSACTION\nSteel Partners and Steel Connect Exchange Transaction\nOn April 30, 2023, the Company and Steel Holdings executed a series of agreements, in which Steel Holdings and the Steel Partners Group transferred an aggregate of 3.6 million shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (\"Aerojet\") held by the Steel Partners Group to the Company in exchange for 3.5 million shares of newly created Series E Convertible Preferred Stock of Steel Connect (the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock and such transfer and related transactions, the \"Exchange Transaction\"). Following approval by the Company's stockholders pursuant to the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC at a special meeting of stockholders held on June 6, 2023, the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into an aggregate of 19.8 million shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the common stock or Common Stock), and votes together with the Company's common stock and participates in any dividends paid on the Company's common stock, in each case on an as-converted basis. Upon conversion of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, the Steel Partners Group would hold approximately 84.0% of the outstanding equity interests of the Company, and the Company became a consolidated subsidiary of Steel Holdings for financial statement purposes. The Company is not consolidated by Steel Holdings for Federal income tax purposes because Steel Holdings' ownership in the Company is dispersed between different federal tax consolidation groups. The Exchange Transaction closed on May 1, 2023, the date that the consideration was exchanged between the Company and Steel Holdings. The Company's assets and liabilities have been included in Steel Holdings' consolidated balance sheet as of May 1, 2023, with a related noncontrolling interest of 16.0% of the Company's common stock. Prior to May 1, 2023, Steel Holdings held a 49.6% ownership interest in the Company and accounted for its investment in the Company in accordance with the equity method of accounting. Steel Holdings remeasured the previously held equity method investment to its fair value based upon a valuation of the Company, as of the date of the Exchange Transaction. The Exchange Transaction accomplishes Steel Holdings' objective, which is to increase ownership in the Company in order to benefit from future earnings and growth and strengthens the Company's balance sheet to permit it to do acquisitions.\nThe Exchange Transaction was accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, Business Combinations, and, accordingly, the Company's results of operations were consolidated in Steel Holdings' financial statements on the date of the Exchange Transaction. Steel Holdings recorded a preliminary allocation of the Exchange Transaction to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of May 1, 2023. The final Exchange\nTransaction allocation, which is expected to be completed by December 31, 2023, will be based on final appraisals and other analysis of fair values of acquired assets and liabilities. Steel Holdings does not expect that differences between the preliminary and final Exchange Transaction allocation will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position. As discussed in Note 1 - \"Nature of Operations, the Company elected pushdown accounting in which it uses Steel Holdings' basis of accounting, which reflects the fair market value of the Companys assets and liabilities at the date of the Exchange Transaction.\nThe following table summarizes the total Exchange Transaction consideration:\n(in thousands) May 1, 2023\nFair value of Aerojet common stock $ 202,733\nFair value of Steel Holdings' previously held interests in Steel Connect and Steel Holdings' noncontrolling interest 111,816\nLess: cash acquired from Steel Connect (65,896)\nTotal estimated consideration, less cash acquired $ 248,653\nThe following represents the preliminary calculation of goodwill and fair value amounts recognized:\n(in thousands) May 1, 2023\nAssets\nAccounts receivable, trade $ 36,900\nInventories, net 6,900\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 4,957\nOther intangible assets 35,500\nOther assets 3,900\nProperty and equipment, net 3,400\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 29,250\nInvestments 202,733\nEstimated fair value of total assets acquired by Steel Holdings 323,540\nLiabilities\nAccounts payable 26,300\nAccrued expenses 29,100\nCurrent lease obligations 7,994\nOther current liabilities 7,236\nLong-term lease obligations 21,300\nOther long-term liabilities 5,742\nEstimated fair value of total liabilities assumed by Steel Holdings 97,672\nFair value of identifiable net assets 225,868\nGoodwill attributable to Steel Connect $ 22,785\nThe following table summarizes the significant adjustments recognized by the Company as of the Exchange date for each major class of assets and liabilities as a result of pushdown accounting:\nExchange Date Carrying Value Adjustments Exchange Date Fair Value\n(in thousands)\nGoodwill $ - 22,785 $ 22,785\nOther intangible assets $ - 35,500 $ 35,500\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 28,900 350 $ 29,250\nPrepaid and other current assets $ 5,000 (43) $ 4,957\nConvertible note payable $ (11,586) (1,420) $ (13,006)\nOther current liabilities $ (16,671) 9,435 $ (7,236)\nOther long-term liabilities $ (5,500) (242) $ (5,742)\nAs part of pushdown accounting, the Company calculated the amount of goodwill recognized based on the excess of the Exchange Transaction consideration over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies and the assembled workforce of the Company. The goodwill recognized will not be deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe recorded identifiable intangible assets at their estimated fair value as of the date of the Exchange Transaction. The fair value of the trade name asset was determined using the relief-from-royalty method and the fair value of the customer relationships asset was determined using the excess earnings method. These income-based approaches included assumptions such as the amount and timing of projected cash flows, growth rates, customer attrition rates, discount rates, and the assessment of the assets life cycle. The estimated fair value and estimated remaining useful lives of identifiable intangible assets as of the Exchange Transaction date were as follows:\n(in thousands) Useful Life (Years) Amount\nCustomer relationships 7 $ 25,000\nTrade name Indefinite 10,500\nEstimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets $ 35,500\nThe Company recorded a $0.4 million favorable adjustment to operating lease right-of-use assets for the favorable leasehold interest asset identified as part of purchase accounting. The fair value of the favorable leasehold interest asset was determined by analyzing any favorable or unfavorable leasehold interest inherent in the lease contracts, and comparing the annual lease contract rent over the remaining contractual term to a market rental rate cash flow stream in applying the income approach to estimate any favorable or unfavorable leasehold interest. The difference between the contractual and market-based cash flows was then discounted to present value to estimate the fair value of the favorable leasehold interest asset.\nThe Company wrote off the remaining $43.4 thousand related to deferred financing costs for the Umpqua Revolver in other current assets as part of pushdown accounting.\nThe carrying value of the SPHG Note was increased by $1.4 million to reflect its fair value at the Exchange Date. The value of the SPHG Note was calculated using the Goldman Sachs Binomial Lattice Model.\nOther current liabilities was decreased by $9.4 million related to the accrued pricing liability. The accrued pricing liability was reduced to zero to reflect its fair value at the Exchange Date. Refer to Note 9 - \"Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\" for further information.\nOther non-current liabilities was increased by net $0.2 million. The Company booked $0.8 million deferred tax liability related to the ModusLink trade name intangible. This was partially offset by $0.5 million decrease to the non-current pension liability as a result of the fair value measurement of the Company's defined benefit plans as of the Exchange Date.\nThe Company recorded $202.7 million to investments, which represents the fair value of the Aerojet common stock transferred to Steel Connect as part of the Exchange Transaction. As of July 31, 2023, the Company had disposed of all its interest in Aerojet common stock. The majority of Aerojet common stock was purchased when L3 Harris closed its merger with Aerojet. The Company received total net proceeds of $207.8 million in exchange for all of its Aerojet shares, and recorded a gain of $5.1 million to Other gains, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the Successor Period. See Note 16 - \"Other gains, net\"\nfor more information. As of July 31, 2023, the Company had a receivable of $154.5 million for proceeds receivable, which is recorded as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets within the consolidated balance sheets and was received in August 2023.\n(4)DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nAs discussed in Note 1 - \"Nature of Operations\", on February 25, 2022, the Company completed the disposition of IWCO Direct. The Company received no cash consideration for the disposition (the entire transaction being referred to as the IWCO Direct Disposal). As of the Disposal Date and subject to the terms and conditions of the Transaction Agreement, the parties entered into certain mutual releases as fully set forth in the Transaction Agreement. In addition, as part of the overall transaction, the Buyer issued a note in the principal amount of $6.9 million payable to the Company as consideration for intercompany obligations owed by IWCO Direct to the Company (the Subordinated Note). The Subordinated Note is subordinated to the obligations under the Financing Agreement (including any amendments or other modifications thereto) and matures on the date that is the earlier of (a) the later of (i) August 25, 2027 and (ii) the date that is six months after the maturity of the Financing Agreement, or (b) the date that is six months after repayment in full of the obligations under the Financing Agreement. Due to the subordinated nature of the Subordinated Note and the assessment of collectability, the Company determined the fair value of the Subordinated Note was zero.\nThe Company deconsolidated IWCO Direct as of the Disposal Date as the Company no longer held a controlling financial interest in IWCO Direct as of that date. The Company did not have any amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with IWCO Direct at the time of deconsolidation. The disposal of IWCO Direct represents a strategic shift to exit the direct marketing business and its results are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nA summary of the results of the discontinued operations is as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended July 31,\nNet revenue $ 165,542\nCost of revenue 156,697\nGross profit 8,845\nOperating expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative 30,744\nAmortization of intangible assets(a)\n9,303\nTotal operating expenses 40,047\nOperating loss (31,202)\nOther income (expense):\nGain upon deconsolidation of IWCO Direct 35,457\nInterest expense (16,111)\nTotal other income (expense), net 19,346\nLoss from discontinued operations before income taxes (11,856)\nIncome tax benefit 10,144\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (1,712)\n(a) During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, the Company recorded $9.3 million of amortization expense for the former Direct Marketing reporting unit.\n(5)PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets, net consisted of the following:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\n(In thousands)\nAerojet common stock proceeds receivable $ 154,500 $ -\nPrepaid expenses 2,217 2,085\nOther current assets 1,969 1,466\n$ 158,686 $ 3,551\nAs discussed in Note 3 - \"Exchange Transaction\", the Company recorded $202.7 million to investments, which represents the fair value of the Aerojet common stock transferred to Steel Connect as part of the Exchange Transaction. Prior to July 31, 2023, the Company disposed of all its holdings in Aerojet common stock for a total of $207.8 million. The majority of Aerojet common stock were purchased when L3 Harris closed its merger with Aerojet. As of July 31, 2023, the Company had a receivable of $154.5 million for unsettled proceeds from the disposition of the Aerojet shares. The proceeds were received in August 2023.\n(6)INVENTORIES\nInventories, net consisted of the following:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\n(In thousands)\nRaw materials $ 4,805 $ 7,330\nWork-in-process 239 124\nFinished goods 3,525 697\n$ 8,569 $ 8,151\n(7)GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET\nIn connection with the application of pushdown accounting, the Company recorded intangible assets for goodwill, customer relationships and tradenames. There were no indicators of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during the Successor period. A reconciliation of the change in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment is as follows:\nSupply Chain\nBalance at May 1, 2023 (Successor)\nApplication of pushdown accounting(a)\n$ 22,785\nBalance at July 31, 2023 (Successor)\nGross goodwill 22,785\nAccumulated impairments -\nNet goodwill $ 22,785\n(a) Related to the Exchange Transaction with Steel Holdings.

Customer relationships are amortized on a straight-line basis. Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $0.9 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. The Exchange Transaction closed on May 1, 2023, and as such, there was no intangible assets or related amortization expense for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022.\nBased on gross carrying amounts at July 31, 2023, the Company's estimate of amortization expense for each of the five succeeding years and thereafter is as follows:\nFiscal Year Ending July 31,\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter\nEstimated amortization expense $ 3,555 $ 3,571 $ 3,571 $ 3,571 $ 3,571 $ 6,250\n(8)PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment at cost, consists of the following:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\n(In thousands)\nMachinery and equipment 1,388 12,632\nLeasehold improvements 606 9,994\nSoftware 1,133 34,161\nComputer hardware 400 5,317\nOther 627 2,475\n4,154 64,579\nLess: accumulated depreciation and amortization (456) (61,045)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 3,698 $ 3,534\nAs part of pushdown accounting, the accumulated depreciation of property and equipment balances were eliminated to establish the new cost basis in the Companys property and equipment as of May 1, 2023.\n(9)ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES\nThe following tables reflect the components of \"Accrued expenses\" and \"Other current liabilities\":\nSuccessor Predecessor\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\nAccrued Expenses (In thousands)\nAccrued compensation $ 6,891 $ 5,099\nAccrued audit, tax and legal 5,696 4,564\nAccrued taxes 2,811 3,344\nAccrued price concessions 2,981 4,549\nAccrued occupancy costs 1,412 1,671\nAccrued IT costs 831 1,108\nAccrued other 6,152 8,061\nTotal accrued expenses $ 26,774 $ 28,396\nSuccessor Predecessor\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\nOther Current Liabilities (In thousands)\nAccrued pricing liabilities $ - $ 9,435\nDeferred revenue - current 2,574 2,705\nOther 1,970 1,342\nTotal other current liabilities $ 4,544 $ 13,482\nAs of July 31, 2022, the Company had accrued pricing liabilities of approximately $9.4 million. As previously reported by the Company, several principal adjustments were made to its historic financial statements for periods ended on or before January 31, 2012, the most significant of which related to the treatment of vendor rebates in its pricing policies. Where the retention of a rebate or a mark-up was determined to have been inconsistent with a client contract, the Company concluded that these amounts were not properly recorded as revenue. Accordingly, revenue was reduced by an equivalent amount for the period that the rebate was estimated to have been affected. A corresponding liability for the same amount was recorded in that period (referred to as accrued pricing liabilities).\nThe Companys historical practice has been to derecognize the accrued pricing liabilities by customer depending upon which state the customer or former customer is located in and that states applicable statutes of limitations and escheatment laws. The amounts previously derecognized were recorded in Other gains, net in the Companys consolidated statements of operations.\nIn connection with the Exchange Transaction discussed in Note 1 - \"Nature of Operations\", Steel Holdings recognized the Company's assets and liabilities acquired at fair value in accordance with ASC 805. As of the acquisition date, Steel Holdings determined the fair value of the accrued pricing liability to be zero as Steel Holdings believes it is remote there would be any potential payments to the Company's customers or former customers for the rebates. As such, as of July 31, 2023, the balance of accrued pricing liabilities was reduced to zero with a corresponding offset to goodwill recognized in connection with pushdown accounting.\n(10)DEBT\nThe components of debt and a reconciliation to the carrying amount of long-term debt is presented in the table below:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\n(In thousands)\nUnsecured\n7.50% Convertible Senior Note due September 1, 2024\n$ 12,461 $ 14,940\nCredit Facilities\nUmpqua Revolver - -\nLess: unamortized discounts and issuance costs(a)(b)\n- (3,972)\nTotal debt, net $ 12,461 $ 10,968\n(a) As of May 1, 2023, the Company will account for the SPHG Note under the fair value option.\n(b) Amounts include deferred debt issuance costs related to credit facilities of $79 thousand as of July 31, 2022, which are presented in Other Assets.\n7.50% Convertible Senior Note\nOn February 28, 2019, the Company entered into a 7.50% Convertible Senior Note Due 2024 Purchase Agreement (the \"SPHG Note Purchase Agreement\") with SPH Group Holdings LLC (\"SPHG Holdings\"), whereby SPHG Holdings agreed to loan the Company $14.9 million in exchange for a 7.50% Convertible Senior Note due 2024 (the \"SPHG Note\").\nOn March 9, 2023 (the \"Amendment Date\"), the Company and SPHG Holdings entered into an amendment to the SPHG Note (the SPHG Note Amendment). Pursuant to the SPHG Note Amendment, the maturity date of the SPHG Note was extended six months from March 1, 2024 to September 1, 2024. In addition, the Company repaid $1.0 million in principal amount of the SPHG Note on the Amendment Date, and repaid an additional $1.0 million principal amount of the note on June 9, 2023. In connection with the SPHG Note Amendment, the Company paid SPHG Holdings a cash amendment fee of $0.1 million, and derecognized $0.2 million of the debt discount in proportion to the reduction of the principal balance in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. No other changes were made to the terms of the SPHG Note besides the items discussed.\nSPHG Holdings has the right, at its option, prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of the SPHG Note, to convert the SPHG Note or a portion thereof that is $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, into shares of common stock (if the Company has not received a required stockholder approval) or cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, as applicable (if the Company has received a required stockholder approval), at an initial conversion rate of 45.1356 shares of common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $22.16 per share (subject to adjustment as provided in the SPHG Note) per $1,000 principal amount of the SPHG Note, subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the SPHG Note. As of July 31, 2023, the if-converted value of the SPHG Note did not exceed the principal value of the SPHG Note.\nThe below discusses the components of the SPHG Note as of July 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022:\nOn May 1, 2023, as a result of pushdown accounting related to the Exchange Transaction, the carrying value of the SPHG Note was remeasured to $13.0 million, which represents its fair value. As of May 1, 2023, the Company will now account for the SPHG Note under the fair value option in order to conform with Steel Holdings' basis of accounting, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Refer to Note 3 - \"Exchange Transaction\" and Note 23 - \"Fair Value Measurements\" for further information.\nAs of July 31, 2023, the principal amount of the SPHG note was $12.9 million. The fair value of the SPHG note was $12.5 million.\nAs of July 31, 2022, the principal amount of the SPHG note was $14.9 million and the net carrying value of the SPHG note was $11.0 million. As of July 31, 2022, the effective interest rate on the SPHG Note, including accretion of the discount, was 27.8%, which was the effective interest rate prior to the SPHG Note Amendment. The effective interest rate subsequent to the SPHG Note Amendment was 23.0%.\nPredecessor\nJuly 31, 2022\nCarrying amount of equity component $ 8,200\nPrincipal amount of note $ 14,940\nUnamortized debt discount (3,893)\nNet carrying amount $ 11,047\nBelow is a reconciliation of interest expense related to the SPHG Note to total interest expense:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nMay 1 to July 31, August 1, 2022 to April 30, Fiscal Year Ended July 31,\n2023 2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nInterest expense related to contractual interest coupon on the SPHG Note $ 261 $ 844 $ 1,136\nInterest expense related to accretion of the discount on the SPHG Note - 1,688 1,704\nInterest expense related to revolving credit facilities (see below) - 36 212\nOther 4 20 68\nTotal interest expense $ 265 $ 2,588 $ 3,120\nUmpqua Revolver\nOn March 16, 2022, ModusLink, as borrower, entered into a new credit agreement with Umpqua Bank as lender and as agent. The Umpqua Revolver provides for a maximum credit commitment of $12.5 million and a sublimit of $5.0 million for letters of credit and expires on March 31, 2025. Concurrent with signing the Umpqua Revolver ModusLink submitted a notice of termination to MidCap Financial Trust for its $12.5 million revolving credit facility (the MidCap Credit Facility), which was set to expire on December 31, 2022. There was no balance outstanding on the Midcap Credit Facility at the time of its termination.\nOn March 13, 2023, ModusLink and Umpqua Bank entered into an amendment to the Umpqua Revolver (the \"Umpqua Revolver Amendment\") to extend the expiration date of the facility from March 16, 2024 to March 31, 2025. There were no fees associated with the extension. As of April 30, 2023, there were $43.4 thousand of unamortized debt issuance costs recorded to other current assets, which were written off with the application of pushdown accounting. Refer to Note 3 - \"Exchange Transaction\" for further details.\nAs of July 31, 2023, ModusLink was in compliance with the Umpqua Revolver's covenants, and believes it will remain in compliance with the Umpqua Revolvers covenants for the next twelve months. As of July 31, 2023, ModusLink had available borrowing capacity of $11.9 million and there was $0.6 million outstanding for letters of credit.\n(11)LEASES\nThe Company has operating and finance leases for office space, office equipment, warehouse space and automobiles. The leases have remaining terms of up to six years, some of which include options to purchase, extend or terminate the leases, and management has assessed such terms when determining the lease term for accounting purposes. The Company's current lease arrangements expire through fiscal year 2029.\nThe Company's leases do not include any residual value guarantees, and therefore none were considered in the calculation of the operating ROU and operating lease liability balances. The Company has leases that contain variable payments, most commonly in the form of common area maintenance charges, which are based on actual costs incurred. These variable payments were excluded from the calculation of the operating ROU asset and operating lease liability balances since they are not fixed or in-substance fixed payments.\nFor leases with terms greater than 12 months, the Company records the related operating ROU assets and operating lease liabilities at the present value of lease payments over the lease terms. For leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (with purchase options or extension options that are not reasonably certain to be exercised), the Company does not record them on the balance sheet, but instead recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases.\nLease Expense\nThe components of the Company's lease expense are presented below:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nMay 1 to July 31, August 1, 2022 to April 30, Fiscal Year Ended July 31,\n2023 2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nOperating lease cost $ 2,565 $ 7,538 $ 9,973\nShort-term lease expense 444 1,269 1,488\nSublease income (171) (786) (748)\nVariable lease cost - 7 24\nInterest on finance lease liabilities - - 3\n$ 2,838 $ 8,028 $ 10,740\nLease Commitments\nThe Company's future minimum lease payments required under operating leases that have commenced as of July 31, 2023 were as follows:\nOperating Leases\n(In thousands)\n2024 $ 9,256\n2025 8,054\n2026 5,630\n2027 4,298\n2028 2,088\nThereafter 544\nTotal lease payments 29,870\nLess: imputed interest 2,736\nPresent value of lease payments 27,134\nLess: current lease obligations 7,973\nLong-term lease obligations $ 19,161\nIn order to calculate the operating ROU asset and operating lease liability for a lease, a lessee is required to apply a discount rate equal to the rate implicit in the lease whenever that rate is readily determinable. The Company's lease agreements generally do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate, nor is the rate available to the Company from its lessors and, therefore, the Company determines an incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate represents the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar lease term to obtain an asset of similar value.\nAdditional Lease Information\nAdditional information related to the Company's leases as of July 31, 2023 was as follows:\nWeighted average remaining lease term:\nOperating leases 3.7 years\nWeighted average discount rate:\nOperating leases 5.2%\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information\nSupplemental cash flow information related to the cash paid for amounts included in measurement of lease liabilities during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nMay 1 to July 31, August 1, 2022 to April 30, Fiscal Year Ended July 31,\n2023 2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 2,494 $ 7,224 $ 9,653\nOperating cash flows from finance leases $ - $ - $ 3\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases $ - $ 38 $ 73\n(12)RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES\nModusLink Restructuring Activities\nDuring the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, ModusLink implemented a strategic plan to reorganize its sales function and the e-Business operations. The restructuring charges associated with this plan were primarily composed of employee termination costs. In November 2021, ModusLink amended its strategic plan to include reorganizing its supply chain operations and recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $0.9 million during the three months ended January 31, 2022. In July 2022, ModusLink reorganized its supply chain operations in Ireland and recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $0.6 million during the three months ended July 31, 2022. The restructuring charges recorded in fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 were primarily composed of employee termination costs.\nIn February 2023, ModusLink reorganized its call center operations in the United States and recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $0.1 million during the three months ended April 30, 2023. The restructuring charges recorded in three months ended April 30, 2023 were primarily composed of employee termination costs. In the three months ended July 2023, ModusLink completed its Ireland and United States strategic reorganization plan and reversed approximately $0.1 million of restructuring accrual. The reversal of unused restructuring charges recorded in the three months ended July 31, 2023 were primarily related to employee termination costs.\nThe table below summarizes restructuring charges in the statements of operations for employee termination costs:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nMay 1 to July 31, August 1, 2022 to April 30, Fiscal Year Ended July 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2023 2022\nCost of revenue (62) 97 $ 1,200\nSelling, general and administrative - - 313\n(62) 97 $ 1,513\nChanges to the restructuring liability during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 were as follows:\n(in thousands)\nBalance as of July 31, 2022 $ 892\nCosts incurred 35\nCash payments (925)\nChange in estimates (2)\nBalance as of July 31, 2023 $ -\n(13)COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nDonald Reith v. Warren G. Lichtenstein, et al.\nOn April 13, 2018, a purported shareholder, Donald Reith, filed a verified complaint, Reith v. Lichtenstein, et al., 2018-277 (Del. Ch.) in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the Reith litigation). The complaint alleges class and derivative claims for breach of fiduciary duty and/or aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment against the Board of Directors, Warren G. Lichtenstein, Glen M. Kassan, William T. Fejes, Jack L. Howard, Jeffrey J. Fenton, Philip E. Lengyel and Jeffrey S. Wald; and stockholders Steel Holdings, Steel Partners, Ltd., SPHG Holdings, Handy & Harman Ltd. and WHX CS Corp. (collectively, the \"Steel Parties\") in connection with the acquisition of $35.0 million of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock by SPHG Holdings and equity grants made to Messrs. Lichtenstein, Howard and Fejes on December 15, 2017 (collectively, the \"Challenged Transactions\"). The Company is named as a nominal defendant. The complaint alleges that although the Challenged Transactions were approved by a Special Committee consisting of the independent members of the Board of Directors (Messrs. Fenton, Lengyel and Wald), the Steel Parties dominated and controlled the Special Committee, who approved the Challenged Transactions in breach of their fiduciary duty. Plaintiff alleges that the Challenged Transactions unfairly diluted stockholders and therefore unjustly enriched Steel Holdings, SPHG Holdings and Messrs. Lichtenstein, Howard and Fejes. The complaint also alleges that the Board of Directors made misleading disclosures in the Company's proxy statement for the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in connection with seeking approval to amend the 2010 Incentive Award Plan to authorize the issuance of additional shares to accommodate certain shares underlying the equity grants. Remedies requested include rescission of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and equity grants, disgorgement of any unjustly obtained property or compensation and monetary damages. On June 8, 2018, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to plead demand futility and failure to state a claim. On June 28, 2019, the Court denied most of the motion to dismiss allowing the matter to proceed. The defendants answered the complaint on September 6, 2019, denying all liability.\nOn August 13, 2021, the Company, together with certain of its current and former directors of the Board, Warren Lichtenstein, Glen Kassan, William Fejes, Jr., Jack Howard, Jeffrey Fenton and Jeffrey Wald, as well as other named defendants (collectively, the Defendants), entered into a memorandum of understanding (the MOU) with Donald Reith (the Plaintiff) in connection with the settlement of the Reith v. Lichtenstein, et al., C.A. No. 2018-0277-MTZ (Del. Ch. 2018) class and derivative action. A definitive Stipulation of Settlement (the Stipulation) incorporating the terms of the MOU was filed with the Court on February 18, 2022. Pursuant to the MOU and Stipulation, and contingent on approval of the terms by the court, the Defendants agreed to cause their directors and officers liability insurance carriers to pay to the Company $2.75 million in cash.\nAdditionally, under the MOU and separate letter agreements between the Company and such individuals (the Surrender Agreements), Messrs. Lichtenstein, Howard and Fejes agreed to surrender to the Company an aggregate 3.3 million shares that they had initially received in December 2017 in consideration for services to the Company. The surrenders and cancellations are in the following amounts: for Mr. Lichtenstein, 1,833,333 vested shares and 300,000 unvested shares; for Mr. Howard, 916,667 vested shares and 150,000 unvested shares; and for Mr. Fejes, 100,000 vested shares. On August 17, 2021, Mr. Lichtenstein and Mr. Howard surrendered the shares required under the MOU, the Stipulation and their respective Surrender Agreements, and in December 2021 Mr. Fejes did the same. All such shares were subsequently cancelled. Pursuant to the MOU and Stipulation, the Company also agreed to pay the Plaintiffs counsel legal fees for this matter in an amount up to $2.05 million, if approved by the court.\nAfter the parties filed papers in support of court approval of the settlement, and an objector filed papers in opposition to approval of the settlement, and after hearings held on August 12 and August 18, 2022, the parties submitted an amendment to the Stipulation: (i) increasing the proposed total contribution of the insurers to $3.0 million, (ii) reducing Plaintiffs counsels fee request to $1.6 million, and (iii) providing that if the then pending proposed Merger was consummated, the $3.0 million, minus fees awarded to Plaintiffs counsel and costs of distribution of up to $125,000, would be distributed to the holders of eligible shares of Common Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement governing the Merger), other than the Defendants;\nprovided, however, that no distribution would be required to be made to any holder whose proportionate share of the distribution would be less than $1.00. On September 23, 2022, the court ruled that it was denying approval of the settlement. On September 12, 2023, the court approved a stipulated pretrial and trial schedule culminating in a trial scheduled for September 2024. The possible liability, if any, with respect to this dispute cannot be determined.\nOn June 6, 2023, the Company received a books and records demand from Reith under Delaware General Corporation Law Section 220 which requests an array of documents for the purported purposes of investigating potential wrongdoing in connection with the April 30, 2023 transaction between Steel Holdings and Steel Connect. The Company is responding to this demand. The possible liability, if any, with respect to this dispute cannot be determined.\nMohammad Ladjevardian v. Warren G. Lichtenstein, et al.\nOn September 1, 2023, a purported stockholder, Mohammad Ladjevardian, filed a verified complaint alleging a single direct claim for breach of fiduciary duty against members of Steel Connects Board of Directors, Steel Holdings, Steel Excel, Inc., and WebFinancial Corporation in connection with the Exchange Transaction. Directors named in the complaint are Warren Lichtenstein, Glen Kassan, and Jack Howard. The complaint alleges that although the challenged transaction was approved by the independent Strategic Planning Committee, the committee failed to obtain a control premium or to consider the dilutive effect that the Series E issuance had on the plaintiffs holdings. Remedies requested include rescission of the Series E shares and a judicially imposed requirement that all future transactions involving Steel Holdings and its affiliates be subject to minority stockholder approval. On September 27, 2023, the entity defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. On October 5, 2023, the individual defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. The possible liability, if any, with respect to this dispute cannot be determined as of this date.\n(14)DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS\nThe Company sponsors two defined benefit pension plans covering certain of ModusLink's employees in its Netherlands facility and one unfunded defined benefit pension plan covering certain of its employees in Japan. Pension costs are actuarially determined. During the year ended July 31, 2020, the Netherlands defined benefit plan was amended so active participants no longer accrued benefits as of January 1, 2020 which resulted in a pre-tax curtailment gain of $2.4 million recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nThe plan assets of the two defined benefit plans associated with the ModusLink's Netherlands facility consist of an insurance contract that guarantees the payment of the funded pension entitlements. Insurance contract assets are recorded at fair value, which is determined based on the cash surrender value of the insured benefits which is the present value of the guaranteed funded benefits. Insurance contracts are valued using unobservable inputs, primarily by discounting expected future cash flows relating to benefits paid from a notional investment portfolio in order to determine the cash surrender value of the policy. The following table presents the plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, classified by fair value hierarchy:\nSuccessor Fair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\n(In thousands) July 31, 2023 Asset\nAllocations Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nInsurance contract $ 14,926 97 % $ - $ - $ 14,926\nOther investments 388 3 % - - 388\n$ 15,314 100 % $ - $ - $ 15,314\nPredecessor Fair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\n(In thousands) July 31, 2022 Asset\nAllocations Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nInsurance contract $ 17,560 98 % $ - $ - $ 17,560\nOther investments 416 2 % - - 416\n$ 17,976 100 % $ - $ - $ 17,976\nThe following table summarizes the changes in benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status for these plans:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\n(In thousands)\nChange in benefit obligation\nBenefit obligation at beginning of year $ 21,103 $ 33,584\nAdjustment related to unconditional indexation of benefits 1,077 -\nService cost 10 11\nInterest cost 679 462\nActuarial gain (4,885) (8,674)\nBenefits and administrative expenses paid (275) (227)\nSettlements (109) -\nCurrency translation 1,519 (4,053)\nBenefit obligation at end of year $ 19,119 $ 21,103\nChange in plan assets\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 17,976 $ 29,223\nActual return on plan assets (3,759) (7,544)\nEmployer contributions, net 225 5\nSettlements (108) -\nBenefits and administrative expenses paid (275) (227)\nCurrency translation 1,255 (3,481)\nFair value of plan assets at end of year $ 15,314 $ 17,976\nFunded status\nCurrent liabilities $ (9) $ (11)\nNoncurrent liabilities (3,796) (3,116)\nNet amounts recognized on the consolidated balance sheets $ (3,805) $ (3,127)\nAs discussed above, during the year ended July 31, 2020, a Netherlands defined benefit pension plan was amended such that active participants no longer accrued benefits as of January 1, 2020. At that time, the active plan participants were moved into a new defined benefit contribution pension plan. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, the Company recorded an increase of approximately $1.1 million to accrued pension liabilities for the defined benefit pension plan as it was determined that plan participants are entitled to unconditional indexation of benefits for as long as they remain in active service with the Company.\nAdditionally, as discussed in Note 3 - \"Exchange Transaction\", the defined benefit pension plan assets were remeasured at fair value as of the date of the Exchange Transaction, which resulted in a $0.5 million decrease to the pension liability, with the offset to goodwill. The incremental decrease of $36.2 thousand to the pension liability was booked to accumulated other comprehensive income in July 2023 based off of the fair value of the defined benefit pension plan assets as of July 31, 2023.\nInformation for pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets was as follows:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\n(In thousands)\nProjected benefit obligation $ 19,119 $ 21,103\nAccumulated benefit obligation $ 19,119 $ 21,103\nFair value of plan assets $ 15,314 $ 17,976\nThe following table summarizes the components of net periodic pension cost:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\n(In thousands)\nService cost $ 10 $ 11\nInterest costs 679 462\nExpected return on plan assets (574) (407)\nAmortization of net actuarial loss 9 4\nNet periodic pension costs $ 124 $ 70\nAssumptions\nThe table below summarizes the weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\nDiscount rate 4.21 % 2.96 %\nRate of compensation increase - % - %\nThe table below summarizes weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic pension cost:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\nDiscount rate 3.91 % 2.58 %\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets 3.88 % 2.51 %\nRate of compensation increase - % - %\nThe discount rate reflects the Company's best estimate of the interest rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled as of the valuation date. It is based on the Mercer Yield Curve for the Eurozone as of July 31, 2023 for the appropriate duration of the plan.\nTo develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions, consideration is given to the current level of expected returns on risk free investments, the historical level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for the future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.\nBenefit Payments\nThe following table summarizes expected benefit payments from the plans through fiscal year 2032. Actual benefit payments may differ from expected benefit payments. The minimum employer required contributions to the plans are expected to be approximately $0.6 million in fiscal year 2024.\nPension Benefit\nPayments\n(In thousands)\nFor the fiscal year ending July 31:\n2024 $ 340\n2025 372\n2026 463\n2027 444\n2028 509\nThereafter 3,451\nThe current target allocations for plan assets are primarily insurance contracts.\nValuation Technique\nBenefit obligations are computed using the projected unit credit method.

See Note 3 - \"Exchange Transaction\" for more information. Other gains, net for the August 1, 2022 to April 30, 2023 Predecessor Period was primarily due to: (1) $1.9 million gain from proceeds received from the sale of an investment in Tallan, Inc., (2) $1.4 million settlement with a client, and (3) $0.9 million interest income.\n(17)SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS\nShare-Based Compensation Plans\nThe Company has adopted share-based compensation plans in order to provide incentives to directors, officers, employees and other individuals providing services to or on behalf of the Company and its subsidiaries. Where applicable, the disclosures below have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse/Forward Stock Split effective June 21, 2023.\nOn June 12, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors adopted, subject to stockholder approval, the Steel Connect, Inc. 2020 Stock Incentive Compensation Plan (\"2020 Incentive Plan\"), and on July 23, 2020, the 2020 Incentive Plan was approved. The 2020 Incentive Plan provides that the Company may grant nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, other stock-based awards and other cash based-awards. The 2020 Incentive Plan replaced the 2010 Incentive Award Plan, as amended (the \"2010 Incentive Plan\"). The Company also has a 2005 Non-Employee Director Plan (the \"2005 Director Plan\"). As of July 23, 2020, no additional grants may be issued under the 2010 Incentive Plan. Any awards that are outstanding under the 2010 Incentive Plan continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of such plan. Under the 2020 Incentive Plan, the Company may grant up to 529,821 shares of common stock of the Company in addition to (i) 393,015 shares of common stock previously available for issuance under the 2010 Incentive Plan and (ii) up to 113,627 shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards under the 2010 Incentive Plan, which if forfeited or lapse unexercised or are settled in cash and are not issued under the prior plan for any reason, may be issued under the 2020 Incentive Plan. As of July 31, 2023, 808,285 shares were available for future issuance under the 2020 Incentive Plan.\nThe Board of Directors administers all stock plans, approves the individuals to whom options will be granted, and determines the number of shares and exercise price of each option and may delegate this authority to a committee of the Board of Directors or to certain officers of the Company in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") regulations and applicable Delaware law.\nDuring the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company awarded stock-based compensation under the 2020 Incentive Plan.\nOn December 15, 2017, under the 2010 Incentive Plan, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee and the Company's Compensation Committee, approved 4.0 million restricted stock grants and 1.5 million market based restricted stock grants to non-employee directors of the Company. The 4.0 million restricted stock vested immediately on the grant date. The 1.5 million market based restricted stock grants do not expire and vest upon the attainment of target stock price hurdles. As of July 31, 2020, 1.0 million of the market based restricted stock grants had met the target stock price hurdles. The restricted stock grants and market based restricted stock grants were fully expensed as of July 31, 2021. As discussed in Note 13 - \"Commitments and Contingencies\", on August 13, 2021 and February 22, 2022, respectively the Company, together with certain of its current and former directors of the Board, entered into a memorandum of understanding and stipulation of settlement with Donald Reith in connection with the settlement of the Reith v. Lichtenstein, et al., C.A. No. 2018-0277-MTZ\n(Del. Ch. 2018) class and derivative action. Under the MOU, the stipulation and separate letter agreements between the Company and recipients of the 5.5 million restricted stock and market based restricted stock awards granted In December 2017, the non-employee directors surrendered to the Company an aggregate 2.9 million vested shares and 0.5 million unvested shares.\nFor the May 1 to July 31, 2023 Successor Period, $0.2 million of share-based compensation expense was recorded in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. For the August 1, 2022 to April 30, 2023 Predecessor Period, and the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 Predecessor Period, $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense was recorded in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRestricted Stock\nRestricted stock consists of shares of common stock that are subject to restrictions on transfer and risk of forfeiture until the fulfillment of specified conditions. Restricted stock is expensed ratably over the term of the restriction period, ranging from one to five years unless there are performance conditions placed on the restricted stock, in which case the restricted stock is expensed using graded vesting. Restricted stock compensation expense for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 was $0.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\nA summary of the activity of the Company's restricted stock for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, is as follows:\nNumber of Shares Weighted Average\nGrant Date Fair\nValue\n(Share amounts in thousands)\nNonvested stock outstanding, July 31, 2022 51 $ 13.95\nGranted 64 10.97\nVested (61) 13.32\nForfeited - -\nNonvested stock outstanding, July 31, 2023 54 $ 10.97\nThe fair value of restricted shares is determined based on the market price of the Company's common stock on the grant date. The total grant date fair value of restricted stock that vested during the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively. As of July 31, 2023, there was approximately $0.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.7 years.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company offers to its employees an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \"ESPP\") under which an aggregate of 64,286 shares of the Company's stock may be issued. Employees who elect to participate in the ESPP instruct the Company to withhold a specified amount through payroll deductions during each quarterly period. On the last business day of each applicable quarterly payment period, the amount withheld is used to purchase the Company's common stock at a purchase price equal to 85% of the lower of the market price on the first or last business day of the quarterly period. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, the Company issued zero shares under the ESPP. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, the Company issued approximately 53 shares under the ESPP. Approximately 8,284 shares are available for future issuance as of July 31, 2023.\n(18)INCOME TAXES\nThe components of income (loss) before provision for income taxes are as follows:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nMay 1 to July 31, August 1, 2022 to April 30, Fiscal Year Ended\nJuly 31,\n2023 2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nIncome (loss) from operations before income taxes:\nU.S. $ 9,866 $ 2,021 $ (5,189)\nForeign (2,115) 7,069 7,321\nTotal income (loss) from operations before income taxes $ 7,751 $ 9,090 $ 2,132\nThe components of income tax expense from operations consist of the following:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nMay 1 to July 31, August 1, 2022 to April 30, Fiscal Year Ended\nJuly 31,\n2023 2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nCurrent (benefit) provision:\nFederal $ 72 $ 487 $ -\nState (110) 48 429\nForeign (110) 1,095 1,918\n(148) 1,630 2,347\nDeferred (benefit) provision:\nFederal - - 8,849\nState - - 76\nForeign (250) - 116\n(250) - 9,041\nTotal tax (benefit) provision $ (398) $ 1,630 $ 11,388\nAs of July 31, 2023, the Company recorded a non-current deferred tax asset of $0.3 and a non-current deferred tax liability of $0.8 million in \"Other Assets\" and \"Other Long-term Liabilities\", respectively. As of July 31, 2022, the Company recorded a non-current deferred tax asset of $0.1 million and a non-current deferred tax liability of $0.1 million in \"Other Assets\" and \"Other Long-term Liabilities,\" respectively. The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\n(In thousands)\nDeferred tax assets:\nAccruals and reserves $ 2,645 $ 4,295\nTax basis in excess of financial basis for intangible and fixed assets 175 901\nLease liability 3,574 2,288\nInterest expense disallowance - 2,357\nCredit carry forwards 25 25\nNet operating loss and capital loss carry forwards 95,832 474,496\nTotal gross deferred tax assets 102,251 484,362\nLess: valuation allowance (90,436) (481,178)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 11,815 $ 3,184\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nFinancial basis in excess of tax basis for intangible and fixed assets $ (8,446) $ (69)\nRight of use asset (3,454) (2,154)\nConvertible debt (404) (917)\nTotal gross deferred tax liabilities (12,304) (3,140)\nNet deferred tax liabilities $ (489) $ 44\nThe net change in the total valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 was an decrease of approximately $390.7 million. This decrease is primarily due to the U.S. valuation allowance. A valuation allowance has been recorded against the gross deferred tax asset in the U.S and certain foreign subsidiaries since management believes that after considering all the available objective evidence, both positive and negative, historical and prospective, it is more likely than not that certain assets will not be realized. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 was an increase of approximately $24.6 million.\nThe Company has certain deferred tax benefits, including those generated by net operating losses and certain other tax attributes (collectively, the \"Tax Benefits\"). The Company's ability to use these Tax Benefits could be substantially limited if it were to experience an \"ownership change,\" as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). In general, an ownership change would occur if there is a greater than 50-percentage point change in ownership of securities by stockholders owning (or deemed to own under Section 382 of the Code) five or more of a corporation's securities over a rolling three year period.\nThe Company determined that the beginning balances related to its deferred tax accounts for both the cumulative net operating loss carryover along with valuation allowance balances needed to be updated due to an immaterial error associated with the return to provision true up. The return to provision true up adjustment related to the calculation of the Companys stock basis for the IWCO worthless stock deduction. The net impact of the reduction to the beginning balances for the net operating losses and valuation allowances was approximately $4.0 million and did not change any amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of operations.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law in the United States. Among other provisions, the IRA includes a 15% corporate minimum tax rate applied to certain large corporations and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. We do not expect the IRA to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOn March 27, 2020, the President of the United States signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act into law which is intended to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy, public health, state and local governments, individuals and businesses. The CARES Act contains numerous tax provisions including temporary changes to the future limitations on interest deductions related to section 163j.\nThe Company has estimated its fiscal year 2023 global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") inclusion based on its current year foreign activity. The foreign entities have minor earnings and profit adjustments that will be factored in as part of the tax return filing. These amounts are not material and will not have a significant impact on the overall tax provision or disclosure. Due to the net operating losses available in the U.S., the Company is not entitled to a Section 250 deduction, which\nis why the total income amount has been recorded as the GILTI inclusion. The Company has made an accounting policy election, as allowed by the SEC and FASB, to recognize the impact of GILTI within the period incurred. Therefore, no U.S. deferred taxes are provided in GILTI inclusions of future foreign subsidiary earnings.\nThe Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately $369.9 million and $138.8 million, respectively, at July 31, 2023. As of July 31, 2023, approximately $1.7 billion of net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes expired. $273.3 million of the company's federal net operating losses will expire from the fiscal year ending July 31, 2024 through the fiscal year ended July 31, 2038 and the remainder federal net operating losses of $96.6 million has an indefinite carryforward period. The state net operating losses will expire from the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 through the fiscal year ended July 31, 2042. The Company has a foreign net operating loss carryforward of approximately $69.8 million, of which $67.2 million has an indefinite carryforward period.\nIncome tax expense attributable to income from continuing operations differs from the expense computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21.0% to (loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes as a result of the following:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nMay 1 to July 31, August 1, 2022 to April 30, Fiscal Year Ended\nJuly 31,\n2023 2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nComputed \"expected\" income tax expense (benefit) $ 1,627 $ 1,909 $ 448\nIncrease (decrease) in income tax expense resulting from:\nChange in valuation allowance (350,469) (424) 21,703\nForeign tax rate differential (255) (50) 56\nNondeductible expenses 459 - 159\nForeign withholding taxes 245 147 134\nForeign other adjustments (246) - 951\nGILTI 1,141 - 4,775\nAddition of uncertain tax position reserves (430) 11 58\nWorthless stock deduction - - (16,860)\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit (1,916) 37 (603)\nExpiration of net operating loss 347,462 - -\nDeferred true-up 1,786 - 751\nOther 198 - (184)\nActual income tax (benefit) expense $ (398) $ 1,630 $ 11,388\nThe calculation of the Company's income tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in several tax jurisdictions. The Company is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, the Company records estimated reserves when necessary. Based on the evaluation of current tax positions, the Company believes it has appropriately accrued for exposures.\nThe Company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within and outside of the United States. At July 31, 2023 and 2022, the total amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, related to federal, state and foreign taxes was approximately $0.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively. To the extent the unrecognized tax benefits are recognized, the entire amount would impact income tax expense. The Company expects that there will be a $0.3 million reduction of the unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months related to the U.S. state income tax exposure as a result of a lapse in the applicable statute of limitations.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S., various states and in foreign jurisdictions. The federal and state income tax returns are generally subject to tax examinations for the tax years ended July 31, 2020 through July 31, 2023. To the extent the Company has tax attribute carryforwards, the tax year in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. In addition, a\nnumber of tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate government agencies for certain countries in the Europe and Asia regions. In Europe, the Company's 2015 through 2022 tax years remain subject to examination in most locations while the Company's 2011 through 2022 tax years remain subject to examination in most Asia locations.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the total amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\n(In thousands)\nBalance as of beginning of year $ 571 $ 2,140\nAdditions for current year tax positions - -\nCurrency translation - (4)\nReductions for lapses in statute of limitations (297) (67)\nReductions for member leaving consolidated group - (1,498)\nBalance as of end of year $ 274 $ 571\nIn accordance with the Company's accounting policy, interest related to income taxes is included in the provision for income taxes line of the consolidated statements of operations. For the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has not recognized any material interest expense related to uncertain tax positions. As of July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had recorded liabilities for increases in interest expense related to uncertain tax positions for an immaterial amount. The Company expects $0.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest will reverse in the next twelve months.\n(19)EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nAs discussed in Note 2 - \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\", the Reverse/Forward Stock Split was effective on June 21, 2023. The Companys shares of outstanding common stock and earnings (loss) per share amounts have been retroactively restated for all periods presented for the Reverse/Forward Stock Split. The following table reconciles net income (loss) per share for the periods below:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nMay 1 to July 31, August 1, 2022 to April 30, Fiscal Year Ended\nJuly 31,\n2023 2023 2022\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nReconciliation of net income (loss) to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders after assumed conversions:\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations $ 8,149 $ 7,460 $ (9,256)\nLoss from discontinued operations - - (1,712)\nNet income (loss) 8,149 7,460 (10,968)\nLess: Preferred dividends on Series C preferred stock (537) (1,593) (2,129)\nNet income (loss) available to common stockholders 7,612 5,867 (13,097)\nLess: Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities (5,803) - -\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ 1,809 $ 5,867 $ (13,097)\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nDividends on Series C preferred stock 537 1,593 -\nUndistributed earnings allocated to Series E preferred stock 5,803 - -\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders - assuming dilution $ 8,149 $ 7,460 $ (13,097)\nNet income (loss) per common share - basic\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations $ 0.29 $ 0.91 $ (1.77)\nNet loss from discontinued operations - - (0.27)\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ 0.29 $ 0.91 $ (2.04)\nNet income (loss) per common share - diluted\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations $ 0.29 $ 0.89 $ (1.77)\nNet loss from discontinued operations - - (0.27)\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ 0.29 $ 0.89 $ (2.04)\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic 6,177 6,449 6,425\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nCommon stock equivalents - Restricted stock and restricted stock shares 60 55 -\nCommon stock equivalents - Series C Preferred Stock 1,913 1,913 -\nCommon stock equivalents - Series E Preferred Stock 19,810 - -\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted 27,960 8,417 6,425\nAs of July 31, 2023, the Company calculates basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share using the two-class method, as the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock issued in the Exchange Transaction meets the definition of a participating security. The two-class method is an allocation formula that determines net income (loss) per common share for each share of common stock and Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, a participating security, according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Under this method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common shares and Series E Convertible Preferred Stock based on their respective rights to receive dividends. The holders of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to participate equally and ratably with the holders of shares of Common Stock in all dividends or other distributions on the shares of Common Stock as if, immediately prior to each record date for payment of dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock, shares of Series E Preferred Stock then outstanding were converted into shares of Common Stock. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) allocated to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Net income (loss) available to common stockholders for the period includes dividends paid to common stockholders during the period plus a proportionate share of undistributed net income (loss) allocable to common stockholders for the period; the proportionate share of undistributed net income allocable to common stockholders for the period is based on the proportionate\nshare of total weighted-average common shares and participating securities outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period, plus potential common shares considered outstanding during the period, as long as the inclusion of such awards is not antidilutive. Potential common shares consist of restricted common stock (calculated based on the treasury stock method) and shares issuable upon debt or preferred stock conversion (calculated using an as-if converted method), using the more dilutive of either the two-class method or as-converted stock method.\nThe Company was not required to apply the two-class method during the Predecessor Period as there were no participating securities, and as such, there were no changes to the Predecessor Period other than the retroactive restatement for the Reverse/Forward Stock Split discussed previously.\nFor the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 Predecessor Period during which the Company recorded a net loss, diluted net loss per share is equal to basic net loss per share because the effect of dilutive securities outstanding is anti-dilutive. The below details certain exclusions from the calculation of diluted net income per share for the May 1 to July 31, 2023 Successor Period and the August 1, 2022 to April 30, 2023 Predecessor Period as their inclusion would have been antidilutive:\nFor the May 1 to July 31, 2023 Successor Period, $0.2 million of interest expense, net of tax impact related to the SPHG Note was excluded from the numerator in the calculation of diluted net income per share as their inclusion would have been antidilutive.\nFor the August 1, 2022 to April 30, 2023 Predecessor Period, $2.3 million of interest expense, net of tax impact related to the SPHG Note were excluded from the numerator in the calculation of diluted net income per share as their inclusion would have been antidilutive.\nFor the May 1 to July 31, 2023 Successor Period, 0.6 million common stock equivalent shares (including those related to the SPHG Note) were excluded from the denominator in the calculation of diluted net income per share as their inclusion would have been antidilutive.\nFor the August 1, 2022 to April 30, 2023 Predecessor Period, 0.6 million common stock equivalent shares (including those related to the SPHG Note) were excluded from the denominator in the calculation of diluted net income per share as their inclusion would have been antidilutive.\n(20)ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) represents the cumulative other comprehensive income (loss) items that are reported separate from net income and detailed on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nAs discussed in Note 1, \"Nature of Operations\", we have elected to apply push-down accounting as of the Exchange Transaction date, May 1, 2023. As part of this election, the Company's accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was reset to zero at the Exchange Transaction date.\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, are as follows:\nForeign\ncurrency\nitems Pension\nitems Total\n(In thousands)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at July 31, 2021 (Predecessor) $ 9,762 $ (2,600) $ 7,162\nForeign currency translation adjustment (3,699) - (3,699)\nPension liability adjustments - 677 677\nNet current-period other comprehensive (loss) income (3,699) 677 (3,022)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at July 31, 2022 (Predecessor) 6,063 (1,923) 4,140\nForeign currency translation adjustment 999 - 999\nPension liability adjustments - (1,078) (1,078)\nNet current-period other comprehensive income (loss) 999 (1,078) (79)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at April 30, 2023 (Predecessor) 7,062 (3,001) 4,061\nApplication of pushdown accounting (7,062) 3,001 (4,061)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at May 1, 2023 (Successor) - - -\nForeign currency translation adjustment (623) - (623)\nPension liability adjustments - 36 36\nNet current-period other comprehensive (loss) income (623) 36 (587)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at July 31, 2023 (Successor) $ (623) $ 36 $ (587)\nIn both the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded an immaterial amount in taxes related to other comprehensive income (loss).\n(21)STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\nThe amount of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of July 31, 2023 and 2022 in the consolidated statements of cash flows is reconciled to the Company's consolidated balance sheets as follows:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\n(In thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 121,372 $ 53,142\nFunds held for clients 2,031 4,903\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 123,403 $ 58,045\nCash used for operating activities reflect cash payments for interest and income taxes as follows:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nMay 1 to July 31, August 1, 2022 to April 30, Fiscal Year Ended\nJuly 31,\n2023 2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nCash paid for interest $ 9 $ 1,145 $ 1,237\nCash paid for income taxes $ 3,008 $ - $ 2,364\nCash paid for taxes can be lower than income tax expense as shown on the Company's consolidated statements of operations due to the timing of required payments in relation to recorded expense, which can cross fiscal years.\nNon-Cash Activities\nNon-cash investing activities during the Successor Period included $154.5 million for unsettled proceeds from the disposition of the Aerojet shares. The proceeds were received in August 2023.\nNon-cash financing activities during the Successor Period included the issuance of $202.7 million of Series E Preferred Stock in exchange for 3.6 million shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of Aerojet held by Steel Holdings in the Exchange Transaction. Additionally, non-cash financing activities during the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 included the issuance of approximately 0.1 million and 0.1 million shares, respectively, of non-vested common stock, valued at approximately $0.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively, to certain employees and non-employees of the Company. The Company also approved $57.4 thousand of accelerated compensation cost related to unvested shares that were approved to vest.\n(22)STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company's Board of Directors has the authority, subject to any limitations prescribed by Delaware law, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix and determine the designation, privileges, preferences and rights and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions of those shares, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights, terms of sinking funds, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series or the designation of the series, without any further vote or action by stockholders. Any shares of the Company's preferred stock so issued may have priority over its common stock with respect to dividend, liquidation and other rights. The Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting rights or conversion features that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of its common stock. Although the issuance of preferred stock could provide us with flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, under some circumstances, it could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control.\nSeries C Preferred Stock\nOn December 15, 2017, the Company entered into a Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") with SPHG Holdings, pursuant to which the Company issued 35,000 shares of the Company's newly created Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \"Series C Convertible Preferred Stock\"), to SPHG Holdings at a price of $1,000 per share, for an aggregate purchase consideration of $35.0 million (the \"Series C Convertible Preferred Stock Transaction\"). The terms, rights, obligations and preferences of the Preferred Stock are set forth in a Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the \"Series C Certificate of Designations\"), which has been filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.\nUnder the Series C Certificate of Designations, each share of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock can be converted into shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \"Common Stock\"), at an initial conversion price equal to $18.29 per share, subject to appropriate adjustments for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction. Holders of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock will also receive dividends at 6% per annum payable, at the Company's option, in cash or Common Stock. If at any time the closing bid price of the Company's Common Stock exceeds 170% of the conversion price for at least five consecutive trading days (subject to appropriate adjustments for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction), the Company has the right to require each holder of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock to convert all, or any whole number, of shares of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock into Common Stock.\nUpon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, either voluntary or involuntary, or the merger or consolidation of the Company or significant subsidiary, or the sale of substantially all of the assets or capital stock of the Company or a significant subsidiary, the holders of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or funds of the Company to the holders of other equity or equity equivalent securities of the Company other than the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share in cash equal to the sum of (i) 100% of the stated value per share of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (initially $1,000 per share) then held by them (as adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or other similar transactions with respect to the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock), plus (ii) 100% of all declared but unpaid dividends, and all accrued but unpaid dividends on each such share of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, in each case as the date of the triggering event.\nOn or after December 15, 2022, each holder of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock can also require the Company to redeem its Series C Convertible Preferred Stock in cash at a price equal to the Liquidation Preference (as defined in Series C Certificate of Designations).\nEach holder of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock has a vote equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which its Series C Convertible Preferred Stock would be convertible as of the record date, provided that the number of shares\nvoted is based upon a conversion price which is no less than the greater of the book or market value of the Common Stock on the closing date of the purchase of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, for so long as the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock remains outstanding, the Company will not, directly or indirectly, and including in each case with respect to any significant subsidiary, without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (i) liquidate, dissolve or wind up the Company or any significant subsidiary; (ii) consummate any transaction that would constitute or result in a Liquidation Event (as defined in the Series C Certificate of Designations); (iii) effect or consummate any Prohibited Issuance (as defined in the Series C Certificate of Designations); or (iv) create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Indebtedness (as defined in the Series C Certificate of Designations) of any kind, other than certain existing Indebtedness of the Company and any replacement financing thereto, unless any such replacement financing is on substantially similar terms as such existing Indebtedness.\nThe Purchase Agreement provides that the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect the piggyback registration of the Common Stock issuable on the conversion of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and any securities issued or issuable upon any stock split, dividend or other distribution, recapitalization or similar event with respect to the foregoing, with the SEC in the manner reasonably requested by the holder and the qualification of the securities in all states reasonably requested by the holder, in each case, in accordance with certain enumerated conditions. The Purchase Agreement also contains other representations, warranties and covenants, customary for an issuance of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock in a private placement of this nature.\nThe Series C Convertible Preferred Stock Transaction was approved and recommended to the Board of Directors by the Special Committee of the Board of Directors consisting of independent directors not affiliated with Steel Holdings GP, which controls the power to vote and dispose of the securities held by SPHG Holdings and its affiliates.\nSeries E Preferred Stock\nOn May 1, 2023, the Company and Steel Holdings executed a series of agreements in which the Steel Partners Group agreed to transfer certain marketable securities held by the Steel Partners Group to Steel Connect in exchange for 3.5 million shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock of Steel Connect (the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, and, such transfer the Transfer and Exchange Agreement). Pursuant to the Transfer and Exchange Agreement, the Company held a special stockholders meeting on June 6, 2023 (the Special Meeting) to consider and vote upon the rights of the Series E Preferred Stock to vote and receive dividends together with the Common Stock on an as-converted basis and the issuance of the Company's common stock (the \"Common Stock\") upon conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock by the holders at their option, pursuant to the rules and regulations of Nasdaq (the Nasdaq Proposal). Following approval of the Nasdaq Proposal by the Steel Connect stockholders (the Stockholder Approval), the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock became convertible into an aggregate of 19.8 million shares of the Common Stock, and votes together with the Common Stock and participates in any dividends paid on the Common Stock, in each case on an as-converted basis. Refer to Note 25 - \"Related Party Transactions\" for more information on the Voting Agreement.\nThe terms, rights, obligations and preferences of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock are set forth in a Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the Series E Certificate of Designations), which are summarized below:\nAny holder of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock (Holder), may, at its option, convert all or any shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock held by such Holder into Common Stock based on a conversion price of $10.27 (the Conversion Price) per share, subject to appropriate adjustments for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, or similar transaction by delivering to the Company a conversion notice.\nHolders are entitled to participate equally and ratably with the holders of shares of Common Stock in all dividends or other distributions on the shares of Common Stock as if, immediately prior to each record date for payment of dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock, shares of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding were converted into shares of Common Stock. Dividends or other distributions payable will be payable on the same date that such dividends or other distributions are payable to holders of shares of Common Stock, and no dividends or other distributions will be payable to holders of shares of Common Stock unless dividends or such other distributions are also paid at the same time in respect of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock.\nUpon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, either voluntary or involuntary, any merger or consolidation in which the Company is a constituent party or a Significant Subsidiary is a constituent party and the Company issues shares of its capital stock pursuant to such merger or consolidation such that the stockholders of the Company prior to such merger or consolidation hold less than 50.0% of the aggregate voting securities of\nthe Corporation following such merger or consolidation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets or capital stock of the Company or a significant subsidiary (collectively, or any of these, a Liquidation Event(s)), the holders of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or funds of the Company to the holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share in cash equal to $58.1087 (as adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination or other similar transactions with respect to the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock Liquidation Preference). In the event that the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock Liquidation Preference is not paid with respect to any shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock as required to be paid, such shares shall continue to be entitled to dividends and all such shares shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided within the Series E Certificate of Designations.\nThe Company nor the Holder have any rights to redeem the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock.\nPrior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock was non-voting and did not have the right to vote on any matters presented to the stockholders of the Company. Following the date on which Stockholder Approval was obtained, which was approved by the Company's stockholders at the special stockholders' meeting held on June 6, 2023, each Holder is now entitled to vote with holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock, voting together as a single class, with respect to any and all matters presented to the stockholders of the Company for their action or consideration (whether at a meeting of stockholders of the Company, by written action of stockholders in lieu of a meeting or otherwise), except as provided by law. In any such vote, each Holder is entitled to a number of votes equal to the largest number of whole shares of Common Stock into which all shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock held of record by such Holder is convertible as of the record date for such vote or written consent or, if there is no specified record date, as of the date of such vote or written consent.\nCommon Stock\nEach holder of the Company's common stock is entitled to:\none vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, subject to the rights of any preferred stock that may be outstanding;\ndividends as may be declared by the Company's Board of Directors out of funds legally available for that purpose, subject to the rights of any preferred stock that may be outstanding; and\na pro rata share in any distribution of the Company's assets after payment or providing for the payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any outstanding preferred stock in the event of liquidation.\nHolders of the Company's common stock have no cumulative voting rights, redemption rights or preemptive rights to purchase or subscribe for any shares of its common stock or other securities. All of the outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of its common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any existing series of preferred stock and any series of preferred stock that the Company may designate and issue in the future. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Company's common stock.\nReverse/Forward Stock Split\nAt the special stockholders meeting held on June 6, 2023, the stockholders approved proposals to amend the Companys restated certificate of incorporation (the Charter), to effect a 1-for-3,500 reverse stock split of the common stock (the Reverse Stock Split), followed immediately by a 375-for-1 forward stock split of the common stock (the Forward Stock Split, and, together with the Reverse Stock Split, the Reverse/Forward Stock Split). On June 7, 2023, the Board approved the Reverse/Forward Stock Split, and as such, the Board directed the Company to file with the State of Delaware certificates of amendment to our Charter to effectuate the Reverse/Forward Stock Split. The Reverse/Forward Stock Split was effective on June 21, 2023 (the Effective Date). The Companys common stock began trading on a Reverse/Forward Stock Split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Capital Market when the market opened on June 22, 2023. The trading symbol for the Companys common stock remains STCN.\nNo fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse/Forward Stock Split. Shares held by stockholders who held fewer than 3,500 of the Companys common stock immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split were converted into the right to receive a payment in cash (without interest) equal to the fair value of such shares as of the time when those entitled to receive such payments were determined, which shall be an amount equal to such number of shares of Companys common stock held multiplied by the average of the closing sales prices of the Companys common stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split, and each share of Companys\ncommon stock held by a stockholder of record owning 3,500 shares or more immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split were converted into a new number of shares of Companys common stock based on a ratio of 375 shares of the Companys common stock for each share of the Companys common stock owned immediately following the Reverse Stock Split, including any fractional shares owned following the Reverse Stock Split; however, with respect to any fractions of a share of Company Common Stock that may be held as a result of the Forward Stock Split, stockholders received a payment in cash (without interest) equal to the fair value of such fractions as of the time when those entitled to receive such fractions are determined, which was an amount equal to such fractions multiplied by the average of the closing sales prices of the Companys common stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the effective date of the Reverse/Forward Stock Split (with such average closing sales prices being adjusted to give effect to the Reverse/Forward Stock Split).\nThe number of shares of authorized Companys common stock did not change as a result of the Reverse/Forward Stock Split; however, the number of shares of outstanding Companys common stock decreased as a result of the Reverse/Forward Stock Split.\nAccordingly, all share and per-share amounts for the current period and prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse/Forward Stock Split.\nThe number of shares of Companys common stock issuable upon the exercise of Series C Preferred Stock and the Series E Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Reverse/Forward Stock Split were proportionately decreased and the conversion price of the Series C Preferred Stock and the Series E Preferred Stock were proportionately increased, effective as of June 21, 2023, the close of business on the date of such Reverse/Forward Stock Split. Our authorized preferred stock was not affected by the reverse stock split and continues to be 3,535,000 shares of preferred stock, with a par value of $0.01 per share. For details of the effects of the Exchange Transaction see Note 3, \"Exchange Transaction\".\n(23)FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following tables present the Company's financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, classified by fair value hierarchy:\nSuccessor Fair Value Measurements at\nReporting Date Using\n(In thousands) July 31, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nMoney market funds $ 31,090 $ 31,090 $ - $ -\nLiabilities:\nSPHG Note $ 12,461 $ - $ - $ 12,461\nPredecessor Fair Value Measurements at\nReporting Date Using\n(In thousands) July 31, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nMoney market funds $ 31,756 $ 31,756 $ - $ -\nThere were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 during any of the periods presented.\nWhen available, quoted prices are used to determine fair value. When quoted prices in active markets are available, investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. When quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair values are determined using pricing models, and the inputs to those pricing models are based on observable market inputs. The inputs to the pricing models are typically benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads and benchmark securities, among others.\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nThe Company reviews the carrying amounts of these assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset\ngroup or reporting unit is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The Company estimates the fair values of assets subject to impairment based on the Company's own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets and on observable market data, when available.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company's financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, customer deposits, accounts payable, restricted cash and debt, and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at carrying value. Carrying value approximates fair value for these items due to their short-term maturities or expected settlement dates of these instruments.\nAs of July 31, 2022, the Company did not measure the fair value of the SPHG Note on a recurring basis, as the assumption was that the carrying value of the liability component of the SPHG Note approximated fair value because the stated interest rate of this debt was consistent with current market rates. In conjunction with the application of pushdown accounting, the Company will now measure the fair value of the SPHG on a recurring basis. Refer to Note 3 - \"Exchange Transaction\" and Note 10 - \"Debt\" for further details. The Company estimates the value of the SPHG Note using a Binomial Lattice Model. Key inputs in the valuation include the trading price and volatility of Steel Connect's common stock, the risk-free rate of return, as well as the dividend rate, conversion price, and maturity date. The Company recognized $0.5 million in unrealized losses in Other gains, net within the consolidated statements of operations for the Successor Period as a result of the fair value measurement performed at July 31, 2023.\nFollowing is a summary of changes in the SPHG Note measured using Level 3 inputs:\nBalance as of May 1, 2023 (Successor): $ 13,006\nPrincipal repayment (1,000)\nUnrealized losses 455\nBalance as of July 31, 2023 (Successor) $ 12,461\nIncluded in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets are money market funds. These are valued at quoted market prices in active markets.\n(24)SEGMENT INFORMATION\nSubsequent to the Companys disposition of the Direct Marketing reportable segment in the IWCO Direct Disposal, the Company has one reportable segment: Supply Chain. The Company also has Corporate-level activity, which consists primarily of costs associated with certain corporate administrative functions such as legal, finance and share-based compensation, which are not allocated to the Company's reportable segment. The Corporate-level balance sheet information includes cash and cash equivalents, debt and other assets and liabilities which are not identifiable to the operations of the Company's operating segment. All significant intra-segment amounts have been eliminated. Management evaluates segment performance based on segment net revenue and operating income (loss).\nManagement evaluates segment performance based on segment net revenue, operating income (loss) and \"adjusted operating income (loss),\" which is defined as the operating income (loss) excluding net charges related to depreciation, amortization of long-lived asset impairment, share-based compensation and restructuring. These items are excluded because they may be considered to be of a non-operational or non-cash nature. Historically, the Company has recorded significant impairment and restructuring charges, and therefore management uses adjusted operating income (loss) to assist in evaluating the performance of the Company's core operations.\nSummarized financial information of the Company's continuing operations by operating segment is as follows:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nMay 1 to July 31, August 1, 2022 to April 30, Fiscal Year Ended July 31,\n2023 2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nNet revenue:\nSupply Chain $ 40,804 $ 148,283 $ 203,272\nTotal segment net revenue $ 40,804 $ 148,283 $ 203,272\nOperating income:\nSupply Chain 3,328 16,488 11,318\nTotal segment operating income 3,328 16,488 11,318\nCorporate-level activity (1,707) (9,699) (10,155)\nTotal operating (loss) income 1,621 6,789 1,163\nTotal other income 6,130 2,301 969\nIncome before income taxes $ 7,751 $ 9,090 $ 2,132\nSuccessor Predecessor\nJuly 31, 2023 July 31, 2022\n(In thousands)\nTotal assets:\nSupply Chain $ 146,614 $ 101,637\nCorporate 264,567 36,112\nTotal assets $ 411,181 $ 137,749\nSummarized financial information of the Company's capital expenditures and depreciation expense for the Supply Chain reportable segment is as follows:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nMay 1 to July 31, August 1, 2022 to April 30, Fiscal Year Ended July 31,\n2023 2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nCapital expenditures $ 807 $ 1,311 $ 1,485\nDepreciation expense 456 1,427 2,220\nSummarized financial information of the Company's net revenue by geographic location is as follows:\nSuccessor Predecessor\nMay 1 to July 31, August 1, 2022 to April 30, Fiscal Year Ended July 31,\n2023 2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nMainland China $ 14,649 $ 48,049 $ 72,210\nUnited States 8,800 38,262 50,426\nNetherlands 5,774 15,149 24,483\nSingapore 4,448 14,940 19,903\nCzech 3,336 19,497 16,342\nOther 3,797 12,386 19,908\nTotal consolidated net revenue $ 40,804 $ 148,283 $ 203,272\n(25)RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nAs of July 31, 2023, SPHG Holdings and its affiliates, including Steel Holdings, HNH and SPL, beneficially owned approximately 85.9% of our outstanding capital stock, including the if-converted value of the SPHG Note and shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series E Convertible Preferred Stock that vote on an as-converted basis together with our Common Stock.

The Company repaid $1.0 million in principal amount of the SPHG Note on the Amendment Date, and repaid an additional $1.0 million principal amount of the note on June 9, 2023. In connection with the SPHG Note Amendment, the Company also paid SPHG Holdings a cash amendment fee of $0.1 million, and derecognized $0.2 million of the debt discount in proportion to the reduction of the principal balance on the Amendment Date in the fiscal third quarter. No other changes were made to the terms of the SPHG Note besides the items discussed.\nAs of July 31, 2023, SPHG Holdings held $12.9 million principal amount of the SPHG Note, compared to $14.9 million principal amount at July 31, 2022.

ITEM 9.- CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNot applicable. ITEM 9A.- CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAn evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. \"Disclosure controls and procedures\" means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Based upon that evaluation, management, including the Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company's disclosure controls were effective as of July 31, 2023.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company (as such terms are defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of its financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision of and with the participation of management, including the Interim Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 31, 2023.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended July 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
