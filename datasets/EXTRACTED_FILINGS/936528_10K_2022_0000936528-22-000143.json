    "content": "Item 1. Business\nGeneral\nWashington Federal Bank, a federally-insured Washington state chartered commercial bank dba WaFd Bank (the Bank or WaFd Bank), was founded on April 24, 1917 in Ballard, Washington and is engaged primarily in providing lending, depository, insurance and other banking services to consumers, mid-sized to large businesses, and owners and developers of commercial real estate. Washington Federal, Inc., a Washington corporation was formed as the Banks holding company in November, 1994. As used throughout this document, the terms Washington Federal, the Company or \"we\" or \"us\" and \"our\" refer to the Washington Federal, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, and the term Bank or \"WaFd Bank\" refers to the operating subsidiary, Washington Federal Bank. The Company is headquartered in Seattle, Washington.\nOn January 3, 2022, the Bank announced that it had applied to the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (the \"WDFI\") to convert from a national association to a non-Federal Reserve member Washington state-chartered bank. The Bank completed the conversion of its charter from a national bank charter, supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, to a Washington state chartered commercial bank effective February 4, 2022. The Bank cancelled its holdings of stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco as part of the conversion and its legal name changed from Washington Federal Bank, National Association to Washington Federal Bank. As a result of the conversion, the WDFI is the Bank's primary state regulator and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the \"FDIC\") is the Bank's primary federal regulator. The Federal Reserve will continue to regulate the Bank's holding company, Washington Federal, Inc.\nOn November 9, 1982 the Company listed and began trading on the NASDAQ. Profitable operations have been recorded every year since going public. As of September 30, 2022, the stock traded at 81 times its original 1982 offering price, has paid 158 consecutive quarterly cash dividends and has returned 13,079% total shareholder return to those who invested 40 years ago.\nThe Company's fiscal year end is September 30th. All references herein to 2022, 2021 and 2020 represent balances as of September 30, 2022, September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively, or activity for the fiscal years then ended.\nThe business of the Bank consists primarily of accepting deposits from the general public and investing these funds in loans of various types, including first lien mortgages on single-family dwellings, construction loans, land acquisition and development loans, loans on multi-family, commercial real estate and other income producing properties, home equity loans and business loans. The Bank also invests in certain United States government and agency obligations and other investments permitted by applicable laws and regulations. As of September 30, 2022, Washington Federal Bank has 201 branches located in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. Through the Bank's subsidiaries, the Company is also engaged in insurance brokerage activities.\nThe principal sources of funds for the Company's activities are retained earnings, loan repayments, net deposit inflows, borrowings and repayments and sales of investments. Washington Federal's principal sources of revenue are interest on loans and interest and dividends on investments. Its principal expenses are interest paid on deposits, credit costs, general and administrative expenses, interest on borrowings and income taxes.\nThe regulatory structure gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities. Any change in such regulation, whether by the WDFI, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the CFPB or the U.S. Congress, could have a significant impact on the Company and its operations. See Regulation section below.\nLending Activities\nGeneral. The Company's net loan portfolio totaled $16,113,564,000 at September 30, 2022 and represents 77.6% of total assets. Lending activities include the origination of loans secured by real estate, including long-term fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans, adjustable-rate construction loans, adjustable-rate land development loans, fixed-rate and adjustable-rate multi-family loans, fixed-rate and adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans and fixed-rate and adjustable-rate business loans.\nThe following table is a summary of loans receivable by loan portfolio segment and class.\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 September 30, 2020 September 30, 2019 September 30, 2018\n($ in thousands)\nGross loans by category\nCommercial loans\nMulti-family $ 2,645,801 13.6 % $ 2,291,477 14.1 % $ 1,538,762 10.6 % $ 1,422,674 10.7 % $ 1,385,125 10.8 %\nCommercial real estate 3,133,660 16.2 2,443,845 15.0 1,895,086 13.1 1,631,170 12.3 1,452,168 11.3\nCommercial & industrial 2,350,984 12.1 2,314,654 14.2 2,132,160 14.7 1,268,695 9.5 1,140,874 8.9\nConstruction 3,784,388 19.5 2,888,214 17.7 2,403,276 16.6 2,038,052 15.3 1,890,668 14.7\nLand - acquisition & development 291,301 1.5 222,457 1.4 193,745 1.3 204,107 1.5 155,204 1.2\nTotal commercial loans 12,206,134 63.1 10,160,647 62.3 8,163,029 56.4 6,564,698 49.3 6,024,039 46.9\nConsumer loans\nSingle-family residential 5,771,862 29.8 4,951,627 30.4 5,304,689 36.7 5,835,194 43.8 5,798,966 45.1\nConstruction - custom 974,652 5.0 783,221 4.8 674,879 4.7 540,741 4.1 624,479 4.9\nLand - consumer lot loans 153,240 0.8 149,956 0.9 102,263 0.7 99,694 0.7 102,036 0.8\nHELOC 203,528 1.0 165,989 1.0 139,703 1.0 142,178 1.1 130,852 1.0\nConsumer 75,543 0.4 87,892 0.5 83,159 0.6 129,883 1.0 173,306 1.3\nTotal consumer loans 7,178,825 36.9 6,138,685 37.7 6,304,693 43.6 6,747,690 50.7 6,829,639 53.1\nTotal gross loans 19,384,959 100 % 16,299,332 100 % 14,467,722 100 % 13,312,388 100 % 12,853,678 100 %\nLess:\nAllowance for credit losses (1) 172,808 171,300 166,955 131,534 129,257\nLoans in process 3,006,023 2,232,836 1,456,072 1,201,341 1,195,506\nNet deferred fees, costs and discounts 92,564 61,626 52,378 48,938 51,834\nTotal loan contra accounts 3,271,395 2,465,762 1,675,405 1,381,813 1,376,597\nNet loans $ 16,113,564 $ 13,833,570 $ 12,792,317 $ 11,930,575 $ 11,477,081\n__________________\n(1) The reserve for unfunded commitments was $32,500,000, $27,500,000, $25,000,000, $6,900,000 and $7,250,000 as of September 30, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively.\nLending Programs and Policies. The Bank's lending activities include commercial and consumer loans, including the following loan categories.\nMulti-family residential loans. Multi-family residential (five or more dwelling units) loans generally are secured by multi-family rental properties, such as apartment buildings. In underwriting multi-family residential loans, the Bank considers a number of factors, which include the projected net cash flow to the loan's debt service requirement, the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the borrower and the borrower's experience in owning or managing similar properties. Multi-family residential loans are originated in amounts up to 80% of the appraised value of the property securing the loan.\nLoans secured by multi-family residential real estate generally involve different credit risk than single-family residential loans and carry larger loan balances. This different credit risk is a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic and societal conditions on income-producing properties, the primary source of cash flow for repayment being spread across multiple tenants, the effects of government orders such as eviction forbearance and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Repayment of loans secured by multi-family mortgages typically depends upon the successful operation of the related real estate property. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. The Bank seeks to minimize these risks through its underwriting policies, which require such loans to be qualified at origination on the basis of the property's income and debt service ratio.\nIt is the Bank's policy to obtain title insurance ensuring that it has a valid first lien on the mortgaged real estate serving as collateral for the loan. Borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance prior to closing and, when required by regulation, flood insurance. Borrowers may be required to advance funds on a monthly basis, together with each payment of principal and interest, to a mortgage escrow account from which the Bank makes disbursements for items such as real estate taxes, hazard insurance premiums and private mortgage insurance premiums when due.\nCommercial and industrial loans. The Bank makes various types of business loans to customers in its market area for working capital, acquiring real estate, equipment or other business purposes, such as acquisitions. The terms of these loans generally range from less than one year to a maximum of ten years. The loans are either negotiated on a fixed-rate basis or carry adjustable interest rates indexed to the LIBOR rate, SOFR rate, BSBY rate, prime rate or another market rate. In most cases, loan agreements indexed to the LIBOR rate include language that will provide for a replacement for LIBOR as the index rate.\nCommercial loans are made based upon assessment of the borrower's ability and willingness to repay along with an evaluation of secondary repayment sources such as the value and marketability of collateral. Most such loans are extended to closely held businesses and the personal guaranty of the principals is usually obtained. Commercial loans have a relatively high risk of default compared to residential real estate loans. Pricing of commercial loans is based on the credit risk of the borrower with consideration given to the overall relationship of the borrower, including deposits and contributed equity/loan-to-value ratio. The acquisition of business deposits is an important focus of this business line. The Bank provides a full line of treasury management products to support the depository needs of its clients.\nThe Company also participated in the Small Business Administrations Paycheck Protection Program and made various business loans under this program.\nConstruction loans. The Bank originates construction loans to finance construction of single-family and multi-family residences as well as commercial properties. Loans made to builders are generally tied to an interest rate index and normally have maturities of two years or less or are structured such that they convert to a permanent loan after the completion of construction or stabilization of the property. Loans made to individuals for construction of their home generally are 30 year fixed rate loans. The Bank's policies provide that for residential construction loans, loans may be made for 85% or less of the appraised value of the property upon completion. As a result of activity over the past four decades, the Bank believes that builders of single-family residences in its primary market areas consider the Bank to be a construction lender of choice. Because of this history, the Bank has developed a staff with in-depth land development and construction experience and working relationships with selected builders based on their operating histories and financial stability.\nConstruction lending involves a higher level of risk than single-family residential lending due to the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers and the effects of general economic conditions in the home building industry. Moreover, a construction loan can involve additional risks because of the complexities of completing the construction, the inherent difficulty in estimating both the estimated cost (including interest) of the project and the property's value at completion of the project.\nLand development loans. The Bank's land development loans are of a short-term nature and are generally made for 75% or less of the appraised value of the unimproved property. Funds are disbursed periodically at various stages of completion as authorized by the Company's personnel. The interest rate on these loans typically adjust daily or monthly in accordance with a designated index.\nLand development loans involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on owner-occupied real estate. Mitigation of risk of loss on a land development loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property's value at completion of development compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of development and the financial strength of the borrower.\nPermanent land loans. The Bank's permanent land loans (also called consumer lot loans) are generally made on improved land, with the intent of building a primary or secondary residence. These loans are limited to 70% or less of the appraised value of the property, up to a maximum loan amount of $700,000. The interest rate on permanent land loans is generally fixed for 20 years.\nSingle-family residential loans. The Bank originates 30 year fixed-rate mortgage loans secured by single-family residences. Moreover, it is the Bank's general policy to include in the documentation evidencing its conventional mortgage loans a due-on-sale clause, which facilitates adjustment of interest rates on such loans when the property securing the loan is sold or transferred.\nAll of the Bank's mortgage lending is subject to written, nondiscriminatory underwriting standards, loan origination procedures and lending policies approved by the Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\"). Property valuations are required on all real estate loans. Appraisals are prepared by independent appraisers, reviewed by staff of the Bank, and approved by the Bank's management. Property evaluations are sometimes utilized in lieu of appraisals on single-family real estate loans of $250,000 or less and are reviewed by the Bank's staff. Detailed loan applications are obtained to determine the borrower's ability to repay and the more significant items on these applications are verified through the use of credit reports, financial statements or written confirmations.\nDepending on the size of the loan involved, a varying number of officers of the Bank must approve the loan application before the loan can be granted. Federal guidelines limit the amount of a real estate loan made to a specified percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, as determined by an evaluation at the time the loan is originated. This is referred to as the loan-to-value ratio. The Board sets the maximum loan-to-value ratios for each type of real estate loan offered by the Bank.\nWhen establishing general reserves for loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80% that are not insured by private mortgage insurance, the Bank considers the additional risk inherent in these products, as well as their relative loan loss experience, and provides reserves when deemed appropriate. The total balance for loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80% at origination as of September 30, 2022, was $177,087,000, with allocated reserves of $1,578,000.\nConsumer loans. The Bank's non-mortgage consumer loan portfolio consists of prime quality student loans acquired from an independent financial investment firm that retains 1% of each loan, plus various other non-mortgage consumer loans including personal lines of credit and credit cards.\nHome equity loans. The Bank extends revolving lines of credit to consumers that are secured by a first or second mortgage on a single family residence. The interest rate on these loans adjusts monthly indexed to prime. Total loan-to-value ratios when combined with any underlying first liens held by the Bank are limited to 85% or less. Total loan-to-value ratios are limited to 80% or less when underlying first liens are held by any other investor. Loan terms are a ten year draw period followed by a fifteen year amortization period.\nOrigination and Purchase of Loans. The Bank has general authority to lend anywhere in the United States; however, its primary lending areas are within the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. Loan originations come from a variety of sources. Residential loan originations result from referrals from real estate brokers, walk-in customers, purchasers of property in connection with builder projects that are financed by the Bank, mortgage brokers and refinance activity for existing customers. Business purpose loans are obtained primarily by direct solicitation of borrowers and ongoing relationships.\nThe Bank also purchases loans and mortgage-backed securities when lending rates and mortgage volume for new loan originations in its market area do not fulfill its needs.\nThe table below shows the Company's total loan origination, purchase and repayment activities.\nTwelve Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018\n(In thousands)\nCommercial loan originations (1)\nMulti-family $ 675,534 $ 821,426 $ 403,118 $ 210,589 $ 272,046\nCommercial Real Estate 880,850 673,117 466,322 343,172 274,242\nCommercial & Industrial 2,569,682 2,509,512 2,168,908 1,020,296 869,337\nConstruction 2,486,387 2,178,260 1,457,602 1,271,167 1,068,443\nLand - Acquisition & Development 175,234 124,871 88,379 123,758 85,208\nTotal commercial loans 6,787,687 6,307,186 4,584,329 2,968,982 2,569,276\nConsumer loan originations (1)\nSingle-family residential 892,608 938,822 910,571 547,057 621,431\nConstruction - custom 765,696 621,928 576,342 457,328 523,951\nLand - Consumer Lot Loans 61,731 94,388 51,678 37,125 33,820\nHELOC 171,393 130,988 93,285 101,399 82,508\nConsumer 57,078 91,421 4,395 8,580 3,008\nTotal consumer loans 1,948,506 1,877,547 1,636,271 1,151,489 1,264,718\nTotal loans originated 8,736,193 8,184,733 6,220,600 4,120,471 3,833,994\nLoans purchased 564,584 488,147 15,456 - 143,605\nLoan principal repayments (6,194,448) (6,797,043) (5,096,622) (3,638,622) (3,335,896)\nNet change in loans in process, discounts, etc. (2)\n(826,335) (834,584) (277,692) (28,355) (47,244)\nNet loan activity increase (decrease) $ 2,279,994 $ 1,041,253 $ 861,742 $ 453,494 $ 594,459\nBeginning balance $ 13,833,570 $ 12,792,317 $ 11,930,575 $ 11,477,081 $ 10,882,622\nEnding balance $ 16,113,564 $ 13,833,570 $ 12,792,317 $ 11,930,575 $ 11,477,081\n___________________\n(1)Includes undisbursed loan in process.\n(2)Includes non-cash transactions.\nInterest Rates, Loan Fees and Service Charges. Interest rates charged by the Bank on mortgage loans are primarily determined by the competitive loan rates offered in its lending areas and in the secondary market. Mortgage loan rates reflect factors such as general interest rates, the supply of money available to the industry and the demand for such loans. General economic conditions, the regulatory programs and policies of federal and state agencies, including the Federal Reserve Banks monetary policies, changes in tax laws and governmental budgetary programs influence these factors.\nThe Bank receives fees for originating loans in addition to various fees and charges related to existing loans, including prepayment charges, late charges and assumption fees. In making one-to-four- family home mortgage loans, the Bank normally charges an origination fee and as part of the loan application, the borrower pays the Bank for out-of-pocket costs, such as the appraisal fee, whether or not the borrower closes the loan. The interest rate charged is normally the prevailing rate at the time the loan application is approved and accepted. In the case of construction loans, the Bank normally charges an origination fee. Loan origination fees and other terms of multi-family residential loans are individually negotiated.\nInvestment Activities\nThe Bank is obligated by its regulators to maintain adequate liquidity and does so by holding cash and cash equivalents and by investing in securities. These investments may include, among other things, certain certificates of deposit, repurchase agreements, bankers acceptances, loans to financial institutions whose deposits are federally-insured, federal funds, United States government and agency obligations and mortgage-backed securities.\nSources of Funds\nGeneral. Deposits are the primary source of the Banks funds for use in lending and other general business purposes. In addition to deposits, the Bank derives funds from loan repayments, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (\"FHLB\"), other borrowings, and from investment repayments and sales. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are influenced by general interest rates, money market conditions, the availability of FDIC insurance and the market perception of the Companys financial stability. Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in normal sources of funds, such as deposit inflows at lower than projected levels. Borrowings may also be used on a longer-term basis to support expanded activities and to manage interest rate risk. Borrowing capacity and availability is influenced by interest rates, market conditions, availability of collateral and the market's perception of the Bank's financial stability.\nDeposits. The Bank relies on a mix of deposit types, including business and personal checking accounts, term certificates of deposit, and other savings deposit alternatives that have no fixed term, such as money market accounts and passbook savings accounts. The Bank offers several consumer checking account products, both interest bearing and non-interest bearing and three business checking accounts, two of which target small businesses with relatively simple and straightforward banking needs and one for larger, more complex business depositors with an account that prices monthly based on the volume and type of activity. Savings and money market accounts are offered to both businesses and consumers, with interest paid after certain threshold amounts are exceeded.\nThe Banks deposits are obtained primarily from residents of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas.\nBorrowings. The Bank has a credit line with the FHLB for up to 45% of total assets, subject to availability of collateral. The Bank obtains advances from the FHLB based upon the security of the FHLB capital stock it owns and certain of its loans, provided certain standards related to credit worthiness have been met. Such advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs. Each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities, and the FHLB prescribes acceptable uses to which the advances pursuant to each program may be put, as well as limitations on the size of such advances. Depending on the program, such limitations are based either on a fixed percentage of assets or the Company's credit worthiness. FHLB advances are used to meet seasonal and other withdrawals of deposit accounts and to fund expansion of the Bank's lending.\nThe Bank may need to borrow funds for short periods of time to meet day-to-day financing needs. In these instances, funds are borrowed from other financial institutions or the Federal Reserve, for periods generally ranging from one to seven days at the then current borrowing rate. At September 30, 2022, the Bank had no such short-term borrowings.\nFor further information on these activities, see Note L to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Benefits we offer to employees include:\nHealth insurance including dental & vision.\nFlexible spending plans for healthcare and childcare expenses.\nEmployer-paid life insurance & accidental death and dismemberment coverage.\nLong-term disability insurance.\nEmployee assistance program to provide access to counseling and support well-being.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led us to evaluate how we operate in an effort to ensure our employees are able to continue working safely. The Company implemented technology upgrades that included providing most of our employees with laptops and virtual interaction platforms that allowed many of them to work remotely.\nCorporate Social and Environmental Responsibility\nWe recognize the social and environmental responsibility that arises from the impact of our activities on peoples lives and our community. The Company's Corporate and Social Environmental Policy integrates social, environmental and ethical concerns into our daily business activities and our approach to stakeholder relationships. Through this policy, we strive to carry out our banking activities in a responsible manner, placing the financial needs of our clients and economic health of our communities at the core of our focus. Below is a summary of our community activities and financial contributions in 2022.\nAdditional information will be provided in the Companys forthcoming 2022 Community and Social Responsibility Report which will be made available on the Companys website. Nothing on our website, including the aforementioned report, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.\nThe Company\nGeneral. The Company is registered as a bank holding company and is subject to regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve.\nRegulation. The Company operates in a highly regulated industry. The regulatory structure governing the Companys operations is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers, and not to benefit our shareholders. As part of this regulatory structure, the Company is subject to policies and other guidance developed by the regulatory agencies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Under this structure, regulators have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the Companys operations if they determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in a range of sanctions and enforcement actions, including the imposition of civil money penalties, formal agreements and cease and desist orders. In order to comply with regulatory requirements, the Bank has and will continue to incur additional significant costs in order to bring programs and operations into compliance.\nFor further information on regulatory matters, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data as well as the \"Risk Factors\" section of this report and the \"USA Patriot Act of 2001\" discussion below.\nSections below include a description of certain laws and regulations that relate to the regulation of the Company and the Bank. The description of these laws and regulations, and descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere herein, do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations.\nRestrictions on Activities and Acquisitions. Bank holding companies are subject to a variety of restrictions on their activities and the acquisitions they can make. Generally, the activities or acquisition of a bank holding company that is not a financial holding company are limited to those that constitute banking or managing or controlling banks or which are closely related to\nbanking. In addition, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve, bank holding companies are generally prohibited from acquiring more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, taking any action that causes a bank to become a subsidiary of the bank holding company, acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of a bank, or merging with another bank holding company.\nControl of Company or Bank. Pursuant to the Change in Bank Control Act, (the CIBC Act) individuals, corporations or other entities acquiring Company equity interests may, alone or together with other investors, be deemed to control a holding company or a bank. If an acquisition is deemed to constitute control of the holding company or bank and is not subject to approval under the Bank Holding Company Act or certain other statutes, such person or group will be required to file a notice under the CIBC Act. Generally, ownership of, or power to vote, more than 25% of any class of voting securities constitutes control. In the case of a bank or bank holding company the securities of which are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), ownership of or power to vote more than 10% of any class of voting securities creates a presumption of control.\nSource of Strength. Under long-standing Federal Reserve policy, a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial and management strength to its subsidiary bank. Under this policy, a bank holding company is expected to stand ready to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary bank during periods of financial adversity and to maintain financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to assist its subsidiary bank. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine by adopting a statutory provision requiring, among other things, that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary banks.\nRestrictions on Company Dividends. The Companys ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is affected by several factors. Since the Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and its subsidiaries and does not have significant operations of its own, the Company may not be able to pay dividends to its shareholders if the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company. The Banks ability to pay dividends is subject to various regulatory restrictions.\nIn addition, the Companys ability to pay dividends is subject to rules and policies of the Federal Reserve. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the companys expected future needs and financial condition. Capital rules adopted by the Federal Reserve, effective January 2015, may limit the Companys ability to pay dividends if the Company fails to meet certain requirements under the rules. In addition, if we do not or are unable to pay quarterly dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, we may not pay a dividend to the holders of our common stock.\nSee Washington Federal Bank, wholly-owned operating subsidiary - Restrictions on Dividends.\nSince the Company is a Washington state corporation, it is also subject to restrictions under Washington corporate law relating to dividends. Generally, under Washington law, a corporation may not pay a dividend if, after giving effect to the dividend, the corporation would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due in the ordinary course of business or the corporations total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus (with some exceptions) the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the dividend payment, to satisfy the dissolution preferences of senior equity securities.\nWashington Federal Bank, wholly-owned operating subsidiary\nGeneral. The Bank is a federally-insured Washington state chartered commercial bank dba WaFd Bank. The Bank is a member of the FDIC and its deposits are insured up to applicable limits of the Depository Insurance Fund (DIF), which is administered by the FDIC. As a result, the FDIC has certain regulatory and examination authority over the Bank.\nRegulation. The WDFI and FDIC have extensive authority over the operations of the Bank. As part of this authority, the Bank is required to file periodic reports with the WDFI and FDIC and is subject to periodic examinations by the WDFI and FDIC. As a Washington state chartered commercial bank with branches in the States of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, the Bank is subject not only to the applicable laws and regulations of Washington state, but is also subject to the applicable laws and regulations of these other states in which it does business. Various laws and regulations prescribe the investment and lending authority of the Bank, and the Bank is prohibited from engaging in any activities not permitted by such laws and regulations. While the Bank has broad authority to engage in all types of lending activities, a variety of restrictions apply to certain other investments by the Bank.\nInterstate Banking. Subject to certain limitations and restrictions, a bank holding company, with prior approval of the Federal Reserve, may acquire an out-of-state bank; banks in states that do not prohibit out-of-state mergers may merge with the\napproval of the appropriate federal banking agency, and a bank may establish a de novo branch out of state if such branching is permitted by the other state for state banks chartered by such other state.\nInsurance of Deposit Accounts. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the maximum amount of federal deposit insurance coverage was permanently increased from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor, per institution. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act raised the minimum designated reserve ratio, which the FDIC is required to set each year for the DIF, to 1.35%. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The FDIC has established a higher reserve ratio of 2% as a long-term goal beyond what is required by statute.\nBrokered Deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act prohibits an insured depository institution from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the banks normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless it is well-capitalized or is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A depository institution that is adequately capitalized and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates.\nOn December 15, 2020, the FDIC issued a final rule intended to modernize its brokered deposit regulations in light of modern deposit-taking methods. The final rule established a new framework for certain provisions of the deposit broker definition and amends the FDICs interest rate methodology for calculating the national rate, the national rate cap, and the local market rate cap. The final rule became effective on April 1, 2021 with an extended compliance date of January 1, 2022.\nTransactions with Affiliates; Insider Loans. Under current federal law, all transactions between and among a bank and its affiliates, including holding companies, are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated thereunder. Generally, these requirements limit extensions of credit and certain other such transactions by the bank to affiliates to a percentage of the institution's capital and generally such transactions must be collateralized. Generally, all affiliate transactions must be on terms at least as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, a bank may not lend to any affiliate engaged in non-banking activities that are not permissible for a bank holding company or acquire shares of any affiliate that is not a subsidiary. Federal law authorizes the imposition of additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates if necessary to protect the safety and soundness of a bank.\nExtensions of credit by a bank to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders are subject to Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, which, among other things, generally prohibits loans to any such individual where the aggregate amount exceeds an amount equal to 15% of an institution's unimpaired capital and surplus plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral. Section 22(h) permits loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to employees of a subject bank provided that no preference is given to any officer, director or principal shareholder, or related interest thereto, over any other employee. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a bank to all insiders cannot exceed the institution's unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers.\nThe affiliate transaction rules in Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act broaden the definition of affiliate and apply these rules to securities lending, repurchase agreements and derivatives. These rules also strengthen collateral requirements and limit Federal Reserve exemptive authority. Further, the definition of extension of credit for transactions with executive officers, directors and principal shareholders includes credit exposure arising from a derivative transaction, a repurchase or reverse repurchase agreement or a securities lending or borrowing transaction. These provisions have not had a material effect on the Company or the Bank.\nRestrictions on Dividends. The amount of dividends payable by the Bank to the Company depends upon its earnings and capital position, and is limited by federal and state laws, regulations and policies, including the capital conservation buffer requirement. Federal law further provides that no insured depository institution may make any capital distribution (which includes a cash dividend) if, after making the distribution, the institution would be undercapitalized, as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations. Moreover, the federal bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if such payments should be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice. In addition, under Washington law, no bank may declare or pay any dividend in an amount greater than its retained earnings without the prior approval of the WDFI. WDFI also has the power to require any bank to suspend the payment of any and all dividends.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") of Des Moines, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs that provide funding to their members for making home mortgage loans, as well as loans for affordable housing and community development. Each FHLB serves members within its assigned region and is funded primarily through proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. Loans are made to members in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB. At September 30, 2022, FHLB advances to the Bank amounted to $2,125,000,000. As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Des Moines. At September 30, 2022, the Bank held $95,073,000 in FHLB of Des Moines stock, which was in compliance with this requirement.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. Banks have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act (\"CRA\") and related regulations of the FDIC to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act (together, the \"Fair Lending Laws\") prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. An institution's failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities. Failure to comply with the Fair Lending Laws could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, the CFPB and other federal regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice.\nUSA Patriot Act of 2001. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (\"Patriot Act\"), through amendments to the federal Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), substantially broadened the scope of United States anti money-laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial scope of United States jurisdiction. The United States Treasury Department has issued a number of regulations under the Patriot Act that apply to financial institutions such as the Bank. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply satisfactorily with all relevant Patriot Act and BSA requirements, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements. Bank holding companies and federally insured banks are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital. The Federal Reserve establishes capital standards applicable to all bank holding companies, and the WDFI and FDIC establish capital standards applicable to Washington state chartered, non-member banks. The capital rules reflect, in part, certain standards initially adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010 (which standards are commonly referred to as Basel III) as well as requirements contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe capital rules require a capital ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk based assets. Common equity Tier 1 capital generally consists of retained earnings and common stock instruments (subject to certain adjustments) as well as accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) except to the extent that the Company and the Bank exercise a one-time irrevocable option to exclude certain components of AOCI, which the Company and the Bank have done. Tier 1 capital also includes non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and limited amounts of minority interests. Regulatory deductions from capital include goodwill and intangible assets. The capital rules prescribe the manner in which certain capital elements are determined, including but not limited to, requiring certain deductions related to mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and supplementary capital. Supplementary capital consists of certain capital instruments that do not qualify as core capital as well as general valuation loan and lease loss allowances up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. Supplementary capital may be used to satisfy the risk-based requirement only in an amount equal to the amount of Tier 1 capital.\nIn determining the required amount of risk-based capital, total assets, including certain off-balance-sheet items, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor based on the risks inherent in the type of assets held by an institution. The risk categories range from 0% for low-risk assets such as U.S. Treasury securities and GNMA securities to 1,250% for various types of loans and other assets deemed to be of higher risk. Single-family residential loans having loan-to-value ratios not exceeding 80% and meeting certain additional criteria, as well as certain multi-family residential loans, qualify for a 50% risk-weight treatment. The book value of each asset is multiplied by the risk factor applicable to the asset category, and the sum of the products of this calculation equals total risk-weighted assets. The rules set forth the methods of calculating certain risk-based assets, which in turn affects the calculation of risk-based ratios. Higher or more sensitive risk weights are assigned to various categories of assets, among which are commercial real estate, credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property, certain exposures or credit that are 90 days past due or are nonaccrual, foreign exposures, certain corporate exposures, securitization exposures, equity exposures and in certain cases mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets.\nBoth the Company and the Bank are required to have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%. In addition, both the\nCompany and the Bank are required to have a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 6.0% and a total risk-based ratio of 8.0%. Both the Company and the Bank are required to establish a conservation buffer, consisting of common equity Tier 1 capital, equal to 2.5%. The capital conservation buffer is designed to ensure that banks build up capital buffers outside periods of stress, which can be drawn down as losses are incurred. An institution that does not meet the conservation buffer will be subject to restrictions on certain activities including payment of dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers.\nThe Federal Reserve and the FDIC are also authorized to impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual institutions on a case-by-case basis. Management believes that the current capital levels of the Company and the Bank are sufficient to be in compliance with the fully phased-in standards under the rules.\nAny bank holding company or bank that fails to meet the capital requirements is subject to possible enforcement actions. Such actions could include a capital directive, a cease and desist or consent order, civil money penalties, restrictions on an institution's operations and/or the appointment of a conservator or receiver. Federal Reserve and WDFI capital regulations provide that such supervisory actions, through enforcement proceedings or otherwise, could require one or more of a variety of corrective actions.\nFor information regarding compliance with each of these capital requirements by the Company and the Bank as of September 30, 2022, see Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof.\nPrompt Corrective Action. Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework based on five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An institutions category depends upon its capital levels in relation to relevant capital measures, which include a risk-based capital measure, a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that implement this statutory framework.\nThe prompt corrective action rules, which apply to the Bank but not the Company, are modified to include a common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio and to increase certain other capital requirements for the various thresholds. For example, the requirements for the Bank to be considered well-capitalized under the rules are a 5.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio, a 6.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio, an 8.0% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a 10.0% total risk-based capital ratio. To be adequately capitalized, those ratios are 4.0%, 4.5%. 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively.\nAn institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits, generally. Any institution that is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized. Federal law authorizes the FDIC to reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category. The FDIC may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized. As of September 30, 2022, the Bank exceeded the requirements of a well capitalized institution.\nDodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (\"DFAST\"). On July 6, 2018, bank regulatory agencies (the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) issued a joint interagency statement regarding the impact of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (\"EGRRCPA\") on financial institutions. The EGRRCPA gave immediate relief from stress testing for applicable bank holding companies but not financial institutions until November 25, 2019. Pursuant to direction from the Bank's regulators, the Bank was provided similar relief and is no longer required to submit company-run annual stress tests. Notwithstanding these amendments to the stress testing requirements, the federal banking agencies indicated through interagency guidance that the capital planning and risk management practices of institutions with total assets less than $100 billion would continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process. Although the Bank will continue to monitor its capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators, the Bank will no longer conduct company-run stress testing as a result of the legislative and regulatory amendments. The Bank continues to use customized stress testing to support the business and as part of its risk management and capital planning process.\nEGRRCPA also enacted several important changes in some technical compliance areas that we believe will help reduce our regulatory burden, including:\nProhibiting federal banking regulators from imposing higher capital standards on High Volatility Commercial Real Estate (HVCRE) exposures unless they are for acquisition, development or construction (ADC), and clarifying ADC status;\nRequiring the federal banking agencies to amend the Liquidity Coverage Ratio Rule such that all qualifying investment-grade, liquid and readily-marketable municipal securities are treated as level 2B liquid assets, making them more attractive investment alternatives;\nExempting from appraisal requirements certain transactions involving real property in rural areas and valued at less than $400,000; and\nDirecting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to provide guidance on the applicability of the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule to mortgage assumption transactions and construction-to-permanent home loans, as well the extent to which lenders can rely on model disclosures that do not reflect recent regulatory changes.\nDespite the improvements for mid-size financial institutions such as the Company that has resulted from EGRRCPA, many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations remain in place and will continue to result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation. In addition, the EGRRCPA requires the enactment of a number of implementing regulations, the details of which may have a material effect on the ultimate impact of the law.\nCybersecurity. The federal banking agencies have established certain expectations with respect to an institution's information security and cybersecurity programs, with an increasing focus on risk management, processes related to information technology and operational resiliency, and the use of third-parties in the provision of financial services. In January 2020, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a statement reminding supervised financial institutions of sound cybersecurity risk management principles that expanded on areas articulated in the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards written in Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Sections 501 and 505(b) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nState regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements. Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity in those areas to continue, and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which the Company operates.\nIn February 2018, the SEC published interpretive guidance to assist public companies in preparing disclosures about cybersecurity risks and incidents. These SEC guidelines, and any other regulatory guidance, are in addition to notification and disclosure requirements under state and federal banking law and regulations.\nIn November 2021, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies adopted a rule regarding notification requirements for banking organizations related to significant computer security incidents. Under the final rule, a bank holding company, such as the Company, and an FDIC-supervised insured depository institution, such as the Bank, are required to notify the Federal Reserve or FDIC, respectively, within 36 hours of incidents that have materially disrupted or degraded, or are reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organizations ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base, jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking organization, or impact the stability of the financial sector. Service providers are required under the rule to notify any affected bank client it provides services to as soon as possible when it determines it has experienced a computer-security incident that has materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, covered services provided by that entity to the Bank for four or more hours.\nTaxation\nIn addition to federal income tax, the Company is also subject to income, franchise, excise or gross receipts tax in states (and some cities) where the Company has branches or is deemed to have sufficient nexus for tax purposes. The Company generally files consolidated federal and state income tax returns with its subsidiaries.\nThe Company's federal income tax returns are open and subject to potential examination by the IRS for fiscal year 2019 and later.\nCompetition\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include other banks, savings associations, community banks, credit unions and other financial intermediaries, and new market participants offering services similar to those that we offer. We compete with some competitors within our geographic market area, and with others on a product specific basis, such\nas the residential mortgage market. Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to provide first-rate, friendly and professional customer service and deliver the banking solutions that our customers want and need. We are also dependent upon our ability to attract and retain employees while managing compensation and other costs.\nAvailability of Financial Data\nUnder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), the Company is required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. We file reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, and amendments to those reports, with the SEC. The public may obtain copies of these reports at the SEC's website: www.sec.gov.\nThe Company has adopted and posted on its website a code of ethics that applies to its senior financial officers. The Companys website also includes the charters for its audit committee, compensation committee, risk management committee, nominating and governance committee and regulatory compliance committee.\nThe address for the Companys website is www.wafdbank.com. The Company makes available on its website, free of charge, its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and any amendments to those reports (among others), as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We also make available on our website public financial information for which a report is not required to be filed with or furnished to the SEC. Our SEC reports and such other information can be accessed through the investor relations section of our website (https://www.wafdbank.com/about-us/investor-relations). The Companys website provides a link to all our filings on the SECs Edgar website, and the company will provide a printed copy of any of our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and any amendments to those reports (among others) to any requesting shareholder, free of charge. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report that we file or furnish to the SEC. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOwnership of our common stock involves risk. Investors should carefully consider, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors. The risks described below may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are not the only risks we face; additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently considered to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business.\nOperational Risks\nCurrent uncertain economic conditions pose challenges, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are operating in an uncertain economic environment. The pandemic caused a global economic slowdown, and while we have seen economic recovery, continuing supply chain issues, labor shortages and inflation risk are affecting the continued recovery. Continued economic uncertainty and a recessionary or stagnant economy could result in financial stress on the Bank's borrowers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We decreased the expense for credit losses over fiscal year 2021 and 2022 as the economy began to recover, however, deteriorating conditions in the regional economies we serve, or in certain sectors of those economies, could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses. We could also face the following risks in connection with the following events:\nMarket developments and economic stagnation or slowdown may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, resulting in increased delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities.\nThe processes we use to estimate the allowance for credit losses and other reserves may prove to be unreliable. Such estimates rely upon complex modeling inputs and judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, which may be rendered inaccurate and/or no longer subject to accurate forecasting.\nOur ability to assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite loans become less predictive of future charge-offs.\nRegulatory scrutiny of the industry could increase, leading to increased regulation of the industry that could lead to a higher cost of compliance, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities and increase our exposure to litigation or fines.\nIneffective monetary policy or other market conditions could cause rapid changes in interest rates and asset values that would have a materially adverse impact on our profitability and overall financial condition.\nFurther erosion in the fiscal condition of the U.S. Treasury could lead to new taxes that would limit our ability to pursue growth and return profits to shareholders.\nIf these conditions or similar ones continue to exist or worsen, we could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on our financial condition.\nFluctuating interest rates could adversely affect our business.\nSignificant increases in market interest rates on loans, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect both our ability to originate new loans and our ability to grow. Beginning early in 2022, in response to growing signs of inflation, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates rapidly. Further, the Federal Reserve has increased the benchmark rapidly and has announced an intention to take further actions to mitigate inflationary pressures. Rapid changes in interest rates make it difficult for the Bank to balance its loan and deposit portfolios, which may adversely affect our results of operations by, for example, reducing asset yields or spreads, creating operating and system issues, or having other adverse impacts on our business. Conversely, decreases in interest rates could result in an acceleration of loan prepayments. The increased market interest rates could also adversely affect the ability of our floating-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge offs, which could adversely affect our business.\nFurther, our profitability is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income, which is the difference (or spread) between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits, borrowings, and other interest-bearing liabilities. Because of the differences in maturities and repricing characteristics of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread, and, in turn, our profitability. Although it is expected that the Federal Reserve will continue to\nincrease the target federal funds rate in 2023 to combat recent inflationary trends, if interest rates do not rise, or if the Federal Reserve were to lower the target federal funds rate to below 0%, these low rates could continue to constrain our interest rate spread and may adversely affect our business forecasts. On the other hand, increases in interest rates, to combat inflation or otherwise, may result in a change in the mix of noninterest and interest-bearing accounts. All else being equal, if the interest rates on the Company's interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest-earning assets, the result would be a reduction in net interest income and with it, a reduction in net earnings. We are unable to predict changes in interest rates, which are affected by factors beyond our control, including inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply and other changes in financial markets.\nInflationary pressures and rising prices may affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nInflation has continued rising in 2022 at levels not seen for over 40 years. Inflationary pressures are currently expected to remain elevated throughout 2022 and are likely to continue into 2023. Inflation could lead to increased costs to our customers, making it more difficult for them to repay their loans or other obligations increasing our credit risk. Sustained higher interest rates by the Federal Reserve may be needed to tame persistent inflationary price pressures, which could push down asset prices and weaken economic activity. A deterioration in economic conditions in the United States and our markets could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and non-performing assets, decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services, all of which, in turn, would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to monetary policy by the Federal Reserve could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe Federal Reserve is responsible for regulating the supply of money in the United States, including open market operations used to stabilize prices in times of economic stress, as well as setting monetary policies. These activities strongly influence our rate of return on certain investments, our hedge effectiveness for mortgage servicing and our mortgage origination pipeline, as well as our costs of funds for lending and investing, all of which may adversely impact our liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and capital position.\nUnstable global economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition, and operations.\nThe global credit and financial markets have from time to time experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, high rates of inflation, and uncertainty about economic stability. The financial markets and the global economy may also be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which is increasing volatility in commodity and energy prices, creating supply chain issues and causing instability in financial markets. Sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries in response to such conflict could further adversely impact the financial markets and the global economy, and any economic countermeasures by the affected countries or others could exacerbate market and economic instability. The specific consequences of the conflict in Ukraine on our business is difficult to predict at this time, but in addition to inflationary pressures affecting our operations and those of our customers and borrowers, we may also experience an increase in cyberattacks against us, our customers and borrowers, service providers and other third parties. There can be no assurance that further deterioration in markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment, hostile third-party action or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions.\nOur allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\") may not be adequate to cover future loan losses, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to the declining economic conditions, our customers may not be able to repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. While we maintain our ACL to provide for loan defaults and non-performance, losses may exceed the value of the collateral securing the loans and the allowance may not fully cover any excess loss.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. Our ACL is based on these judgments, as well as historical loss experience and an evaluation of the other risks associated with our loan portfolio, including but not limited to, economic trends and conditions, changes in underwriting standards, management, competition, and trends in delinquencies, non-accrual and adversely classified loans. the size and composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and geographic concentrations within the portfolio. Federal regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, review our loans and ACL. If our assumptions and judgments used to determine the ACL\nprove to be incorrect, if the value of the collateral securing the loans decreases substantially or if regulators disagree with its judgments, we may need to increase the ACL in amounts that exceed our expectations. Material additions to the ACL would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risks related to our operational, technological, and third-party provided technology infrastructure.\nWe rely extensively on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of information technology and telecommunications systems to conduct our business. This includes internally developed systems, internally managed systems, outsourced systems provided by third-party service providers, internet facing digital products and services, mobile technologies and the on-going operational maintenance of each service. Any disruptions, failures, or inaccuracies of these systems, including changes and improvements, could result in our inability to service customers, manage operations, manage risk, meet regulatory obligations, or provide timely and accurate financial reporting which could damage our reputation, result in loss of customer business, subject us to regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nIn many instances, the Companys products and services to customers are dependent upon third-party service providers, who provide necessary, or critical, services and support. Any disruption of such services, or an unplanned termination of a third-party license or service agreement related thereto, could adversely affect our ability to provide necessary products and services for our customers.\nIn recent years, we have made a significant ongoing investment to enhance our technological capabilities with the objectives of enhancing customer experience, growing revenue, and improving operating efficiency. There is a risk that these investments may not provide the anticipated benefits and/or will prove significantly more costly and time consuming to produce. If this occurs, we may see a loss of customers, and our financial results and ability to execute on our strategic plan may be adversely impacted.\nWe are exposed to risks related to fraud and cyber-attacks.\nCybersecurity, and the continued development and enhancement of controls, processes, and practices designed to protect customer information, systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access remain a priority for the Company. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance, modify, and refine our protective measures against these evolving threats.\nWe are continuously enhancing and expanding our digital products and services to meet customer and business needs with desired outcomes. These digital products and services often include storing, transmitting, and processing confidential customer, employee, financial, and business information. Due to the nature of this information, and the value it has for internal and external threat actors, we, and our third-party service providers, continue to be subject to cyber-attacks and fraud activity that attempts to gain unauthorized access, misuse information and information systems, steal information, disrupt or degrade information systems, spread malicious software, and other illegal activities.\nWe have recently changed our consumer online and mobile banking platforms to provide more flexibility and customizable feature sets to improve customer experience. This change provides the Company more opportunity to differentiate ourselves in the market, but also increases our direct responsibility for managing cybersecurity risk associated with digital banking, when historically, the responsibility for providing adequate safeguards and security controls was managed by third party vendors.\nWe believe we have robust preventive, detective, and administrative safeguards and security controls to minimize the probability and magnitude of a material event. However, because the tactics and techniques used by threat actors to bypass safeguards and security controls change frequently, and often are not recognized until after an event has occurred, we may be unable to anticipate future tactics and techniques, or to implement adequate and timely protective measures.\nIn June 2022, we were notified by a third-party vendor that it experienced a network security incident involving unauthorized access to certain personal and financial data of some of our customers. We immediately suspended services with the vendor. After the incident was detected, this third-party vendor engaged a third-party security firm to investigate the incident, provide support to remove the unauthorized access, enhance its security controls, and help the third-party vendor safely resume operations. After an investigation into the extent of the data that was compromised we notified all customers impacted by this breach. There was no breach of our own systems due to this incident. After receiving assurances that this third-party is operating in a safe and secure manner, we have resumed operations with it. We are not aware of any continuing cybersecurity threats or breaches involving this vendor or our systems generally. Future incidents involving this vendor or other third-party service providers could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation and could require us to incur substantial expenses, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTo date, we have no knowledge of a successful cyber-attack or other material information security breach affecting the systems we operate and control. However, our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the continuation of a remote or hybrid work environment for our employees and service providers, and our plans to continue to implement and expand digital banking services, expand operations, and use third-party information systems that includes cloud-based infrastructure, platforms, and software. Recent instances of attacks specifically targeting banks and financial services businesses indicate that the risk to our systems remains significant. We, and our third-party providers, are regularly the subject of attempted attacks and the ability of the attackers continues to grow in sophistication. Potential threats to our technologies, systems, networks, and other devices, as well as those of our employees, third party vendors, and other third parties with whom we interact, include DDoS attacks, computer viruses, hacking, malware, ransomware, credential stuffing, or phishing or other forms of social engineering. Such cyber-attacks and other security incidents are designed to lead to various harmful outcomes, such as unauthorized transactions our customers accounts, unauthorized or unintended access to or release, gathering, monitoring, disclosure, loss, destruction, corruption, disablement, encryption, misuse, modification or other processing of confidential or sensitive information (including personal information), intellectual property, software, methodologies or business secrets, disruption, sabotage or degradation of service, systems or networks, or other damage. These threats may derive from, among other things, error, fraud or malice on the part of our employees, insiders, or third parties or may result from accidental technological failure. Any of these parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, service providers, customers, partners or other third-party users of our systems or networks to disclose confidential or sensitive information (including personal information) in order to gain access to our systems, networks or data or that of our customers, partners, or third parties with whom we interact, or to unlawfully obtain monetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. For example, any party that obtains our confidential or sensitive information (including personal information) through a cyber-attack or other security incident may use this information for ransom, to be paid by us or a third party, as part of a fraudulent activity that is part of a broader criminal activity, or for other illicit purposes. A cyber-attack or other security incident on the systems we operate and control could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation, result in productivity losses, require us to incur substantial expenses, including response costs associated with investigation and resumption of services, remediation expenses costs associated with customer notification and credit monitoring services, increased insurance premiums, regulatory penalties and fines, and costs associated civil litigation, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also face additional costs when our customers become the victims of cyber-attacks. For example, various retailers have reported that they have been the victims of a cyber-attack in which large amounts of their customers data, including debit and credit card information, is obtained. Our customers may be the victims of phishing scams, providing cyber criminals access to their accounts, or credit or debit card information. In these situations, we incur costs to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent transaction activity affecting our customers, as well as potential increases to insurance premiums for policies we may maintain to cover these losses.\nBoth internal and external fraud and theft are risks. If confidential customer, employee, monetary, or business information were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or if such information were to be intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties, or if our own employees abused their access to financial systems to commit fraud against our customers and the Company. These activities can occur in connection with activities such as the origination of loans and lines of credit, ACH transactions, wire transactions, ATM transactions, and checking transactions, and result in financial losses as well as reputational damage.\nOperational errors can include information system misconfiguration, clerical or record-keeping errors, or disruptions from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors, which may be automated or manual, may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Because of the Companys large transaction volume and its necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process these transactions, there is a risk that technical flaws, tampering, or manipulation of those automated systems, arising from events wholly or partially beyond its control, may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability for us to operate our business, additional costs to correct defects, potential liability to clients, reputational damage. and regulatory intervention, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar health crisis, may adversely affect our business and our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers in the future.\nThe spread of COVID-19 created a global public-health crisis that resulted in significant economic uncertainty, and has impacted household, business, economic, and market conditions, including in the western United States where we conduct nearly all of our business.\nThroughout the pandemic our operations have been impacted by the need to close certain offices and limit how customers conduct business through our branch network. Many of our employees continue to work remotely, which exposes us to increased cybersecurity risks such as phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, all of which could expose us to liability and could seriously disrupt our business operations.\nContinuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar crisis, could negatively impact our capital, liquidity, and other financial positions and our business, results of operations, and prospects. A resurgence in spread, caused by the rise of new variants, could affect significantly more households and businesses, or cause additional limitations on commercial activity, increased unemployment, increased property vacancy rates and general economic and financial instability. A slow-down or reversal in the economic recovery of the regions in which we conduct our business could result in declines in loan demand and collateral values. Negative impacts on our customers caused by COVID-19 could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures and losses on our loans. The duration and severity of the pandemic continues to be impossible to predict, as is the potential for a seasonal or other resurgence. We also believe we will continue to see the economic effects of the pandemic even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, which is expected to continue to affect our business, financial position, operations and prospects.\nAdditional actions of governmental authorities. To date, many of the actions of governmental authorities, including eviction forbearance, occupancy restrictions and vaccine mandates, have been directed toward curtailing household and business activity to contain COVID-19 while simultaneously deploying fiscal and monetary policy measures to partially mitigate the adverse effects on individual households and businesses. The ultimate success or impact of these actions and their effect on our customers and the economy generally is still unclear. Further, some measures, such as a suspension of mortgage and other loan payments and foreclosures, may have a negative impact on our business.\nThe effect on our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers. COVID-19 and its associated consequences and uncertainties are affecting individuals, households, and businesses differently and unevenly. Negative impacts on our customers could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures and losses on our loans.\nThe effect on economies and markets. Whether the actions of governmental and nongovernmental authorities will be successful in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19 is unclear. National, regional, and local economies and markets could suffer disruptions that are lasting. Governmental actions are meaningfully influencing the interest-rate environment and financial-market activity and could have lasting effects on taxes and other economic factors, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGovernments have taken unprecedented steps to partially mitigate the adverse effects of their containment measures. For example, in late March 2020, the CARES Act was enacted to inject more than $2 trillion of financial assistance into the U.S. economy, followed by additional COVID relief legislation of approximately $900 million in December 2020. In March 2021 the American Rescue Plan Act, also called the COVID-19 Stimulus Package or American Rescue Plan, Pub L. No. 117-2, was enacted to inject an additional $1.9 trillion in financial relief and economic stimulus. Whether the economic stimulus will have a lasting positive effect or whether it will contribute to higher inflation or other economic ill effects is unknown.\nAs a participating lender in the SBA Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), we are subject to additional risks of litigation from our customers or other parties regarding our processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the CARES Act, which included a loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. Under the PPP (and its expansion in 2021), small businesses and other entities and individuals were eligible to apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. We participated as a lender in the PPP, and ultimately assisted approximately 9,000 businesses with approximately $1,085,000,000 in PPP loans. As of September 30, 2022, approximately 8,800 PPP loans totaling approximately $1,075,000,000 have been forgiven by the SBA, and we continued to hold PPP loans receivable of $10,141,000.\nWe have credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which a PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. In\nthe event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us. In addition, several larger banks were subject to litigation regarding their processing of PPP loan applications. We could be exposed to the risk of similar litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached us seeking PPP loans. We and other PPP lenders may also be subject to the risk of litigation in connection with other aspects of the PPP, including but not limited to borrowers seeking forgiveness of their loans. If any such litigation is filed against us, it may result in significant financial or reputational harm to us.\nIf we are not able to retain or attract key employees, or if we were to suffer the loss of a significant number of employees, we could experience a disruption in our business.\nIf a key employee or a substantial number of employees depart or become unable to perform their duties, it may negatively impact our ability to conduct business as usual. We might then have to divert resources from other areas of our operations, which could create additional stress for other employees, including those in key positions. The loss of qualified and key personnel, or an inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business and consequently impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and losses to us.\nOur risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate and compliance. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. Our risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and may not adequately mitigate any risk of loss to us. If our framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our financial condition, operations or business prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences.\nClimate change could adversely affect our business, affect client activity levels and damage our reputation.\nConcerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses are also changing their behavior and business preferences as a result of these concerns. New governmental regulations or guidance relating to climate change, as well as changes in consumers and businesses behaviors and business preferences, may affect whether and on what terms and conditions we will engage in certain activities or offer certain products or services. The governmental and supervisory focus on climate change could also result in our becoming subject to new or heightened regulatory requirements, such as requirements relating to operational resiliency or stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. Any such new or heightened requirements could result in increased regulatory, compliance or other costs or higher capital requirements. In connection with the transition to a low carbon economy, legislative or public policy changes and changes in consumer sentiment could negatively impact the businesses and financial condition of our clients, which may decrease revenues from those clients and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients. Our business, reputation and ability to attract and retain employees may also be harmed if our response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient.\nFurthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change will have a negative impact our customers and their business. Physical risks include extreme storms that damage or destroy property and inventory securing loans we make, or may interrupt our customers business operations , putting them in financial difficulty, and increasing the risk of default. Our customers are also facing changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate change, as well as new regulatory requirements resulting in increased operational costs.\nRegulatory and Litigation Risks\nFailure to comply with the 2020 and 2013 Consent Orders from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regarding our Home Mortgage Disclosure Act submissions could result in additional regulatory enforcement action.\nIn March 2020, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB) Office of Enforcement formally notified us of alleged violations of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) associated with our HMDA reporting submissions. The CFPB alleged that the Bank did not accurately report all required relevant information within the annual HMDA submissions. We responded to the CFPB, noting that the Bank has instituted enhanced procedures to ensure compliance with HMDA, and submitted amended HMDA filings. In October 2020, after further discussions with the CFPB, we entered into a consent order related to our HMDA reporting, under which we agreed to pay a $200,000 civil money penalty and implement a HMDA compliance management system while adhering to a compliance plan. The consent order will be in effect for 10 years. We had previously entered in a consent order with the CFPB in 2013, also relating to HMDA reporting deficiencies, resulting in a\n$34,000 civil money penalty. The 2013 HMDA Consent Order remains in effect. Any further deficiencies in our HMDA reporting submissions could result in additional regulatory enforcement actions, cause us to incur additional significant compliance costs and subject us to larger fines. Moreover, continued deficiencies in our HMDA reporting could have serious reputational consequences for the Bank. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-Compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Truth-in-Lending Act, Community Reinvestment Act, Fair Lending Laws, Flood Insurance Reform Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions, and curtail our expansion opportunities.\nFinancial institutions are required under the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act) and Bank Secrecy Act (\"BSA\") to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money-laundering (\"AML\") and terrorist activities. Financial institutions are also obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules also require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure or the inability to comply with the Patriot Act and BSA statutes and regulations could result in fines or penalties, curtailment of expansion opportunities, enforcement actions, intervention or sanctions by regulators and costly litigation or expensive additional controls and systems. During the last few years, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations, and we were subject to a Consent Order and have paid a civil money penalty with respect to our BSA Program, as described below. In addition, the U.S. Government imposed and is expected to continue to expand laws and regulations relating to residential and consumer lending activities that could create significant new compliance burdens and financial costs.\nThe Bank was previously subject to a Consent Order from the OCC for its BSA program that was issued in February 2018 (the BSA Consent Order). The BSA Consent Order resulted in the Bank incurring significant expenses to comply with it, including payment of a $2,500,000 civil money penalty. The OCC terminated the BSA Consent Order in December 2021. However, the Bank remains subject to the BSA, the Patriot Act, and other laws and regulations requiring financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. Failure to maintain an effective BSA program could have serious business, financial and reputational consequences for the Bank. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, which limits the manner and scope of our business activities.\nWe are subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by the WDFI, CFPB and the FDIC. In addition, the Federal Reserve is responsible for regulating the holding company. This regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not to benefit our shareholders. This regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations (including laws and regulations governing consumer credit, and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws), but also capital adequacy, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, data reporting and various other factors. As part of this regulatory structure, we are subject to policies and other guidance developed by the regulatory agencies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Under this structure the WDFI, the FDIC, the CFPB and the Federal Reserve have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on our operations if they determine, among other things, that our operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. This supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct, growth and profitability of our operations.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in a range of sanctions and enforcement actions, including the imposition of civil money penalties, formal agreements and cease and desist orders; identified deficiencies in our HMDA reporting and BSA/AML programs have resulted in Consent Orders from the CFPB and OCC, required us to incur significant expenses and compliance costs and subjected us to civil penalties. Failure to meet regulatory requirements could require the Bank to incur additional significant costs in order to bring our programs and operations into compliance, negatively impact our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the FDIC has specific authority to take prompt corrective action, depending on the Bank's capital level. Currently, the Bank is considered well-capitalized for prompt corrective action purposes. If the Bank were designated as adequately capitalized, its ability to take brokered deposits would become limited. If the Bank were to be designated in one of the lower capital levels undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, it would be required to raise additional capital and would be subject to progressively more severe restrictions on its operations, management\nand capital distributions, and replacement of senior executive officers and directors. If the Bank became critically undercapitalized, it would also be subject to the appointment of a conservator or receiver.\nRecent national and state legislation and regulatory initiatives to support the financial services industry have been coupled with numerous restrictions and requirements that could detrimentally affect our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has had a substantial impact on the financial services industry since its passage in 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act creates a framework through which regulatory reform has been and continues to be written. While many of the rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act have been implemented, others are still being drafted. As a result, the impact of the future regulatory requirements continues to be uncertain. We expect the way we conduct business to continue to be affected by these regulatory requirements, including through limitations on our ability to pursue certain lines of business, capital requirements, enhanced reporting obligations, and increased costs.\nOther legislative initiatives could detrimentally impact our operations in the future. The extent of the impact of any such legislation will be dependent on the specific details of the final legislation passed, if any.\nDeposit insurance premiums could increase further in the future.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions, including the Bank. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund (\"DIF\") at a specific level. Historically, unfavorable economic conditions increased bank failures and these additional failures decreased the DIF. In order to restore the DIF to its statutorily mandated minimums the FDIC significantly increased deposit insurance premium rates, including the Bank's. FDIC insurance premiums could increase in the future in response to similar declining economic conditions. More recently, extraordinary growth in insured deposits caused the ratio of the DIF to total insured deposits to fall below the current statutory minimum of 1.35%. The FDIC has also established a higher reserve ratio of 2% as a long term goal and the minimum level needed to withstand future financial crises of the magnitude of past crises. The FDIC may increase the assessment rates or impose additional special assessments in the future to restore and then steadily increase the DIF to these statutory target levels. Any increase in the Bank's FDIC premiums could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various claims and litigation, which could result in significant expenses, losses and damage to our reputation.\nWe are, from time to time, subject to claims and proceedings related to our operations. These claims and legal actions could include supervisory or enforcement actions by our regulators, criminal proceedings by prosecutorial authorities, or civil claims by our customers, former customers, contractual counterparties, and current and former employees. We may also face class action lawsuits for alleged violations of employment, state wage and hour and consumer protection laws. These claims could involve large monetary demands, including civil money penalties or fines imposed by government authorities, and significant defense costs. If such claims and legal actions are brought, and are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they could result in financial liability and/or reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBanking institutions are also increasingly the target of class action lawsuits. Most recently there has been an increase in claims filed claiming deceptive practices or violations of account terms in connection with non-sufficient funds or overdraft charges. In September 2020, we received notice a similar class action had been filed against the Bank, alleging that we have been improperly charging our customers overdraft fees on items re-presented for payment. In May 2022, the Bank settled this lawsuit for a payment of $495,000 plus claims administrative expenses. In June 2022, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement, and the claims administration process is ongoing. If the settlement is not approved by the court, or if another class action lawsuit is filed or determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement agreement in connection with such a matter, we could be exposed to monetary damages, reputational harm, or subject to limits on our ability to operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, and operating results.\nOur real estate lending also exposes us to the risk of environmental liabilities.\nIn the course of our business, it is necessary to foreclose and take title to real estate, which could subject us to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. Hazardous substances or waste, contaminants, pollutants or sources thereof may be discovered on properties during our ownership or after a sale to a third party. We could be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at such properties. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be\nsubstantial and could substantially exceed the value of the real property. In addition, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. We may be unable to recover costs from any third party. These occurrences may materially reduce the value of the affected property, and we may find it difficult or impossible to use or sell the property prior to or following any environmental remediation. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nMarket and Industry Risks\nOur operations are focused in the western United States, subjecting us to the risks of general economic conditions in these market areas.\nSubstantially all of the Bank's loans are to individuals, businesses and real estate developers in the Pacific Northwest, Arizona, Utah, Texas, New Mexico and Nevada. As a result, our business depends significantly on general economic conditions in these market areas. A substantial increase in unemployment rates, or severe declines in housing prices and property values in these primary market areas could have a material adverse effect on our business due to a number of factors, including:\nLoan delinquencies may increase.\nProblem assets and foreclosures may increase.\nDemand for the Bank's products and services may decline.\nCollateral for loans made by the Bank, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing a customer's borrowing power and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with the loans.\nNatural disasters and catastrophic events such as wildfires, floods and earthquakes may damage or destroy collateral for loans made by the Bank and negatively impact the collaterals value and a customers ability to repay loans.\nA downturn in the real estate market would hurt our business.\nThe Banks business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in real estate lending, in particular commercial real estate loans which are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or certain other types of loans or investments. The market for real estate is cyclical and the outlook for this sector is uncertain. A downturn in the real estate market, accompanied by falling values and increased foreclosures would hurt our business because a large majority of our loans are secured by real estate.\nIf a significant decline in market values occurs, the collateral for loans will provide decreasing levels of security. As a result, our ability to recover the principal amount due on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate will be diminished, and we will be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. Because our loan portfolio contains commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of these loans may cause a significant increase in our nonperforming loans which could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses, or an increase in loan charge-offs, any of which would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe own real estate as a result of foreclosures resulting from non-performing loans. If other lenders or borrowers liquidate significant amounts of real estate in a rapid or disorderly fashion, or if the FDIC elects to dispose of significant amounts of real estate from failed financial institutions in a similar fashion, it could have an adverse effect on the values of the properties owned by the Company by depressing the value of these real estate holdings. In such a case, we may incur further write-downs and charge-offs, which could, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in retail distribution strategies and consumer behavior may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have significant investments in bank premises and equipment for our branch network as well as our retail work force and other branch banking assets. Advances in technology such as e-commerce, telephone, internet and mobile banking, and in-branch self-service technologies including automatic teller machines and other equipment, as well as changing customer preferences for these other methods of accessing our products and services, could decrease the value of our branch network or other retail distribution assets and may cause us to change our retail distribution strategy, close and/or sell certain branches or parcels of land held for development and restructure or reduce our remaining branches and work force. These actions could lead to losses on these assets or could adversely impact the carrying value of other long-lived assets and may lead to increased expenditures to renovate and reconfigure remaining branches or to otherwise reform our retail distribution channel. In addition,\nany changes in our branch network strategy could adversely impact our business, financial condition or operations if it results in the loss of customers or deposits which we rely on as a low cost and stable source of funds for our loans and operations.\nWe may suffer losses in our loan portfolio due to inadequate or faulty underwriting and loan collection practices.\nThere are risks inherent in any loan portfolio, which we attempt to address by adhering to specific underwriting and loan collection practices. Underwriting practices often include analysis of a borrower's prior credit history; financial statements; tax returns; cash flow projections; valuation of collateral; personal guarantees of loans to businesses; and verification of liquid assets. If the underwriting process fails to capture accurate information or proves to be inadequate, we may incur losses on loans that appeared to meet our underwriting criteria, and those losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in the allowance for credit losses. Loan collection resources may be expanded to meet increases in nonperforming loans resulting from economic downturns or to service any loans acquired, resulting in higher loan administration costs. We are also exposed to the risk of improper documentation of foreclosure proceedings that would also increase the cost of collection.\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk, and changes in market interest rates may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by interest-earning assets and the interest expense generated by interest-bearing liabilities. The level of net interest income is a function of the average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the amounts of the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by such external factors as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (the FOMC) and market interest rates. Management is unable to predict these external factors, including the fluctuations of market interest rates, which are affected by many drivers, including inflation, recession, unemployment, monetary policy, domestic and international disorder, instability in domestic and foreign financial markets and investor and consumer demand.\nFurthermore, movements in interest rates, the pace at which such movements occur and the volume and mix of our interest-bearing assets and liabilities influence the level of net interest income. The cost of customer deposits is largely based on short-term interest rates, the level of which is driven by the FOMC. However, the yields generated by long-term loans, such as single-family residential and multifamily mortgage loans, and securities are typically driven by longer-term (10 year) interest rates, which are set by the market and vary from day to day. Further, recent changes in the Federal Reserve's purchase of assets, commonly known as \"quantitative easing,\" have created significant volatility in market interest rates and recent, rapid increases in federal benchmark rates and likely additional increases in such rates are creating additional uncertainty and making it more difficult for us to balance our loan and deposit portfolios.\nFor example, if the interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on interest-earning assets, the result could be a reduction in our net interest income and with it, a reduction in earnings. The same could be true if interest rates on interest-earning assets decline faster than the rates on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income and earnings would be similarly impacted were the interest rates on interest-earning assets to decline more quickly than the interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, changes in interest rates could affect the Bank's ability to originate loans and attract and retain deposits; the fair values of its securities and other financial assets; the fair values of its liabilities; and the average lives of its loan and securities portfolios. Additionally, decreases in interest rates could lead to increased loan refinancing activity, which, in turn, would alter the balance of our interest-earning assets and impact net interest income. Increases in interest rates could reduce loan refinancing activity, which could result in compression of the spread between loan yields and more quickly rising funding rates.\nWe may also be exposed to movements in market rates to a degree not experienced by other financial institutions, as a result of our significant portfolio of fixed-rate single-family home loans, which are longer-term in nature than the customer accounts and borrowed money that constitute our liabilities.\nOur liquidity may be adversely impacted by issues arising from certain industry deficiencies in foreclosure practices, including delays and challenges in the foreclosure process.\nForeclosure process issues and the potential legal and regulatory responses to them could negatively impact the process and timing to completion of foreclosures for residential mortgage lenders, including the Bank. Due to the COVID-19 emergency, certain states in which we do business enacted temporary stays on evictions and foreclosures, or instituted a right to forbearance for homeowners experiencing financial hardship. Even before the adoption of these emergency policies, foreclosure timelines have increased in recent years due to, among other reasons, delays associated with the significant increase in the number of foreclosure cases as a result of economic downturns, additional consumer protection initiatives related to the\nforeclosure process and voluntary or mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure. Should these stays or rights to forbearance continue, we may be limited in our ability to take timely possession of real estate assets collateralizing loans, which may increase our loan losses. Increases in the foreclosure timeline may also have an adverse effect on collateral values and the our ability to minimize our losses.\nThe replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate may have an impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCertain loans made by us are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. In addition, we also have investments and interest rate derivatives that reference LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdoms Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") announced that it intended to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. On November 30, 2020 to facilitate an orderly LIBOR transition the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve jointly announced that entering into new contracts using LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021 would create a safety and soundness risk. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of 1-week and 2-month U.S. dollar LIBOR, and immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates are ongoing, and the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (\"ARRC\") has recommended the use of a Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\"SOFR\"). SOFR is different from LIBOR in that it is a backward looking secured rate rather than a forward looking unsecured rate. These differences could lead to a greater disconnect between the Bank's costs to raise funds for SOFR as compared to LIBOR. For cash products and loans, the ARRC has also recommended Term SOFR, which is a forward looking SOFR based on SOFR futures and may in part reduce differences between SOFR and LIBOR. To further reduce differences between replacement indices and substitute indices market practitioners have also gravitated towards credit sensitive rates, the leading among them being the Bloomberg Short-term Bank Yield Index (BSBY). The ARRC announced on October 21, 2020 that they are not well positioned to adjudicate the development of a credit sensitive rate and will not criticize firms solely for using reference rates other than SOFR, such as BSBY. The Company has prepared to originate new loans to customers based on SOFR, Term SOFR, BSBY, Prime and other indices but market acceptance or availability of these or other alternate reference rates remain uncertain. The implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers may incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, may result in reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept the substitute index or indices, and may result in disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established or the establishment of multiple alternative reference rate(s). These consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us.\nCompetitive Risks\nOur ability to originate mortgage loans has been adversely affected by the increased competition resulting from the involvement of the U.S. Government, the Federal Reserve and Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) in the residential mortgage market.\nOver the past few years, we have faced increased competition for mortgage loans due to the increased involvement of the GSEs in the mortgage market, which has caused interest rates for thirty year fixed-rate mortgage loans that conform to GSE guidelines to remain artificially low. Mortgage loan repayments on one-to-four family residential properties have been elevated, and it is possible that these mortgage loan repayments will outpace our loan production as a result of this competition, making it difficult for us to grow our mortgage loan portfolio and balance sheet, and having an adverse effect on our business.\nThe Bank faces strong competition from other financial institutions and new market participants, offering services similar to those offered by the Bank.\nMany competitors, including fintech companies, offer the same types of loan and deposit services that the Company offers. These competitors include national and multinational banks, other regional banks, savings associations, community banks, credit unions and other financial intermediaries. In particular, our competitors include national banks and major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, recent technological breakthroughs have made it possible for other non-traditional competitors to enter the marketplace and compete for traditional banking services. Increased competition within our geographic market area may result in reduced loan originations and deposits. Ultimately, competition from current and future competitors may affect our business materially and adversely.\nWe may not be able to continue to grow organically or through acquisitions.\nHistorically, we have expanded through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. If market and regulatory conditions change, we may be unable to grow organically or successfully compete for, complete, and integrate potential future acquisitions at the same pace as we have achieved in recent years, or at all. We have historically used our strong stock currency and capital resources to complete acquisitions. Downturns in the stock market and the market price of our stock, changes in our capital position, and changes in our regulatory standing could each have a negative impact on our ability to complete future acquisitions.\nSecurity Ownership Risks\nOur ability to pay dividends is subject to limitations that may affect our ability to continue to pay dividends to shareholders.\nThe Company is a separate legal entity from the bank subsidiary and does not have significant operations of its own. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by the Bank's earnings and capital, as well as various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the Bank may not be able to pay dividends to the Company. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, then we may not be able to pay dividends on our preferred or common stock to our shareholders. There are various federal law limitations on the extent to which the Bank can finance or otherwise supply funds to the Company through dividends and loans. These limitations include capital adequacy regulations and policies of its regulators generally and specifically the FDICs Prompt Corrective Action regulations, federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates, as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices. If the Bank earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, then our liquidity may be affected and our stock price may be negatively affected by our inability to pay dividends, which will have an adverse impact on both the Company and our shareholders.\nOur 4.875% Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (Series A Preferred Stock) ranks senior to our Common Stock, and we are prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock unless we have paid dividends on our Series A Preferred.\nShares of our Series A Preferred Stock rank senior to our Common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as, and if declared by our Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee of our Board of Directors), out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends under Washington law, non-cumulative cash dividends based on the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock at a rate equal to 4.875% per annum for each quarterly dividend period, beginning on April 15, 2021. If we do not or are unable to pay quarterly dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, we may not pay a dividend to the holders of our Common Stock. Our stock price may be negatively affected by our inability to pay dividends, which will have an adverse impact on both the Company and our shareholders.\nIn addition, if we fail to pay, or declare and set apart for payment, dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock for six quarterly dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors on our Board of Directors will automatically be increased by two, and the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will have the right to elect two additional members of our Board of Directors (the Preferred Stock Directors) to fill such newly created directorships.\nThe market price for our Common Stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our Common Stock could fluctuate substantially in the future in response to a number of factors, including those discussed below. The market price of our Common Stock has in the past fluctuated significantly. We expect to see additional volatility in the financial markets due to the uncertainty caused by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, disruption in global supply chains, uncertainty over the U.S. government debt ceiling and changing Federal Reserve policy. Some additional factors that may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\ngeneral conditions in the financial markets and real estate markets.\nmacro-economic and political conditions in the U. S. and the financial markets generally (including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic).\nvariations in the operating results of the Company and our competitors.\nevents affecting other companies that the market deems comparable to the Company.\nchanges in securities analysts' estimates of our future performance and the future performance of our competitors.\nannouncements by the Company or our competitors of mergers, acquisitions and strategic partnerships.\nadditions or departure of key personnel.\nthe presence or absence of short selling of the Company's Common Stock.\nfuture sales by us of our Common Stock or debt securities.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced substantial price and trading fluctuations. These fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance. These broad market fluctuations are expected to continue for the near future, and may adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of the Company's equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock or depositary shares.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock, preferred stock, or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, Common Stock or preferred stock. Our Board of Directors is authorized to cause Washington Federal to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock junior to our Series A Preferred Stock from time to time without any action on the part of our shareholders, and our Board of Directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over the Common Stock with respect to dividends or upon our dissolution, winding up and liquidation and other terms. Although the approval of holders of depositary shares representing interests in the Series A Preferred Stock will be needed to issue any equity security ranking above the Series A Preferred Stock, if we were to issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, or if we were to issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the Series A Preferred Stock or depositary shares, the rights of holders of the depositary shares or the market price of the depositary shares could be adversely affected.\nThe issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities or the exercise of such securities could be substantially dilutive to existing shareholders. For instance, exercise of the warrant issued to the U.S. Treasury in connection with our participation in the Capital Purchase Program diluted the value of our Common Stock. We may also elect to use Common Stock to fund new acquisitions, which will dilute existing shareholders. Holders of our Common Stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our shareholders.\nWe rely, in part, on external financing to fund our operations and the unavailability of such funding in the future could adversely impact our growth and prospects.\nWe rely on customer deposits, advances from the FHLB and other borrowings to fund our operations. Management has historically been able to replace maturing deposits, if desired; however, we may not be able to replace such funds at any given point in time if our financial condition or market conditions change or if the cost of doing so might adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we consider current sources of funds adequate for our liquidity needs, we may seek additional debt in the future to achieve our long-term business objectives. Such borrowings, if sought, may not be available to us or, if available, may not be on favorable terms. If additional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on reasonable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nA person holding our Common Stock could have the voting power of their shares of Common Stock on all matters significantly reduced under Washington's anti-takeover statutes, if the person acquires 10% or more of the voting stock of the Company.\nWe are incorporated in the state of Washington and subject to Washington state law. Some provisions of Washington state law could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change-in-control events affecting us. For example, Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, with limited exceptions, prohibits a target corporation from engaging in specified significant business transactions for a period of five years after the share acquisition by an acquiring person, unless:\nthe prohibited transaction or the acquiring person's purchase of shares was approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation's board of directors prior to the acquiring person's share acquisition; or\nthe prohibited transaction was both approved by the majority of the members of the target corporation's board and authorized at a shareholder meeting by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting shares (excluding the acquiring\nperson's shares) at or subsequent to the acquiring person's share acquisition. An acquiring person is defined as a person or group of persons that beneficially own 10% or more of the voting securities of the target corporation. Such prohibited transactions include, among other things:\ncertain mergers, or consolidations with, disposition of assets to, or issuances of stock to or redemption of stock from, the acquiring person;\ntermination of 5% or more of the employees of the target corporation as a result of the acquiring person's acquisition of 10% or more of the shares;\nallowing the acquiring person to receive any disproportionate benefit as a shareholder; and\nliquidating or dissolving the target corporation.\nAfter the five-year period, certain significant business transactions are permitted, if they comply with certain fair price provisions of the statute or are approved by a majority of the outstanding shares other than those of which the acquiring person has beneficial ownership. As a Washington corporation, the Company is not permitted to opt out of this statute.\nThe Companys business or the value of its common shares could be negatively affected as a result of actions by activist shareholders.\nThe Company values constructive input from shareholders, and our Board of Directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of the Companys shareholders. Activist shareholders who disagree with the composition of the Board of Directors, the Companys strategic direction, or the way the Company is managed may seek to effect change through various strategies that range from private engagement to public filings, proxy contests, efforts to force transactions not supported by the Board of Directors, and litigation. Responding to some of these actions can be costly and time-consuming, may disrupt the Companys operations and divert the attention of the Board of Directors and management. Such activities could interfere with the Companys ability to execute its strategic plan and to attract and retain qualified executive leadership. The perceived uncertainty as to the Companys future direction resulting from activist strategies could also affect the market price and volatility of the Companys common shares. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone. Item 2. Properties\nThe Company owns the building in which its principal executive offices are located in Seattle, Washington, as well as certain branch properties. The Company evaluates on a continuing basis the suitability and adequacy of its offices, both branches and administrative centers, and has opened, relocated, remodeled or closed locations as necessary to maintain efficient and attractive premises. For further information on these activities, see Notes J and M to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nThe Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings occurring in the ordinary course of business that in the aggregate are believed by management to be immaterial to the financial statements of the Company. The effects of legal proceedings did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNone.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nCommon Stock\nThe Companys common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol WAFD. At September 30, 2022, the number of shareholders of record was 1,134. This figure does not represent the actual number of beneficial owners of common stock because shares are frequently held in street name by securities dealers and others for the benefit of individual owners who may vote the shares.\nAdditional information about stock options and other equity compensation plans is included in Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\nThe Companys ability to pay dividends is subject to bank regulatory requirements, including (but not limited to) the capital adequacy regulations and policies established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Companys Board of Directors' dividend policy is to review our financial performance, capital adequacy, regulatory compliance and cash resources on a quarterly basis, and, if such review is favorable, to declare and pay a quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders.\nThe Companys 4.875% Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Series A Preferred), ranks senior to the Companys common stock with respect to payment of dividends, and dividends (if declared) accrue and are payable on the Series A Preferred a rate of 4.875% per annum, payable quarterly, in arrears. While the Series A Preferred is outstanding, unless the full dividend for the preceding quarterly period is paid in full, or declared and a sum set aside, no dividend may be declared or paid on the Companys common stock.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe Companys stock repurchase program was publicly announced by the board of directors on February 3, 1995 and has no expiration date. Under this program, a total of 76,956,264 shares of the Companys common stock have been authorized for repurchase. The following table shows the share repurchases made for the three months ended September 30, 2022.\nPeriod Total Number of\nShares Purchased Average Price\nPaid Per Share Total Number of\nShares Purchased\nas Part of Publicly\nAnnounced Plan Maximum\nNumber of Shares\nThat May Yet Be\nPurchased Under\nthe Plan at the\nEnd of the Period\nJuly 1, 2022 to July 31, 2022 570 $ 30.03 570 3,725,304\nAugust 1, 2022 to August 31, 2022 309 34.68 309 3,724,995\nSeptember 1, 2022 to September 30, 2022 651 31.26 651 3,724,344\nTotal 1,530 $ 31.49 1,530 3,724,344\nPerformance Graphs\nThe following graphs compare the cumulative total return to Washington Federal shareholders (stock price appreciation plus reinvested dividends) to the cumulative total return of the Nasdaq Stock Market Index (U.S. Companies) and the KBW Bank Index for the five year period ended September 30, 2022, and since Washington Federal first became a publicly traded company on November 9, 1982, respectively. The graphs assume that $100 was invested on September 30, 2017, and November 9, 1982, respectively, in Washington Federal Common Stock, the Nasdaq Stock Market Index and the Nasdaq Financial Stocks Index, and that all dividends were reinvested. Management of Washington Federal cautions that the stock price performance shown in the graphs below should not be considered indicative of potential future stock price performance. Item 6.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. In the following discussion, unless otherwise noted, references to increases or decreases in average balances in items of income and expense for a particular period and balances at a particular date refer to the comparison with corresponding amounts for the period or date for the previous year.\nIn addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. For management's review of the factors that affected our results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2021, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 19, 2021.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe Company has determined that the only accounting policy critical to an understanding of its consolidated financial statements relates to the methodology for determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses (ACL).\nManagements determination of the amount of the ACL is a critical accounting estimate as it requires significant reliance on the credit risk we ascribe to individual borrowers, the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on individually evaluated loans, significant reliance on historical loss rates on homogenous portfolios, consideration of our quantitative and qualitative evaluation of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts.\nGoing forward, the methodology used to calculate the ACL will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. Material changes to these and other relevant factors may result in greater volatility to the allowance for credit losses, and therefore, greater volatility in our reported earnings.\nSelect information regarding the ACL is below in \"Allowance for Credit Losses.\" For further details, see Notes A and E to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

As of September 30, 2022, the allowance of $172,808,000 is for loans that are evaluated on a pooled basis, which was comprised of $115,245,000 related to the quantitative component and $57,563,000 related to management's qualitative overlays.\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $3,000,000 in 2022, compared to a provision of $500,000 for 2021. In 2022, provisioning for net growth in unfunded commitments and the loan portfolio was mostly offset by improvements in the credit quality of certain loan portfolios related to strong real estate markets and collateral conditions. For the year ended September 30, 2022, net recoveries were $3,508,000, compared to $6,345,000 in the prior year. No allowance was recorded for PPP loans, which are included in the commercial & industrial loan category, due to the government guarantee. The ratio of the total ACL to total gross loans, excluding PPP loans, decreased to 1.06% as of September 30, 2022, as compared to 1.22% as of September 30, 2021. The decrease was primarily related to improvements in the credit quality of certain loan portfolios related to strong real estate markets and collateral conditions.\nThe reserve for unfunded loan commitments was $32,500,000 as of September 30, 2022, compared to $27,500,000 as of September 30, 2021.\nManagement believes the total ACL is sufficient to absorb estimated losses inherent in the portfolio of loans and unfunded commitments.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth the amount of the Companys allowance for loan losses by loan portfolio and class (periods prior to 2020 applied the incurred loss model as the current expected credit loss methodology (\"CECL\") was implemented in 2020).\nSeptember 30, 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018\nAllowance Loans to Total Loans (1) Coverage Ratio (2) Allowance Loans to Total Loans (1) Coverage Ratio (2) Allowance Loans to Total Loans (1) Coverage Ratio (2) Allowance Loans to Total Loans (1) Coverage Ratio (2) Allowance Loans to Total Loans (1) Coverage Ratio (2)\n($ in thousands)\nCommercial loans\nMulti-family $ 12,013 16.2 % 0.5 % $ 16,949 16.3 % 0.8 % $ 13,853 11.8 % 0.9 % $ 7,391 11.7 % 0.5 % $ 8,329 11.9 % 0.6 %\nCommercial real estate 25,814 19.1 0.8 23,437 17.4 1.0 22,516 14.4 1.2 13,170 13.5 0.8 11,852 12.5 0.8\nCommercial & industrial 57,210 14.2 2.5 45,957 16.3 2.0 38,665 16.5 1.8 31,450 10.5 2.5 28,702 9.8 2.5\nConstruction 26,161 8.7 1.9 25,585 7.9 2.3 24,156 10.5 1.8 32,304 9.6 2.8 31,317 9.1 3.0\nLand - acquisition & development 12,278 1.3 5.8 13,447 1.3 7.5 10,733 1.2 7.0 9,155 1.3 5.7 7,978 1.1 6.5\nTotal commercial loans 133,476 125,375 109,923 93,470 88,178\nConsumer loans\nSingle-family residential 25,518 35.4 0.4 30,978 35.5 0.6 45,186 40.8 0.9 30,988 48.2 0.5 33,033 49.7 0.6\nConstruction - custom 3,410 2.4 0.9 4,907 2.5 1.4 3,555 2.3 1.2 1,369 2.1 0.5 1,842 2.5 0.6\nLand - consumer lot loans 5,047 0.9 3.4 4,939 1.0 3.4 2,729 0.8 2.7 2,143 0.8 2.2 2,164 0.8 2.2\nHELOC 2,482 1.3 1.2 2,390 1.2 1.5 2,571 1.1 1.8 1,103 1.2 0.8 781 1.1 0.6\nConsumer 2,875 0.5 4.0 2,711 0.6 3.2 2,991 0.6 3.6 2,461 1.1 1.9 3,259 1.5 1.9\nTotal consumer loans 39,332 45,925 57,032 38,064 41,079\nTotal allowance for loan losses (3) $ 172,808 100 % $ 171,300 100 % $ 166,955 100 % $ 131,534 100 % $ 129,257 100 %\n___________________\n(1)Represents the loans receivable for each respective loan class as a % of total loans receivable.\n(2)Represents the allowance for each respective loan class as a % of loans receivable for that same loan class.

TDRs are reserved for under the Company's CECL methodology. Most TDRs are performing and accruing loans where the borrower has proactively approached the Company about modifications due to temporary financial difficulties. Each request is individually evaluated for merit and likelihood of success. The concession for these loans is typically a payment reduction through a rate reduction of 100 to 200 basis points for a specific term, usually six to twelve months. Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period.\nConcessions for construction, land A&D and multi-family loans are typically an extension of maturity combined with a rate reduction of normally 100 basis points. Before granting approval to modify a loan in a TDR, a borrowers ability to repay is considered by evaluating current income levels, debt-to-income ratio, credit score, loan payment history and an updated evaluation of the secondary repayment source.\nIf a loan is on non-accrual status before becoming a TDR, it will stay on non-accrual status following restructuring until it has been performing for at least six months, at which point it may be moved to accrual status. If a loan is on accrual status before it becomes a TDR, and it is concluded that a full repayment is highly probable, it will remain on accrual status following restructuring. If the homogeneous restructured loan does not perform, it is placed in non-accrual status when it is 90 days delinquent. For commercial loans, six consecutive payments on newly restructured loan terms are required prior to returning the loan to accrual status. After the required six consecutive payments are made, a management assessment may conclude that collection of the entire principal and interest due is still in doubt. In those instances, the loan will remain on non-accrual. A loan that defaults and is subsequently modified would impact the Company's delinquency trend, which is part of the qualitative risk factors component of the CECL methodology. Any modified loan that re-defaults and is charged-off would impact the quantitative component of the CECL methodology.\nNon-Performing Assets. When a borrower violates a condition of a loan, the Bank attempts to cure the default by contacting the borrower. In most cases, defaults are cured promptly. If the default is not cured within an appropriate time frame, typically 90 days, the Bank may institute appropriate action to collect the loan, such as making demand for payment or initiating foreclosure proceedings on the collateral. If foreclosure occurs, the collateral will typically be sold at public auction and may be purchased by the Bank.\nLoans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in the judgment of management, the probability of collecting interest or principal is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income. The Bank does not accrue interest on loans 90 days past due or more. See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof for additional information.\nThe Bank will consider modifying the interest rate and terms of a loan if it determines that a modification is deemed to be the best option available for collection in full or to minimize the loss to the Bank. Most loans restructured in TDRs are accruing and performing loans where the borrower has proactively approached the Bank about a modification due to temporary financial difficulties. Each request is individually evaluated for merit and likelihood of success. The modification of these loans is typically a payment reduction through a rate reduction of between 100 to 200 bps for a specific term, usually six to twelve months. Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period. Principal forgiveness generally is not an available option for restructured loans. As of September 30, 2022, single-family residential loans comprised 82.5% of restructured loans. The Bank reserves for restructured loans within its pool based general reserve methodology, except in instances where management considers it appropriate to evaluate individually.\nReal estate acquired by foreclosure or deed-in-lieu thereof (REO or Real Estate Owned) is classified as real estate held for sale. When property is acquired, it is recorded at the fair market value less estimated selling costs at the date of acquisition. Interest accrual ceases on the date of acquisition and all costs incurred in maintaining the property from that date forward are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred for the improvement or development of such property is capitalized. See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof for additional information.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company's restructured loans and non-performing assets.\nSeptember 30, 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018\n(In thousands)\nPerforming restructured loans $ 55,823 $ 63,655 $ 89,072 $ 116,659 $ 150,667\nNon-performing restructured loans 994 1,473 2,336 5,018 6,191\nTotal restructured loans 56,817 65,128 91,408 121,677 156,858\nNon-accrual loans:\nCommercial loans\nMulti-family 5,912 475 - - 27,643\nCommercial real estate 4,691 8,038 3,771 5,835 2,427\nCommercial & industrial 5,693 365 329 1,292 -\nConstruction - 505 1,669 - 920\nLand - acquisition & development - 2,340 - 169 787\nTotal commercial loans 16,296 11,723 5,769 7,296 31,777\nConsumer loans\nSingle-family residential 17,450 19,320 22,431 25,271 -\nConstruction - custom 435 - - - 8,971\nLand - consumer lot loans 84 359 243 246 14,394\nHELOC 233 287 553 907 523\nConsumer 36 60 60 11 21\nTotal consumer loans 18,238 20,026 23,287 26,435 23,909\nTotal non-accrual loans (1) 34,534 31,749 29,056 33,731 55,686\nReal estate owned 6,667 8,204 4,966 6,781 11,298\nOther property owned 3,353 3,672 3,673 3,314 3,109\nTotal non-performing assets 44,554 43,625 37,695 43,826 70,093\nTotal non-performing assets and performing restructured loans $ 100,377 $ 107,280 $ 126,767 $ 160,485 $ 220,760\nTotal non-performing assets and restructured loans as a percent of total assets 0.48 % 0.55 % 0.67 % 0.97 % 1.39 %\nTotal non-performing assets to total assets 0.21 % 0.22 % 0.20 % 0.27 % 0.44 %\n___________________\n(1) For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company recognized $3,334,000 in interest income on cash payments received from borrowers on non-accrual loans. The Company would have recognized interest income of $1,330,000 for the same period had these loans performed according to their original contract terms. The recognized interest income may include more than twelve months of interest for some of the non-accrual loans that were brought current or paid off. In addition to the non-accrual loans reflected in the above table, the Company had $173,348,000 of loans that were less than 90 days delinquent at September 30, 2022 but were classified as substandard for one or more reasons. If these loans were deemed non-performing, the Company's ratio of total non-performing assets and performing restructured loans as a percent of total assets would have increased to 1.32% at September 30, 2022. For a discussion of the Company's policy for placing loans on non-accrual status, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.\nNon-performing assets increased 2.1% to $44,554,000, or 0.21% of total assets, at September 30, 2022, compared to $43,625,000, or 0.22% of total assets, at September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily a result of $2,785,000 higher non-accrual loans partially offset by a $1,537,000 decline in real estate owned. Other property owned of $3,353,000 as of September 30, 2022 is comprised entirely of a government guarantee related to equipment obtained via a commercial loan foreclosure.\nTDRs declined to $56,817,000 as of September 30, 2022, from $65,128,000 as of September 30, 2021.

During 2022, there were TDR additions of $5,950,000 and reductions of $14,261,000 due to prepayments and transfers to REO. As of September 30, 2022, 82.5% of TDRs are comprised of single-family residential loans.\nAs of September 30, 2022, real estate owned totaled $6,667,000, a decrease of $1,537,000, or 18.7%, from $8,204,000 as of September 30, 2021, primarily due to sales of REO properties partially offset by new REO additions. During 2022, the Company sold real estate owned properties for total net proceeds of $6,978,000. The majority of REO properties are former bank premises that are expected to be sold.\nThe ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-accrual loans decreased to 500% as of September 30, 2022, from 540% as of September 30, 2021.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION\nCash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $683,965,000 at September 30, 2022, as compared to $2,090,809,000 at September 30, 2021. The change was primarily due to funding growth in the loan portfolio of $2,279,994,000 partially offset by the $487,458,000 increase in customer accounts and $405,000,000 increase in FHLB borrowings.\nAvailable-for-sale investment securities: Available-for-sale securities decreased $87,222,000, or 4.1%, during the year ended September 30, 2022, to $2,051,037,000, primarily due to a $123,077,000 decline in the value of available-for-sale securities, principal repayments of $510,156,000 and sales of $5,020,000, partially offset by purchases of $587,942,000. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had a net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities of $111,700,000, which is recorded net of tax as part of shareholders' equity.\nSubstantially all of the Companys available-for-sale debt securities are issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss. The remaining securities are issued by highly-rated municipalities or corporate borrowers. The Company does not believe that any of its available-for-sale debt securities have credit loss impairment as of September 30, 2022, therefore, no allowance was recorded. The impact going forward will depend on the composition, characteristics, and credit quality of the loan and securities portfolios as well as the economic conditions at future reporting periods.\nHeld-to-maturity investment securities: Held-to-maturity securities increased by $97,274,000 to $463,299,000, or 26.6%, during the year ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to purchases of $195,357,000 partially offset by principal repayments and maturities of $95,326,000. There were no held-to-maturity securities sold during the year ended September 30, 2022. Rising interest rates may cause these securities to be subject to unrealized losses. As of September 30, 2022, the net unrealized loss on held-to-maturity securities was $56,439,000, which management attributes to the change in interest rates since acquisition.\nSubstantially all of the Companys held-to-maturity debt securities are issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss. The Company did not record an allowance for credit losses for held-to-maturity securities as of September 30, 2022 as the investment portfolio consists primarily of U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities that management deems to have immaterial risk of loss. The impact going forward will depend on the composition, characteristics, and credit quality of the loan and securities portfolios as well as the economic conditions at future reporting periods.\nThe table below shows the available-for-sale and held-for-investment securities portfolios categorized by maturity band.\nSeptember 30, 2022 Amortized\nCost Weighted Average Yield\n($ in thousands)\nDue in less than 1 year $ 75,000 3.74 %\nDue after 1 year through 5 years 214,341 3.50\nDue after 5 years through 10 years 358,617 3.05\nDue after 10 years 1,978,078 3.27\n$ 2,626,036 3.28 %\nFor further information on our investment portfolio, see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

To ensure a continuity of this trend, the Bank expects to continue to offer market rates of interest. The ability to retain maturing time deposits is difficult to project; however, the Bank believes that by competitively pricing these certificates, levels deemed appropriate by management can be achieved on a continuing basis.\nAt September 30, 2022, the Bank had $804,410,000 of time deposits in amounts of $250,000 or more outstanding, maturing as follows: $232,735,000 within 3 months; $277,930,000 over 3 months through 6 months; $167,565,000 over 6 months through 12 months; and $126,180,000 thereafter.\nTime deposits with a maturity of one year or less have penalties for premature withdrawal equal to 90 days of interest. When the maturity is greater than one year but less than four years, the penalty is 180 days of interest. When the maturity is\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\ngreater than four years, the penalty is 365 days of interest. Early withdrawal penalty fee income for the years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020 amounted to $267,000, $198,000 and $539,000, respectively.\nFor additional details on customer accounts, including uninsured deposits, see Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\nFHLB advances: FHLB advances increased to $2,125,000,000 as of September 30, 2022, as compared to $1,720,000,000 at September 30, 2021. Strong growth in in loans receivable were partially funded by new FHLB borrowings. The weighted average rate for FHLB borrowings was 2.02% as of September 30, 2022, versus 1.51% at September 30, 2021, the increase being primarily due to higher rates on new short-term borrowings. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk and convert certain FHLB advances to fixed rate payments. Taking into account these hedges, the weighted average effective maturity of FHLB advances at September 30, 2022 is 3.25 years.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCOMPARISON OF 2022 RESULTS WITH 2021\nNet Income: Net income increased $52,715,000, or 28.7%, to $236,330,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $183,615,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021. The change was due to the factors described below.\nNet Interest Income: For the year ended September 30, 2022, net interest income was $594,589,000, an increase of $89,480,000 or 17.7% from the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in net interest income from the prior year was primarily due to average interest-earning assets increasing by $776,307,000 or 4.3% while average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $273,037,000 or 1.9%. During 2022, the average balance of loans receivable increased $1,873,469,000 or 14.2%, while the combined average balances of mortgage backed securities, other investment securities and cash decreased by $1,061,655,000 or 22.6%. Average noninterest-bearing deposits grew by $569,347,000 over the same period. The change in net interest income was also impacted by the average rate earned on interest-earning assets increasing by 26 basis points while the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities declined by 11 basis points.\nRate/Volume Analysis\nThe table below sets forth certain information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense of the Company for the years indicated. For each category of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability, information is provided on changes attributable to: (1) changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (2) changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by old average volume). The change in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in both volume and rate has been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.\nTwelve Months Ended September 30,\n2022 vs. 2021\nIncrease (Decrease) Due to 2021 vs. 2020\nIncrease (Decrease) Due to 2020 vs. 2019\nIncrease (Decrease) Due to\nVolume Rate Total Volume Rate Total Volume Rate Total\n(In thousands) (In thousands) (In thousands)\nInterest income:\nLoan portfolio $ 74,710 $ (10,778) $ 63,932 $ 40,365 $ (48,413) $ (8,048) $ 21,197 $ (43,585) $ (22,388)\nMortgage-backed securities (3,101) 4,725 1,624 (16,011) (8,593) (24,604) (13,094) (12,079) (25,173)\nInvestments (1) (9,347) 18,540 9,193 18,824 (15,827) 2,997 19,566 (22,206) (2,640)\nAll interest-earning assets 62,262 12,487 74,749 43,178 (72,833) (29,655) 27,669 (77,870) (50,201)\nInterest expense:\nCustomer accounts 2,170 (1,442) 728 11,184 (69,183) (57,999) 9,781 (31,685) (21,904)\nFHLB advances and other borrowings (9,002) (6,457) (15,459) (6,003) (1,254) (7,257) (35) (16,710) (16,745)\nAll interest-bearing liabilities (6,832) (7,899) (14,731) 5,181 (70,437) (65,256) 9,746 (48,395) (38,649)\nChange in net interest income $ 69,094 $ 20,386 $ 89,480 $ 37,997 $ (2,396) $ 35,601 $ 17,923 $ (29,475) $ (11,552)\n___________________\n(1)Includes interest on cash equivalents and dividends on stock of the FHLB of Des Moines and FRB of San Francisco.\nProvision (Release) for Credit Losses: The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $3,000,000 in 2022, compared to a provision of $500,000 for 2021. In 2022, provisioning for net growth in unfunded commitments and the loan portfolio was mostly offset by improvements in the credit quality of certain loan portfolios related to strong real estate markets and collateral conditions. For the year ended September 30, 2022, net recoveries were $3,508,000, compared to $6,345,000 in the prior year.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOther Income: Other income was $66,372,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $5,811,000, or 9.6%, from $60,561,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase is primarily due to unrealized gains recorded for certain equity investments being $3,555,000 higher in the year ended September 30, 2022.\nOther Expense: Operating expense was $358,575,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $26,116,000, or 7.9%, from the $332,459,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021. Compensation and benefits costs increased $17,811,000 or 10.1% year-over-year primarily due to annual merit increases, higher bonus compensation accruals related to strong deposit and loan growth, and strategic investments in top talent as well as contract staff to support strategic projects. Information technology costs increased by $4,465,000 in 2022 as compared to 2021 as we continue to execute becoming a digital first bank. The Companys efficiency ratio was 54.3% for 2022 as compared to 58.8% for the prior year. The number of staff, including part-time employees on a full-time equivalent basis, was 2,132 and 2,082 at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Total operating expense for the years ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 were 1.78% and 1.72%, respectively, of average assets.\nGain (Loss) on Real Estate Owned: Net gain on real estate owned was $651,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022, compared to a net gain of $427,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021. This amount includes ongoing maintenance expense, periodic valuation adjustments, and gains (losses) on sales of REO.\nIncome Tax Expense: Income tax expense was $63,707,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $14,184,000, or 28.6%, from the $49,523,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase is mostly due to a 28.7% increase in pre-tax income. The effective tax rate for 2022 was 21.23% as compared to 21.24% for the year ended September 30, 2021. The effective tax rate of 21.23% for 2022 differs from the statutory rate of 21% mainly due to the effects of state taxes, tax exempt income, tax credit investments and certain differences in book and tax deductions.\nCOMPARISON OF 2021 RESULTS WITH 2020\nFor management's review of the factors that affected our results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2021, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 19, 2021.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe principal sources of funds for the Company's activities are loan repayments (including prepayments), net deposit inflows, borrowings, repayments and sales of investments and retained earnings, if applicable. The Company's principal sources of revenue are interest on loans and interest and dividends on investments. Additionally, the Company earns fee income for loan, deposit, insurance and other services.\nOn February 8, 2021, in connection with an underwritten public offering, the Company issued 300,000 shares of 4.875% Noncumulative Perpetual Series A Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred Stock). Net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and expenses, were $293,325,000. The public offering consisted of the issuance and sale of 12,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of the Series A Preferred Stock, at a public offering price of $25.00 per depositary share. Holders of the depositary shares are entitled to all proportional rights and preferences of the Series A Preferred Stock (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). The depositary shares are traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol \"WAFDP.\" The Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at the option of the Company, subject to all applicable regulatory approvals, on or after April 15, 2026.\nThe Company's shareholders' equity at September 30, 2022, was $2,274,260,000, or 10.95% of total assets, as compared to $2,126,064,000, or 10.82% of total assets, at September 30, 2021. The Company's shareholders' equity was impacted in the year by net income of $236,330,000, the payment of $61,576,000 in common stock dividends, payment of $14,625,000 in preferred stock dividends, $3,260,000 of treasury stock purchases, as well as other comprehensive loss of $17,304,000. The Company paid out 28.0% of its 2022 earnings in cash dividends to common shareholders, compared with 38.1% last year. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company returned 27.4% of net income to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases as compared to 226% for the year ended September 30, 2021. Management believes the Company's strong net worth position allows it to manage balance sheet risk and provide the capital support needed for controlled growth in a regulated environment. The Companys share repurchase program may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time, and the timing and amount of share repurchases is subject to market conditions and the market price of the Companys common stock, as well as other factors.\nThe Bank has a credit line with the FHLB up to 45% of total assets depending on specific collateral eligibility. This line provides a substantial source of additional liquidity if needed. Based on collateral pledged as of September 30, 2022, the Bank had $3,564,720,000 of additional borrowing capacity at the FHLB.\nThe Bank has entered into borrowing agreements with the FHLB to borrow funds under a short-term floating rate cash management advance program and fixed-rate term advance agreements. All borrowings are secured by stock of the FHLB, deposits with the FHLB, and a blanket pledge of qualifying loans receivable as provided in the agreements with the FHLB. The Bank is also eligible to borrow under the Federal Reserve Bank's primary credit program.\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents were $683,965,000 at September 30, 2022, which is a 67.3% decrease from the balance of $2,090,809,000 as of September 30, 2021. The change was primarily due to funding growth in the loan portfolio of $2,279,994,000 partially offset by the $487,458,000 increase in customer accounts and $405,000,000 increase in FHLB borrowings. See Changes in Financial Condition above and the Statement of Cash Flows included in the financial statements for additional details regarding this change.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents the Company's significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations, within the categories described below, by contractual maturity or payment amount.\nSeptember 30, 2022 Total Less than\n1 Year 1 to 5\nYears Over 5\nYears\n(In thousands)\nCustomer accounts (1) $ 16,029,570 $ 15,476,743 $ 552,827 $ -\nDebt obligations (2) 2,125,000 2,025,000 100,000 -\nOperating lease obligations 30,695 6,215 16,697 7,783\n$ 18,185,265 $ 17,507,958 $ 669,524 $ 7,783\n(1) Includes non-maturing customer transaction accounts.\n(2) Represents contractual maturities of FHLB advances. Taking into account cash flow hedges, the weighted average effective maturity of FHLB advances at September 30, 2022 is 3.25 years.\nThese obligations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The payment amounts of the operating lease obligations represent those amounts contractually due. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nThe primary source of income for the Company is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred for interest-bearing liabilities. The level of net interest income is a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the difference between the yield on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Both the pricing and mix of the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities influence these factors. All else being equal, if the interest rates on the Company's interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on its interest-earning assets, the result would be a reduction in net interest income and with it, a reduction in net earnings.\nInterest rate risk arises in part due to the Bank's significant holdings of fixed-rate single-family home loans, which are longer-term than customer accounts that constitute its primary liabilities. Accordingly, assets do not usually respond as quickly to changes in interest rates as liabilities. In the absence of management action, net interest income can be expected to decline when interest rates rise and to expand when interest rates fall. Shortening the maturity or repricing of the investment portfolio is one action that management can take. The composition of the investment portfolio was 39.1% variable rate and 60.9% fixed rate as of September 30, 2022 to provide some protection against rising rates. In addition, the Bank is producing more commercial loans that have shorter terms and/or variable rates and has increased less rate sensitive transaction deposit accounts to 79.2% of the deposit portfolio.\nThe Company's balance sheet strategy, in conjunction with low operating costs, has allowed the Company to manage interest rate risk, within guidelines established by the Board, through all interest rate cycles. It is management's objective to grow the dollar amount of net interest income, through the rate cycles, acknowledging that there will be some periods of time when that will not be feasible. Cash and cash equivalents of $683,965,000 and shareholders' equity of $2,274,260,000 provide management with flexibility in managing interest rate risk. Based on management's assessment of the current interest rate environment, the Company has taken steps, including growing commercial loans having shorter average lives and transaction deposit accounts, to position itself for changing interest rates.\nNet Interest Income Sensitivity. We estimate the sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates using an interest rate simulation model that includes assumptions related to the level of balance sheet growth, deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments for multiple interest rate change scenarios. Interest rate sensitivity depends on certain repricing characteristics in our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, including the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during the periods of changes in market interest rates. The analysis presented below assumes a constant balance sheet. Actual results would differ from the assumptions used in this model, as management monitors and adjusts loan and deposit pricing and the size and composition of the balance sheet to respond to changing interest rates.\nIn the event of an immediate and parallel increase of 200 basis points in both short- and long-term interest rates, the model estimates that net interest income would increase by 1.9% in the next year. This compares to an estimated increase of 9.7% as of the September 30, 2021 analysis. It is noted that a flattening yield curve where the spread between short-term rates and long-term rates decreases would likely result in lower net interest income and vice versa for a steepening yield curve. Management estimates that a gradual increase of 300 basis points in short-term rates and 100 basis points in long-term rates over two years would result in a 0.5% increase in net interest income in the first year and an increase of 1.8% in the second year, assuming a constant balance sheet and no management intervention.\nNet Portfolio Value (\"NPV\") Sensitivity. The NPV is an estimate of the market value of shareholders' equity at a point in time. It is derived by calculating the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and the present value of expected cash flows from liabilities and off-balance-sheet contracts. The sensitivity of the NPV to changes in interest rates provides a longer term view of interest rate risk of the current balance sheet as it incorporates all future expected cash flows. As of September 30, 2022, in the event of an immediate and parallel increase of 200 basis points in interest rates, the NPV is estimated to decrease by $617,000,000, or 20.9%, and the NPV-to-total assets ratio to decline to 12.6% from a base of 14.9%. As of September 30, 2021, in the event of an immediate and parallel increase of 200 basis points in interest rates, the NPV was estimated to decrease by $207,000,000, or 6.8%, and the NPV-to-total assets ratio to decline to 15.2% from a base of 15.5%. The change in the sensitivity of the NPV ratio to this assumed change in interest rates is primarily due to the flattening of the yield curve and changes in balance sheet mix year over year.\nInterest Rate Spread. The interest rate spread is measured as the difference between the rate on interest-earning assets and the rate on interest-bearing liabilities at the end of each period. The period end interest rate spread was 3.36% at September 30, 2022 and 2.45% at September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2022, the weighted-average rate on interest-earning assets increased by 124 basis points to 4.04% compared to September 30, 2021. The higher rate on interest-earning assets is due primarily to the Federal Reserve Bank's rate increases which have led to higher rates on adjustable rate loans, investment securities and cash as well as asset mix shifting to loans receivable. As of September 30, 2022, the weighted-average rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 33 basis points to 0.68% compared to September 30, 2021. The higher rate on interest-bearing liabilities primarily resulted from customer deposits repricing and a higher rate on new FHLB borrowings. The period end interest rate spread for the last eight fiscal quarters is shown below:\nSEP 2022 JUN 2022 MAR 2022 DEC 2021 SEP 2021 JUN 2021 MAR 2021 DEC 2020\nInterest rate on loans and mortgage-backed securities 4.13 % 3.67 % 3.37 % 3.30 % 3.37 % 3.30 % 3.38 % 3.48 %\nInterest rate on other interest-earning assets 3.16 2.02 0.85 0.67 0.53 0.58 0.54 0.64\nCombined, all interest-earning assets 4.04 3.50 2.93 2.83 2.80 2.72 2.75 2.92\nInterest rate on customer accounts 0.51 0.32 0.24 0.23 0.23 0.24 0.25 0.36\nInterest rate on borrowings (1) 2.02 1.43 1.55 1.49 1.51 1.74 1.84 1.82\nCombined cost of funds 0.68 0.43 0.36 0.35 0.35 0.41 0.45 0.58\nInterest rate spread 3.36 % 3.07 % 2.57 % 2.48 % 2.45 % 2.31 % 2.30 % 2.34 %\n(1) Represents the effective rate taking into consideration cash flow hedges on FHLB borrowings.\nThe chart below shows the volatility of our period end net interest spread (dashed line measured against the right axis) compared to the relatively consistent growth in net interest income (solid line measured against the left axis). The relative consistency of net interest income is accomplished by actively managing the size and composition of the balance sheet through different rate cycles.\nNet Interest Margin. The net interest margin is measured using net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets for the period. The net interest margin increased to 3.16% for the year ended September 30, 2022, from 2.80% for the year\nended September 30, 2021. The yield on interest-earning assets increased 26 basis points to 3.54% and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 11 basis points to 0.50%. The higher yield on interest-earning assets was primarily due to the impact of rising rates on adjustable rate assets and cash. Amortization of net loan origination fees on PPP loans declined to $6,536,000 during the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $10,291,000 in the prior year. The lower rate in interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to replacing high-yielding, long-term FHLB borrowings with new borrowings at lower rates.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, average interest-earning assets increased by 4.3% to $18,812,481,000, up from $18,036,174,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021. The substantial balance sheet growth in 2022 was primarily due to the growth in loans receivable. During 2022, average loans receivable increased $1,873,469,000, or 14.2%, while the combined average balances of mortgage-backed securities, other investment securities and cash decreased by $1,061,655,000 or 22.6%. Management views organic loan growth as the highest and best use of capital; thus the focus on primarily growing loans receivable.\nDuring 2022, average interest-bearing customer deposit accounts increased $775,955,000 or 6.5% and the average balance of FHLB borrowings decreased by $502,917,000, or 22.5%, from 2021.\nThe following table sets forth the information explaining the changes in the net interest income and net interest margin.\nNet Interest Income Summary\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nAverage\nBalance Interest Average\nRate Average\nBalance Interest Average\nRate Average\nBalance Interest Average\nRate\n($ in thousands)\nAssets\nLoans receivable (1) $ 15,083,111 $ 601,593 3.99 % $ 13,209,642 $ 537,660 4.07 % $ 12,266,430 $ 545,708 4.44 %\nMortgage-backed securities 1,141,501 26,332 2.31 1,290,901 24,707 1.91 2,060,804 49,312 2.39\nCash and other investment securities (2) 2,500,008 33,555 1.34 3,412,263 23,051 0.68 1,587,602 20,112 1.26\nFHLB & FRB stock 87,861 4,879 5.55 123,368 6,192 5.02 135,294 6,133 4.52\nTotal interest-earning assets 18,812,481 666,359 3.54 % 18,036,174 591,610 3.28 % 16,050,130 621,265 3.86 %\nOther assets 1,343,848 1,279,085 1,254,061\nTotal assets $ 20,156,329 $ 19,315,259 $ 17,304,191\nLiabilities and Shareholders Equity\nInterest-bearing customer accounts $ 12,738,719 43,041 0.34 % $ 11,962,764 42,312 0.35 % $ 10,647,044 100,312 0.94 %\nFHLB advances 1,731,110 28,729 1.66 2,234,027 44,188 1.98 2,532,596 51,445 2.03\nOther borrowings 10 - 2.49 11 - 0.69 19 - 0.46\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 14,469,839 71,770 0.50 % 14,196,802 86,500 0.61 % 13,179,659 151,757 1.15 %\nNoninterest-bearing customer accounts 3,249,120 2,679,773 1,870,032\nOther liabilities 245,213 249,134 244,203\nTotal liabilities 17,964,172 17,125,709 15,293,894\nShareholders equity 2,195,157 2,189,550 2,010,297\nTotal liabilities and shareholders equity $ 20,159,329 $ 19,315,259 $ 17,304,191\nNet interest income/interest rate spread $ 594,589 3.04 % $ 505,110 2.67 % $ 469,508 2.71 %\nNet interest margin (3) 3.16 % 2.80 % 2.93 %\n___________________\n(1)Interest income includes net amortization-accretion of deferred loan fees, costs, discounts and premiums of $29,156,000, $48,079,000 and $25,060,000 for year ended 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(2)Includes cash equivalents and non-mortgage backed security investments, such as U.S. agency obligations, mutual funds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds.\n(3)Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.\nThe following table shows the potential impact of rising interest rates on net income for one year. The Company's focus is primarily on the impact of abrupt upward or downward changes in short term rates. It is important to note that this is not a forecast or prediction of future events, but is used as a tool for measuring potential risk. This analysis assumes zero balance sheet growth and a constant percentage composition of assets and liabilities.\nPotential Increase (Decrease) in Net Interest Income\nBasis Point Increase (Decrease) in Interest Rates September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\n(In thousands, except percentages)\n(200) $ (18,501) (2.40) % N/A N/A\n(100) (10,525) (1.37) N/A N/A\n100 4,788 0.62 $ 24,612 4.76 %\n200 14,381 1.87 50,065 9.67\n300 21,110 2.74 72,721 14.05\nActual results will differ from the assumptions used in this model, as management monitors and adjusts both the size and the composition of the balance sheet in order to respond to changing interest rates. In a rising interest rate environment, it is likely that the Company will grow its balance sheet to offset margin compression that may occur. Improvement in the net interest income sensitivity during the year is primarily the result of interest rate swap activity and extension of the maturity of certain borrowings.\nAnother method used to quantify interest rate risk is the NPV analysis. This analysis calculates the difference between the present value of interest-bearing liabilities and the present value of expected cash flows from interest-earning assets and off-balance-sheet contracts. The following tables set forth an analysis of the Companys interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in NPV resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve (measured in 100-basis-point increments).\nThe tables below express the NPV under varying interest scenarios.\nSeptember 30, 2022\nChange in\nInterest Rates Estimated\nNPV Amount Estimated Increase/(Decrease) in NPV Amount NPV as\n% of Assets\n(Basis Points) (In thousands) (In thousands)\n300 $ 1,987,904 $ (956,559) 11.06 %\n200 2,327,875 (616,588) 12.57\n100 2,647,946 (296,517) 13.86\nNo change 2,944,463 - 14.93\nSeptember 30, 2021\nChange in\nInterest Rates Estimated\nNPV Amount Estimated Increase/(Decrease) in NPV Amount NPV as\n% of Assets\n(Basis Points) (In thousands) (In thousands)\n300 $ 2,705,037 $ (353,315) 14.88 %\n200 2,851,010 (207,342) 15.24\n100 2,973,814 (84,538) 15.45\nNo change 3,058,352 - 15.46\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all of its interest rate risk policy guidelines.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022, and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 18, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAllowance for Loan Losses - Refer to Notes A and E to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nEstimates of expected credit losses on loans under the current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology required under Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification No. 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (\"ASC 326\") are based on relevant information about current conditions, past events, and reasonable and supportable forward-looking forecasts regarding collectability of the reported amounts. In order to estimate the allowance for loan losses (\"ALL\"), the Company used either a cohort or weighted average remaining maturities (WARM) methodology to determine the historical loss rate, by loan portfolio class, then considered whether qualitative adjustments to those historical loss rates were warranted. As of September 30, 2022, the ALL was $172,808,000.\nSignificant management judgments are required in determining whether, and to what extent, qualitative adjustments for each portfolio loan class are required. These adjustments are made after considering the conditions over the period from which historical loss experience was based and are split into two components: 1) asset or class specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date related to portfolio credit quality, remaining payments, volume and nature, credit culture and management, business\nenvironment or other management factors, not captured in the historical loss rates and 2) reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and collateral values.\nGiven the significance of the ALL, reliance on historical loss rates and the management judgments required for quantitative and qualitative evaluation of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts, performing audit procedures to evaluate the ALL requires a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of effort.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the ALL, included the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of managements controls over (1) key assumptions and judgments, (2) the CECL estimation model for loan portfolios, (3) the qualitative adjustments determined by management including the reasonable and supportable forecast adjustment selected by management, (4) and disclosures.\nWe evaluated the appropriateness of the Companys accounting policies, assumptions, and elections involved in the application of the CECL methodology.\nWe tested the underlying data and mathematical accuracy of the cohort and WARM methodologies used to determine the loan portfolio class historical loss rates.\nWe evaluated the reasonableness and conceptual soundness of the methodologies, as applied in the CECL estimation models, including key assumptions and judgments in estimating expected credit losses.\nWe evaluated the accuracy and completeness of the Companys disclosures in accordance with ASC 326.\nSpecific to the qualitative adjustments made to the historical loss rates:\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the framework for the qualitative adjustments.\nWe performed analysis to evaluate the relevance of each of the reasonable and supportable forecast assumptions to historic losses.\nWe evaluated managements reasonable and supportable forecast of economic variables by comparing forecasts to relevant external market data.\nWe assessed managements determination whether, and to what extent, a qualitative adjustment was warranted to certain loan portfolio classes to account for specific risk characteristics or current conditions that differ from the period over which the historical loss rate was determined.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nNovember 18, 2022\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since at least 1982; however, an earlier year could not be reliably determined.\nWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC.

Washington Federal Bank, a federally-insured Washington state chartered commercial bank dba WaFd Bank (the Bank or WaFd Bank), was founded on April 24, 1917 in Ballard, Washington and is engaged primarily in providing lending, depository, insurance and other banking services to consumers, mid-sized to large businesses, and owners and developers of commercial real estate. Washington Federal, Inc., a Washington corporation was formed as the Banks holding company in November, 1994. As used throughout this document, the terms Washington Federal, the Company or \"we\" or \"us\" and \"our\" refer to the Washington Federal, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, and the term Bank refers to the operating subsidiary, Washington Federal Bank. The Company is headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The Bank conducts its activities through a network of 201 bank branches located in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas.\nBasis of presentation and use of estimates. The Companys accounting and financial reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). Inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and related disclosures. The areas that require application of significant management judgments often result in the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain amounts in the financial statements from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation. In certain instances, amounts in text are presented by rounding to the nearest thousand.\nThe Company's fiscal year end is September 30. All references to 2022, 2021 and 2020 represent balances as of September 30, 2022, September 30, 2021, and September 30, 2020, or activity for the fiscal years then ended.\nPreferred stock. On February 8, 2021, in connection with an underwritten public offering, the Company issued 300,000 shares of 4.875% Noncumulative Perpetual Series A Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred Stock). Net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and expenses, were $293,325,000. The public offering consisted of the issuance and sale of 12,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of the Series A Preferred Stock, at a public offering price of $25.00 per depositary share. Holders of the depositary shares are entitled to all proportional rights and preferences of the Series A Preferred Stock (including, dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). The depositary shares are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \"WAFDP.\" The Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at the option of the Company, subject to all applicable regulatory approvals, on or after April 15, 2026.\nCash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, overnight investments and repurchase agreements with an initial maturity of three months or less.\nRestricted cash balances - Based on the level of vault cash on hand, the Company was not required to maintain cash reserve balances with the Federal Reserve Bank as of September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, the Company held counterparty cash collateral of $284,400,000 and pledged cash collateral of $1,500,000, respectively, related to derivative contracts.\nEquity securities - The Company records equity securities within Other assets in its Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. These equity investments are accounted for under different methods.\nLow-income housing tax credit investments are accounted for under the proportional amortization method in accordance with ASU 2014-1.\nFor other equity investments where the Company has significant influence, the Company applies the equity method of accounting, which adjusts the carrying value of the investment to recognize a proportionate share of the financial results of the investment entity, regardless of whether any distribution is made. Any adjustments to the fair value of these investments are recorded in Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFor other equity investments where neither ASU 2014-1 nor the equity method of accounting is applicable, the Company applies the fair value adjustment method of ASU 2016-1. Any adjustments to the fair value of these investments are recorded in Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fair value is determined by reference to readily determinable market values if applicable. Equity investments that do not have readily determinable\nWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022, 2021, AND 2020\nfair values (non-marketable) are generally accounted for at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable transactions involving the same or similar investments from the same issuer, also referred to as the measurement alternative. Under the NAV expedient for fair value measurement, equity investments in qualified real estate funds can use the net asset value (NAV) determined by the fund as fair value for the investment. At September 30, 2022, equity investments held by the Company and recorded at NAV had a carrying amount of $41,476,000 and a remaining unfunded commitment of $7,511,000. These NAV based investments cannot be transferred without consent and we do not have redemption rights. Equity investments measured at NAV are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.\nDebt securities, including mortgage-backed securities. The Company accounts for debt securities in two categories: held-to-maturity and available-for-sale. Premiums and discounts on debt securities are deferred and recognized into income over the contractual life of the asset using the effective interest method.\nHeld-to-maturity securities are accounted for at amortized cost, but the Company must have both the positive intent and the ability to hold those securities to maturity. There are very limited circumstances under which securities in the held-to-maturity category can be sold without jeopardizing the cost basis of accounting for the remainder of the securities in this category.\nAvailable-for-sale securities are accounted for at fair value. Gains and losses realized on the sale of these securities are accounted for based on the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported net of the related tax effect in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders' equity.\nAllowance for Credit Losses (Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities). For held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities, the Company is required to utilize a CECL methodology to estimate expected credit losses. Substantially all of the Companys HTM debt securities are issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss. Therefore, the Company did not record an allowance for credit losses for these securities. As September 30, 2022, the Company determined that the expected credit loss on its corporate and municipal bonds was immaterial, and therefore, an allowance for credit losses was not recorded. See Note C \"Investment Securities\" and Note F \"Fair Value Measurements\" for more information about HTM debt securities.\nAllowance for Credit Losses (Available-for-Sale Debt Securities). The impairment model for available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities differs from the CECL methodology applied for HTM debt securities because AFS debt securities are measured at fair value rather than amortized cost. Although ASC 326 replaced the legacy other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) model with a credit loss model, it retained the fundamental nature of the legacy OTTI model. For AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either criteria is met, the securitys amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For AFS debt securities where neither of the criteria are met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the credit rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited to the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any remaining discount that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Under the new guidance, an entity may no longer consider the length of time fair value has been less than amortized cost. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as a provision (or release) for credit losses. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of an AFS security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. As of September 30, 2022, the Company determined that the unrealized loss positions in AFS securities were not the result of credit losses, and therefore, an allowance for credit losses was not recorded. See Note C \"Investment Securities\" and Note F \"Fair Value Measurements\" for more information about AFS debt securities.\nLoans receivable. Loans that are performing in accordance with their contractual terms are carried at the unpaid principal balance, net of premiums, discounts and net deferred loan fees. Net deferred loan fees include nonrefundable loan origination\nWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022, 2021, AND 2020\nfees less direct loan origination costs. Net deferred loan fees, premiums and discounts are amortized into interest income using either the interest method or straight-line method over the terms of the loans, adjusted for actual prepayments. In addition to fees and costs for originating loans, various other fees and charges related to existing loans may occur, including prepayment charges, late charges and assumption fees.\nWhen a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan, the Bank attempts to cure the deficiency by contacting the borrower. Contact is made after a payment is 30 days past its grace period. In most cases, deficiencies are cured promptly. If the delinquency is not cured within 90 days, the Bank may institute appropriate action to foreclose on the property. If foreclosed, the property is sold at a public sale and may be purchased by the Bank.\nAllowance for Credit Losses (Loans Receivable). The Company applies FASB ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (\"ASC 326\"), so the allowance calculation is based on current expected credit loss methodology (\"CECL\"). The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses (ACL) for the expected credit losses of the loan portfolio as well as unfunded loan commitments. The amount of ACL is based on ongoing, quarterly assessments by management. The CECL methodology requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures) and replaces the incurred loss methodologys threshold that delayed the recognition of a credit loss until it was probable a loss event was incurred. See Note E \"Allowance for Losses on Loans\" for details.\nThe ACL consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded commitments. The estimate of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Historical loss experience is generally the starting point for estimating expected credit losses. We then consider whether the historical loss experience should be adjusted for asset-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date that did not exist over the period that historical experience was based for each loan type. Finally, we consider forecasts about future economic conditions or changes in collateral values that are reasonable and supportable.\nPortfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine its ACL. The Company has designated two loan portfolio segments, commercial loans and consumer loans. These loan portfolio segments are further disaggregated into classes, which represent loans of similar type, risk characteristics, and methods for monitoring and assessing credit risk. The commercial loan portfolio segment is disaggregated into five classes: multi-family, commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, construction, and land acquisition and development. The risk of loss for the commercial loan portfolio segment is generally most indicated by the credit risk rating assigned to each borrower. Commercial loan risk ratings are determined by experienced senior credit officers based on specific facts and circumstances and are subject to periodic review by an independent internal team of credit specialists. The consumer loan portfolio segment is disaggregated into five classes: single-family-residential mortgage, custom construction, consumer lot loans, home equity lines of credit, and other consumer. The risk of loss for the consumer loan portfolio segment is generally most indicated by delinquency status and general economic factors. Each commercial and consumer loan portfolio class may also be further segmented based on risk characteristics.\nFor most of our loan portfolio classes, the historical loss experience is determined using a cohort methodology. This method pools loans into groups (cohorts) sharing similar risk characteristics and tracks each cohorts net charge-offs over the lives of the loans to calculate a historical loss rate. The historical loss rates for each cohort are then averaged to calculate an overall historical loss rate which is applied to the current loan balance to arrive at the quantitative baseline portion of the allowance for credit losses for the respective loan portfolio class. For certain loan portfolio classes, the Company determined there was not sufficient historical loss information to calculate a meaningful historical loss rate using the cohort methodology. For any such loan portfolio class, the weighted-average remaining maturity (WARM) methodology is being utilized until sufficient historical loss data is obtained. The WARM method multiplies an average annual loss rate by the expected remaining life of the loan pool to arrive at the quantitative baseline portion of the allowance for credit losses for the respective loan portfolio class.\nThe Company also considers qualitative adjustments to the historical loss rate for each loan portfolio class. The qualitative adjustments for each loan class consider the conditions over the period from which historical loss experience was based and are split into two components: 1) asset or class specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date related to portfolio credit quality, remaining payments, volume and nature, credit culture and management, business environment or other management factors and 2) reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic conditions and collateral values.\nWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022, 2021, AND 2020\nThe Company performs a quarterly asset quality review which includes a review of forecasted gross charge-offs and recoveries, nonperforming assets, criticized loans, risk rating migration, delinquencies, etc. The asset quality review is performed by management and the results are used to consider a qualitative overlay to the quantitative baseline. The second qualitative adjustment noted above, economic conditions and collateral values, encompasses a one-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. The overlay adjustment for the reasonable and supportable forecast assumes an immediate reversion after the one-year forecast period to historical loss rates for the remaining life of the respective loan pool.\nWhen management deems it to be appropriate, the Company establishes a specific reserve for individually evaluated loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the loans included in each respective loan pool. These individually evaluated loans are removed from their respective pools and typically represent collateral dependent loans but may also include other non-performing loans or troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). In addition, the Company individually evaluates reasonably expected TDRs, which are identified by the Company as a loan expected to be classified as a TDR within the next six months. Management judgment is utilized to make this determination.\nTroubled debt restructured loans (\"TDRs\"). The Company will consider modifying the interest rates and terms of a loan if it determines that a modification is a better alternative to foreclosure. Most TDRs are accruing and performing loans where the borrower has proactively approached the Company about modifications due to temporary financial difficulties. Each request is individually evaluated for merit and likelihood of success. The concession for these loans is typically a payment reduction through a rate reduction of 100 to 200 bps for a specific term, usually six to 12 months. Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period. Principal forgiveness is generally not an available option for restructured loans. Before granting approval to modify a loan in a TDR, the borrowers ability to repay is evaluated, including: current income levels and debt to income ratio, borrowers credit score, payment history of the loan and updated evaluation of the secondary repayment source. The Company also modifies some loans that are not classified as TDRs as the modification is due to a restructuring where the effective interest rate on the debt is reduced to reflect a decrease in market interest rates. The Company's ACL reflects the effects of a TDR when management reasonably expects at the reporting date that a TDR will be executed with an individual borrower.\nNon-accrual loans. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in the judgment of management, the probability of collection of interest is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income. The Company does not accrue interest on loans 90 days or more past due. If payment is made on a loan so that the loan becomes less than 90 days past due, and the Company expects full collection of principal and interest, the loan is returned to full accrual status. Any interest ultimately collected is credited to income in the period of recovery. A loan is charged-off when the loss is estimable and it is confirmed that the borrower is not expected to be able to meet contractual obligations.\nIf a consumer loan is on non-accrual status before becoming a TDR it will stay on non-accrual status following restructuring until it has been performing for at least six months, at which point it may be moved to accrual status. If a loan is on accrual status before it becomes a TDR, and management concludes that full repayment is probable based on internal evaluation, it will remain on accrual status following restructuring. If the restructured consumer loan does not perform, it is placed on non-accrual status when it is 90 days delinquent. For commercial loans, six consecutive payments on newly restructured loan terms are required prior to returning the loan to accrual status. In some instances, after the required six consecutive payments are made, management will conclude that collection of the entire principal and interest due is still in doubt. In those instances, the loan will remain on non-accrual status.\nAccrued interest receivable. The Company has made the following elections regarding accrued interest receivable (\"AIR\"):\nPresenting accrued interest receivable balances separately from their underlying instruments within the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nExcluding accrued interest receivable that is included in the amortized cost of financing receivables from related disclosure requirements.\nContinuing our policy to write off accrued interest receivable by reversing interest income in cases where the Company does not reasonably expect to receive payment.\nNot measuring an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivable due to the Companys policy of writing off uncollectible accrued interest receivable balances in a timely manner. We believe accrued interest receivable recorded as of September 30, 2022 is collectible.\nWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022, 2021, AND 2020\nOff-balance-sheet credit exposures. The only material off-balance-sheet credit exposures are loans in process and unused lines of credit. The reserve for unfunded commitments is recognized as a liability (other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition), with adjustments to the reserve recognized through provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income. The reserve for unfunded commitments represents the expected lifetime credit losses on off-balance sheet obligations such as commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. However, a liability is not recognized for commitments that are unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The reserve for unfunded commitments is determined by estimating future draws, including the effects of risk mitigation actions, and applying the expected loss rates on those draws. Loss rates are estimated by utilizing the same loss rates calculated for the allowance for credit losses related to the respective loan portfolio class. See Note M \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for details.\nClient swap program hedges. Interest rate swap agreements are provided to certain clients who desire to convert their obligations from variable to fixed interest rates. Under these agreements, the Bank enters into a variable-rate loan agreement with a customer in addition to a swap agreement, and then enters into a corresponding swap agreement with a third party in order to offset its exposure on the customer swap agreement. As the interest rate swap agreements with the customers and third parties are not designated as accounting hedges under FASB ASC 815, the instruments are marked to market in earnings. The change in fair value of the offsetting swaps are included in other noninterest income and there is no impact on net income. There is fee income earned on the swaps that is included in loan fee income.\nBorrowings cash flow hedges. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert a series of future short-term borrowings to fixed-rate payments. These interest rate swaps qualify as cash flow hedging instruments under ASC 815 so gains and losses are recorded in Other Comprehensive Income to the extent the hedge is effective. Gains and losses on the interest rate swaps are reclassified from OCI to earnings in the period the hedged transaction affects earnings and are included in the same income statement line item that the hedged transaction is recorded.\nMortgage loan \"last-of-layer\" portfolio hedges. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the portion of the respective closed portfolios of prepayable mortgage loans that are expected to remain at the end of the hedge term. These hedges qualify as last-of-layer hedges under ASC 815 and provide for matching of the recognition of the gains and losses on the interest rate swap and the related hedged item.\nCommercial loan fair value hedges. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge long term fixed rate commercial loans. These hedges qualify as fair value hedges under ASC 815 and provide for matching of the recognition of the gains and losses on the interest rate swap and the related hedged loan.\nPremises and equipment. Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Costs for improvements are capitalized. Charges for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred.\nReal estate owned. Real estate properties acquired through foreclosure of loans or through acquisitions are recorded initially at fair value less selling costs and are subsequently recorded at lower of cost or fair value. Costs for improvements are capitalized. Any gains (losses) and maintenance costs are recorded in Gain (loss) on real estate owned, net.\nIntangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Other intangibles, including core deposit intangibles, are acquired assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated lives and are subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances change. If circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, an impairment charge could be recorded. The Bank amortizes the core deposit intangibles over their estimated lives using an accelerated method.\nWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022, 2021, AND 2020\nThe table below provides detail regarding the Company's intangible assets.\nGoodwill Core Deposit and Other Intangibles Total\n(In thousands)\nBalance at September 30, 2020 $ 302,707 $ 7,199 $ 309,906\nAdditions 750 750 1,500\nAmortization - (1,387) (1,387)\nBalance at September 30, 2021 303,457 6,562 310,019\nAdditions - - -\nAmortization - (1,010) (1,010)\nBalance at September 30, 2022 $ 303,457 $ 5,552 $ 309,009\nThe table below presents the estimated future amortization expense of core deposit and other intangibles for the next five years.\nFiscal Year Expense\n(In thousands)\n2023 $ 955\n2024 921\n2025 872\n2026 829\n2027 654\nIncome taxes. Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and corresponding tax treatment of income, gains, losses, deductions or credits using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The provision for income taxes includes current and deferred income tax expense based on net income adjusted for temporary and permanent differences such as depreciation, loan loss reserve, tax-exempt interest, and affordable housing tax credits. Reserves for uncertain tax positions, together with any related interest and penalties, if applicable, and amortization of affordable housing tax credit investments are recorded within income tax expense.\nAccounting for stock-based compensation. We recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based forms of compensation issued to employees over the employees' requisite service period (generally the vesting period). The requisite service period may be subject to performance conditions. Stock options and restricted stock awards generally vest ratably over two to five years and are recognized as expense over that same period of time. The exercise price of each option equals the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant, and the maximum term is ten years.\nCertain grants of restricted stock are subject to performance-based and market-based vesting as well as other approved vesting conditions and cliff vest based on those conditions. Compensation expense is recognized over the service period to the extent restricted stock awards are expected to vest. See Note P \"Stock Award Plans\" for additional information.\nBusiness segments. As the Company manages its business and operations on a consolidated basis, management has determined that there is one reportable business segment.\nRegulatory matters. The Bank was previously subject to a Consent Order from the OCC for its BSA program that was issued in February 2018 (the BSA Consent Order). The BSA Consent Order resulted in the Bank incurring significant expenses to\nWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022, 2021, AND 2020\ncomply with it, including payment of a $2,500,000 civil money penalty. The OCC terminated the BSA Consent Order in December 2021.\nOn October 9, 2013, the CFPB entered a Consent Order against the Bank that required the Bank to pay a civil money penalty of $34,000, and to adopt an enhanced compliance program related to reporting Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (\"HMDA\") data. The Bank has adopted an enhanced HMDA program, which continues to be subject to review by the CFPB. On October 27, 2020 the CFPB entered a second Consent Order against the Bank for violations related to the Banks HMDA reporting obligations. The 2020 Consent Order required the Bank to pay a $200,000 civil money penalty and develop and implement a HMDA compliance management system. Both HMDA Consent Orders remain in place.\nSubsequent events. On November 13, 2022, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which it will acquire Luther Burbank Corporation (NASDAQ: LBC, Luther Burbank) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Luther Burbank Savings, in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $654 million based upon the closing price of Washington Federals common stock on November 11, 2022. Upon closing of the transaction, which was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of each of Washington Federal and Luther Burbank, and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, Luther Burbank shareholders will be entitled to receive 0.3353 shares of Washington Federal common stock for each share of Luther Burbank common stock they own. The transaction, which is anticipated to close as early as the second calendar quarter of 2023, will expand Washington Federals franchise into California. The Company has evaluated subsequent events for adjustment to or disclosure in the Companys consolidated financial statements through the date of this report and has not identified any other recordable or disclosable events.\nNOTE B - NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848). The amendments in this ASU provide temporary, optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The ASU primarily includes relief related to contract modifications and hedging relationships, as well as providing a one-time election for the sale or transfer of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity. This guidance is effective immediately and the amendments may be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. The Company has evaluated the regulatory requirements to cease the use of LIBOR and has put in place systems and capabilities for this purpose. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). The amendments in this ASU clarify the guidance on ASC 815 on fair value hedge accounting of interest rate risk for portfolios and financial assets. Among other things, the amended guidance establishes the \"last-of-layer\" method for making the fair value hedge accounting for these portfolios more accessible and renames that method the \"portfolio layer\" method. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect the amendments to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). The amendments in this ASU eliminate the guidance on troubled debt restructurings while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. The ASU also requires that entities disclose current-period gross charge-offs by year of origination for loans and leases. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect the amendments to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC.

Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) passed by Congress, these loan modifications are not accounted for as TDRs. In total, 1,472 consumer loans and 221 commercial loans were approved for deferrals. As of September 30, 2022, 1 mortgage loan\nWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022, 2021, AND 2020\ntotaling $64,000 and no commercial loans that had been modified remain in deferral. These loans are not considered past due until after the deferral period is over and scheduled payments have resumed.\nThe Company participated in the Small Business Administrations Paycheck Protection Program. This program came about through the CARES Act to help small businesses keep their employees employed through the COVID-19 shelter in place orders. The Company assisted over 9,000 businesses with approximately $1,085,000,000 in PPP loan originations. As of September 30, 2022, approximately 8,800 PPP loans totaling $1,075,000,000 have been forgiven by the SBA and we continued to hold PPP loans receivable with an amortized cost of $10,141,000.\nMost TDRs are accruing and performing loans where the borrower has proactively approached the Company about modifications due to temporary financial difficulties. Each request is individually evaluated for merit and likelihood of success. The concession for these loans is typically a payment reduction through a rate reduction of 100 to 200 bps for a specific term, usually six to 12 months. Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period. Principal forgiveness is not an available option for restructured loans. As of September 30, 2022, the outstanding balance of TDRs was $56,817,000 as compared to $65,128,000 as of September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2022, 98.3% of the restructured loans were performing. Single-family residential loans comprised 82.5% of TDRs as of September 30, 2022. The Company's ACL methodology takes into account the following performance indicators for restructured loans: 1) time since modification, 2) current payment status and 3) geographic area.\nWe evaluate the credit quality of our commercial loans based on regulatory risk ratings and also consider other factors. Based on this evaluation, the loans are assigned a grade and classified as follows:\nPass - the credit does not meet one of the definitions below.\nSpecial mention - A special mention credit is considered to be currently protected from loss but is potentially weak. No loss of principal or interest is foreseen; however, proper supervision and management attention is required to deter further deterioration in the credit. Assets in this category constitute some undue and unwarranted credit risk but not to the point of justifying a risk rating of substandard. The credit risk may be relatively minor yet constitutes an unwarranted risk in light of the circumstances surrounding a specific asset.\nSubstandard - A substandard credit is an unacceptable credit. Additionally, repayment in the normal course is in jeopardy due to the existence of one or more well defined weaknesses. In these situations, loss of principal is likely if the weakness is not corrected. A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified will have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the collection or liquidation of the debt. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets risk rated substandard.\nDoubtful - A credit classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. The probability of loss is high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors that may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include proposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation procedures, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, and refinancing plans.\nLoss - Credits classified loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. Losses should be taken in the period in which they are identified as uncollectible. Partial charge-off versus full charge-off may be taken if the collateral offers some identifiable protection.\nWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022, 2021, AND 2020\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $3,000,000 in 2022, compared to a provision of $500,000 for 2021. In 2022, provisioning for net growth in the loan portfolio was mostly offset by improvements in the credit quality of certain loan portfolios related to strong real estate markets and collateral conditions. For the year ended September 30, 2022, net recoveries were $3,508,000, compared to $6,345,000 in the prior year. A loan is charged-off when the loss is estimable and it is confirmed that the borrower is not expected to be able to meet its contractual obligations. No allowance was recorded as of September 30, 2022 or September 30, 2021 for the PPP loans, which are included in the commercial & industrial loan category, due to the government guarantee.\nNon-accrual loans increased to $34,534,000 as of September 30, 2022, from $31,749,000 as of September 30, 2021. Non-performing assets totaled $44,554,000, or 0.21% of total assets, at September 30, 2022, compared to $43,625,000, or 0.22% of total assets, as of September 30, 2021.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the allowance for loan losses of $172,808,000 is for loans that are evaluated on a pooled basis, which was comprised of $115,245,000 related to the quantitative component and $57,563,000 related to management's qualitative overlays (including the forecast component of the reserve).\nThe Company has an asset quality review function that analyzes its loan portfolio and reports the results of the review to its Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The single-family residential, HELOC and consumer portfolios are evaluated based on their performance as a pool of loans, since no single loan is individually significant or judged by its risk rating, size or potential risk of loss. The construction, land, multi-family, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans are risk rated on a loan by loan basis to determine the relative risk inherent in specific borrowers or loans.

ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active exchange markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.\nLevel 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a companys own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe Company has established and documented the process for determining the fair values of its assets and liabilities, where applicable. Fair value is based on quoted market prices, when available, for identical or similar assets or liabilities. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value is determined using valuation models or third-party appraisals. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to measure and report the fair value of financial assets and liabilities on a recurring or nonrecurring basis.\nMeasured on a Recurring Basis\nAvailable-for-sale investment securities and derivative contracts\nSecurities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of debt securities are priced using model pricing based on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted prices as provided by an independent third party, and under GAAP are considered a Level 2 input method. Securities that are traded on active exchanges, including the Company's equity securities, are measured using the closing price in an active market and are considered a Level 1 input method.\nThe Company offers interest rate swaps to its variable rate borrowers who want to manage their interest rate risk. At the same time, the Company enters into the opposite trade with a counter party to offset its interest rate risk. The Company has also entered various forms of fair value hedges and cash flow hedges using interest rate swaps. The fair value of these interest rate swaps are estimated by a third party pricing service using a discounted cash flow technique. These are considered a Level 2 input method.\nWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC.

REO consists principally of properties acquired through foreclosure. From time to time, and on a nonrecurring basis, adjustments using fair value measurements are recorded to reflect increases or decreases based on the discounted cash flows, the current appraisal or estimated value of the collateral or REO property.\nWhen management determines that the fair value of the collateral or the REO requires additional adjustments, either as a result of an updated appraised value or when there is no observable market price, the Company classifies the collateral dependent loan or real estate owned as Level 3. Level 3 assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis includes loans for which an allowance was established or a partial charge-off was recorded based on the fair value of collateral, as well as real estate owned where the fair value of the property was less than the cost basis.\nThe following tables present the aggregated balance of assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis for the periods presented, and the total gains (losses) resulting from those fair value adjustments during the respective periods.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022, 2021, AND 2020\nLoans receivable - Fair values are estimated first by stratifying the portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type such as multi-family real estate, residential mortgage, construction, commercial, consumer and land loans. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed- and adjustable-rate interest terms. For residential mortgages and multi-family loans, the bank determined that its best exit price was by securitization. MBS benchmark prices are used as a base price, with further loan level pricing adjustments made based on individual loan characteristics such as FICO score, LTV, Property Type and occupancy. For all other loan categories an estimate of fair value is then calculated based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate offered and observed in the market on similar products, plus an adjustment for liquidity to reflect the non-homogeneous nature of the loans, as well as, an annual loss rate based on historical losses to arrive at an estimated exit price fair value. Fair value for impaired loans is also based on recent appraisals or estimated cash flows discounted using rates commensurate with risk associated with the estimated cash flows. Assumptions regarding credit risk, cash flows and discount rates are judgmentally determined using available market information and specific borrower information.\nFHLB and FRB stock - The fair value is based upon the par value of the stock which equates to its carrying value.\nTime deposits - The fair value of fixed-maturity time deposits is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using the rates currently offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities.\nFHLB advances - The fair value of FHLB advances and other borrowings is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar remaining maturities.\nInterest rate swaps - The Company offers interest rate swaps to its variable rate borrowers who want to manage their interest rate risk. At the same time, the Bank enters into the opposite trade with a counterparty to offset its interest rate risk. The Company also uses interest rate swaps for various fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. The fair value of interest rate swaps are estimated by a third-party pricing service using a discounted cash flow technique.\nNOTE G - DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nThe following tables present the fair value, notional amount and balance sheet classification of derivative assets and liabilities at September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.\nSeptember 30, 2022 Derivative Assets Derivative Liabilities\nInterest rate contract purpose Balance Sheet Location Notional Fair Value Balance Sheet Location Notional Fair Value\n(In thousands) (In thousands)\nClient swap program hedges Other assets $ 588,676 $ 67,260 Other liabilities $ 588,676 $ 67,260\nCommercial loan fair value hedges Other assets 42,209 2,517 Other liabilities - -\nMortgage loan fair value hedges Other assets 470,000 36,765 Other liabilities - -\nBorrowings cash flow hedges Other assets 1,000,000 179,945 Other liabilities - -\n$ 2,100,885 $ 286,487 $ 588,676 $ 67,260\nSeptember 30, 2021 Derivative Assets Derivative Liabilities\nInterest rate contract purpose Balance Sheet Location Notional Fair Value Balance Sheet Location Notional Fair Value\n(In thousands) (In thousands)\nClient swap program hedges Other assets $ 644,355 $ 10,983 Other liabilities $ 644,355 $ 10,983\nCommercial loan fair value hedges Other assets - - Other liabilities 44,678 2,177\nMortgage loan fair value hedges Other assets - - Other liabilities 470,000 1,641\nBorrowings cash flow hedges Other assets 1,000,000 42,442 Other liabilities - -\n$ 1,644,355 $ 53,425 $ 1,159,033 $ 14,801\nWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC.

These arrangements include hedges of individual fixed rate commercial loans and also hedges of a specified portion of pools of prepayable fixed rate mortgage loans under the \"last of layer\" method. These relationships qualify as fair value hedges under FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (\"ASC 815\"), which provides for offsetting of the recognition of gains and losses of the respective interest rate swap and the hedged items. Gains and losses on interest rate swaps designated in these hedge relationships, along with the offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings within the same income statement line item.\nUpon electing to apply ASC 815 fair value hedge accounting, the carrying value of the hedged items are adjusted to reflect the cumulative impact of changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk. The hedge basis adjustment remains with each hedged item until the hedged item is de-recognized from the balance sheet.

Under these agreements, the Company enters into a variable rate loan agreement and a swap agreement with the client. The swap agreement effectively converts the clients variable rate loan into a fixed rate. The Company enters into a corresponding swap agreement with a third party in order to offset its exposure on the variable and fixed components of the client's swap agreement. The interest rate swaps are derivatives under ASC 815, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. There was no net impact to the statement of operations for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 as the changes in fair value of the receive fixed swap and pay fixed swap offset each other.

Since net interest income on financial assets and liabilities is excluded from this guidance, a significant majority of our revenues are not subject to the new guidance.\nRevenue streams that are within the scope of the new guidance are presented within noninterest income and are, in general, recognized as revenue at the same time the Company's obligation to the customer is satisfied. Most of the Company's customer contracts that are within the scope of the new guidance are cancelable by either party without penalty and are short-term in nature. These sources of revenue include depositor and other consumer and business banking fees, commission income, as well as debit and credit card interchange fees. For fiscal years ended 2022 and 2021, in scope revenue streams represented approximately 5.6% and 5.8% of our total revenues, respectively. As this standard is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements, the Company has omitted certain disclosures in ASC 606, including the disaggregation of revenue table. Sources of noninterest income within the scope of the new guidance include the following:\nDeposit related and other service charges (recognized in Deposit Fee Income): The Company's deposit accounts are governed by standardized contracts customary in the industry. Revenues are earned at a point in time or over time (monthly) from account maintenance fees and charges for specific transactions such as wire transfers, stop payment orders, overdrafts, debit card replacements, check orders and cashiers' checks. The Companys performance obligation related to each of these fees is generally satisfied, and the related revenue recognized, at the time the service is provided (point in time or monthly). The Company is principal in each of these contracts.\nDebit and credit card interchange fees (recognized in Deposit Fee Income): The Company receives interchange fees from the debit card and credit card payment networks based on transactions involving debit or credit cards issued by the Company, generally measured as a percentage of the underlying transaction. Interchange fees from debit and credit card transactions are recognized as the transaction processing services are provided by the network. The Company acts as an agent in the card payment network arrangement so the interchange fees are recorded net of any expenses paid to the principal (the card payment networks in this case).\nInsurance agency commissions (recognized in Other Income): WAFD Insurance Group, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Washington Federal Bank that operates as an insurance agency, selling and marketing property and casualty insurance policies for a small number of high-quality insurance carriers. WAFD Insurance Group, Inc. earns revenue in the form of commissions paid by the insurance carriers for policies that have been sold. In addition to the origination commission, WAFD Insurance Group, Inc. may also receive contingent incentive fees based on the volume of business generated for the insurance carrier and based on policy renewal rates.\nWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC.

The majority of the leases contain renewal options and provisions for increases in rental rates based on a predetermined schedule or an agreed upon index. If, at lease inception, the Company considers the exercising of a renewal option to be reasonably certain, the Company will include the extended term in the calculation of the right-of-use asset and lease liability.\nOperating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets are recognized on the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that represents the Company's collateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a similar term and are included in Accrued expenses and other liabilities. The related right-of-use asset is included in Other assets.\nThe table below presents the Companys operating lease right-of-use asset and the related lease liability.\n(In thousands) September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nOperating lease asset $ 25,546 $ 27,785\nOperating lease liability $ 27,974 $ 29,569\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Companys operating leases have a weighted average remaining lease term of 8.5 years and a weighted average discount rate of 1.99%.

Company contributions are made annually as approved by the Board of Directors. Such amounts are not in excess of amounts permitted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\nPlan participants may make voluntary after-tax contributions of their considered earnings as defined by the Plan. In addition, participants may make pre-tax contributions up to the statutory limits through the 401(k) provisions of the Plan. The annual addition from contributions to an individual participant's account in this Plan cannot exceed the lesser of 100% of base salary or $61,000.\nWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022, 2021, AND 2020\nNew employees become eligible to participate in the Plan and make employee contributions on the first day of the calendar month following the completion of 30 days of employment. Such eligible employees do not become eligible for profit sharing or matching contributions until the first day of the quarter (January 1, April 1, July 1 or October 1) following completion of 1 year of service. A year of service is defined as a 12-month period in which the eligible employee works at least 1,000 hours of service and the first eligibility service period started on the first day of employment.\nThe Plan provides for a guaranteed safe harbor matching contribution equal to 100% of the first 4% of compensation that employees contribute to their account and this amount is immediately vested. The safe harbor match is not subject to the six year vesting schedule of the profit sharing contribution. This provides plan participants more investment flexibility. Additionally, the Company anticipates that all eligible employees, regardless of personal plan participation, will continue to receive an annual discretionary profit sharing contribution from the Company.\nCompany contributions to the Plan amounted to $10,559,000, $9,905,000 and $8,333,000 for the years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNOTE P - STOCK AWARD PLANS\nThe Company's stock based compensation plan provides for grants of stock options and restricted stock. On January 22, 2020, the shareholders approved the 2020 Incentive Plan. Upon approval of the 2020 Incentive Plan, the 2011 Incentive Plan terminated with respect to future awards, and the remaining shares that were not awarded under the 2011 Incentive Plan as of that date were canceled. A total of 3,200,000 shares are available for grant under the 2020 Incentive Plan and 1,882,283 shares remain available for issuance as of September 30, 2022.\nWhen applicable, stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company's stock at the date of grant; those option awards generally vest based on three to five years of continuous service and have 10-year contractual terms. The Company's policy is to issue new shares upon option exercises. The fair value of stock options granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Additionally, there may be other factors that would otherwise have a significant effect on the value of employee stock options granted but are not considered by the model. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve that is in effect at the time of grant with a remaining term equal to the options' expected life. The expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.\nStock Option Awards:\nThere were 352,043 stock options granted under the incentive plans during 2022, compared to no stock options granted in 2021 and 1,043,349 stock options granted in 2020 under the previous plan.\nWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC.

Holders of the depositary shares are entitled to all proportional rights and preferences of the Series A Preferred Stock (including, dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). The depositary shares are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \"WAFDP.\" The Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at the option of the Company, subject to all applicable regulatory approvals, on or after April 15, 2026.\nAs of September 30, 2022, and 2021, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject, and the Bank's regulators categorized it as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and participation of the Companys management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and were effective to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices in the United States of America.\nThe Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. In making the assessment, the Companys management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the 2013 version of its Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on its assessment, the Companys management believes that as of September 30, 2022, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on this criteria.\nThe Companys independent auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, have issued an audit report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting, which appears in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThere have been no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the Companys most recent fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nWashington Federal, Inc.\nSeattle, Washington\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Washington Federal, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Because managements assessment and our audit were conducted to meet the reporting requirements of Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA), managements assessment and our audit of the Companys internal control over financial reporting included controls over the preparation of the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements in accordance with the instructions for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Instructions for Call Reports for Balance Sheet on schedule RC, Income Statement on schedule RI, and Changes in Bank Equity Capital on schedule RI-A. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have not examined and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management's statement referring to compliance with laws and regulations.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022, of the Company and our report dated November 18, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nSeattle, Washington\nNovember 18, 2022 Item 9B.
