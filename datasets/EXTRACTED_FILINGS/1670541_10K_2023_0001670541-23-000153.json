These standardized manufacturing processes allow Adient to deliver high quality levels and minimize waste. Adient achieves scale advantages through a global manufacturing footprint and an integrated supply chain. Adient fosters an environment of continuous improvement and identifies best business practices through the analysis of process and cost metrics, which are then shared globally throughout Adient's manufacturing network.\nTo ensure appropriate service levels, minimal inventory and optimal factory utilization, Adient employs a Sales & Operational Planning, or S&OP, process. A well-executed S&OP process provides two strategic advantages: focused customer service and on-time delivery which result in both customer retention and the opportunity for market share gain.\nLongstanding Customer Relationships with Leading Global OEMs Adient works with OEMs to develop complete seating solutions to meet consumer expectations for performance, safety and comfort. Adient does business with all major global OEM customers, and in many cases, works closely with those customers to develop a seating solution integrated into the overall vehicle appearance and architecture.\nThrough dedicated customer teams, Adient maintains close relationships with its global OEM customers. These relationships enable Adient to clearly understand its customers' needs so that it is positioned to meet its customers' requirements. Adient's customer teams also lead the new business acquisition process, which ensures alignment with Adient's product, process and manufacturing strategies.\nProduct Innovation and Process Leadership Adient has a strong record for developing winning product and process technologies over many years, which has created a competitive advantage for Adient and its customers. Management expects to increase investment in innovation.\nAdient utilizes a global Core Product Portfolio, or CPP, strategy for part and design reuse in all of its product applications. Adient intends to continue investing in its CPP to sustain and expand its market success and to leverage its existing modular and scalable systems and interchangeable components. Through the CPP strategy, Adient provides high quality products for its customers with market competitive cost and mass (low weight to improve fuel economy) while meeting their performance requirements. Adient continues to use its CPP to advance Adient's lean manufacturing initiatives by providing standard, flexible processes that reduce complexity, inventory and floor space. This will yield reductions in development time, product cost and investment.\nGlobal Development Network Adient participates in innovating and developing key competitive differentiators in the automotive seating business. In the development process, key downstream elements of the product are locked in, including material costs, plant conversion costs, quality characteristics and certain technical requirements. Adient uses a common product development process globally that ensures that these elements are correct at the outset of the development process, reflects the best practices of Adient's operations worldwide and meets the expectations of Adient's diverse customer base. Its product launch system is customizable and scalable based on customer and product requirements.\nAdient's worldwide engineering network includes ten core development centers. These development centers utilize a globally consistent approach to the process for developing seating products. By leveraging a network of subject matter technical experts, Adient efficiently implements best practices and improves product cost and quality.

It operates through its wholly owned entities and 6 joint ventures (nonconsolidated and consolidated) with 36 manufacturing locations in 22 cities, which are supported by additional technical centers. Adient's strong position with European and American automakers is complemented by partnerships with all major auto groups in China, which has resulted in Adient's broad market penetration relative to seating competitors and market leadership in the industry's largest market. Adient leverages its operating expertise and innovation capabilities developed worldwide to further support its growth in China.\nPlatform for Global Growth Adient's current global platform creates multiple opportunities for growth, such as:\nMarket share expansion in seating and seating components. Adient has relationships with global OEM customers. These relationships, combined with Adient's product offerings, enhance Adient's ability to expand its business with regional customers who are growing and expanding globally and also with new entrants to the automotive market.\nRegional growth opportunities. Adient is able to leverage its position as the market leader in Europe, North America and China to grow in other markets, such as Southeast Asia.\nVertical integration. Adient's operations provide opportunities for continued vertical integration in areas that could enhance Adient's capabilities, expand profit margins and grow revenues with customers who employ component sourcing strategies.\nProduct/Systems\nAdient designs and manufactures a full range of seating systems and components for passenger cars, commercial vehicles and light trucks, including vans, pick-up trucks and sport/crossover utility vehicles. Adient's technologies extend into virtually every area of automotive seating solutions including complete seating systems, frames, mechanisms, foam, head restraints, armrests and trim covers.\nCustomers\nAdient is a supplier to all of the global OEMs and has longstanding relationships with premier automotive manufacturers, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz Group, Ford Motor Company, General Motors Company, Honda Motor Company, Hyundai Motor Company, Jaguar Land Rover, Kia Corporation, Mazda Motor Corporation, Mitsubishi Motor Corporation, Nissan Motor Corporation, Renault Group, Stellantis N.V., Suzuki Motor Corporation, Toyota Motor Corporation, Volkswagen Group and Volvo Car Group. Adient also supplies most of the growing regional OEMs such as Beijing Automotive Group CO., Ltd., Changan Automobile (Group) Co., Ltd., FAW Group Corporation, Proton Holdings Berhad, Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors Limited and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., Ltd. and newer auto manufacturers such as NIO and Xpeng Motors. Additionally, Adient has more than 6 joint venture partnerships with key OEMs, including Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd., Beijing Automobile Group Co., Ltd. and FAW Group Corporation. Further details regarding Adient's customers is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note 1, \"Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nIndustry\nThe Automotive Seating industry provides OEMs with complete seats on a \"just-in-time\" or \"in-sequence\" basis. Seats are assembled to specific order and delivered on a predetermined schedule directly to an automotive assembly line. The components for these complete seat assemblies such as seating foam, metal structures, fabrics, seat covers and seat mechanisms are shipped to Adient or competitor seating assembly plants. Adient is a global leader in complete seat assembly and one of the largest in all major seating components, operating manufacturing plants that produce seating foam, metal structures, seat covers and seat mechanisms.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 6\nDemand for automotive parts in the OEM market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced, which is primarily driven by macro-economic factors such as credit availability, interest rates, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment and other trends. Although OEM demand is tied to actual vehicle production, participants in the automotive supplier industry also have the opportunity to grow through increasing product content per vehicle by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets, gaining new customers and increasing their presence in global markets. Adient believes that, as a company with a global presence and advanced technology, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities, it is well positioned to benefit from these opportunities.\nSourcing Patterns by OEMs Most OEMs have adopted global vehicle platforms to increase standardization, reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability. In seating, three sourcing patterns exist:\n1. Core seat structures: By developing common front seat frames and mechanisms across multiple vehicle platforms, OEMs are reducing costs.\n2. Component sourcing: Several OEMs have shifted from sourcing a complete seating system to a components approach where the OEM sources each of the different components of the seat and seating assembly as separate business awards.\n3. Engineering \"in-sourcing\": Some OEMs are conducting the design and engineering internally and are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis and adapt to regional variations.\nAs a supplier with global scale and strong design, engineering and lean manufacturing capabilities in both complete seat systems and components, Adient is well positioned to accommodate each of these three sourcing patterns.\nShorter Product Development Cycles As a result of new safety and environmental regulations, as well as a trend of more rapid customer preference changes, OEMs are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations. Although these trends are more significant in mature markets, emerging markets are moving rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets. Suppliers with strong technologies, robust global engineering and development capabilities will be best positioned to meet OEM demands for rapid innovation.\nElectric Vehicles Electric vehicles (EVs) continue to be a focus in the global automotive industry driven by a variety of product offerings from legacy manufacturers and from new entrants. The rollout of EVs platforms vary across the regions with factors such as pricing, affordability, government incentives, infrastructure and overall consumer acceptance influencing the pace of adoption. While seating systems are not largely impacted by the shift to EVs, key attributes of seat design are evolving as the market pivots toward EVs. This movement provides Adient with unique opportunities to provide value added solutions through Adients Evolution of Seating Systems Sustainability (ES3) and to capture market share through new entrants based on Adients existing leading market position.\nAdvanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving Systems (ADS) As the global automotive industry continues to incorporate ADAS/ADS into its vehicles and as alternative usage models evolve, such as car sharing and urban mobility, Adient is poised to capitalize on greater seating content that may accompany these new innovations. Adient has developed an interiors concept for autonomous driving which addresses major seating and other interior trends that are expected to drive the automotive industry of the future. Adient will continue to partner with OEMs and other customers in the development of ADAS and ADS concepts.\nCompetition\nAdient faces competition from other automotive suppliers and, with respect to certain products, from the automobile OEMs who produce or have the capability to produce certain products the business supplies. The automotive supply industry competes on the basis of technology, quality, reliability of supply and price. Design, engineering and product planning are increasingly important factors. The competitive landscape for seating and components can be categorized into three segments: (1) traditional seating suppliers, (2) component specialists and (3) competitors who are partnered with an OEM through ownership or interlocking business relationships. Independent suppliers that represent the principal competitors of Adient include Lear Corporation, Toyota Boshoku Corporation, Forvia SE and Magna International Inc. Adient's deep vertical integration, global footprint and broad product offering make it well positioned to compete against the traditional global Tier-1 suppliers and component specialists.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 7\nRaw Materials\nRaw materials used by Adient in connection with its operations include steel, aluminum, polyurethane chemicals, fabrics, leather, vinyl and polypropylene. Continuing into fiscal 2023, the automotive industry has experienced a period of significant volatility in commodity prices. This price volatility may continue into the future as demand increases and/or supply remains constrained. Price volatility has resulted in an overall increase of input costs for Adient that may not be, or may only be partially, offset through customer negotiations. During fiscal 2024, commodity prices and availability could fluctuate throughout the year and significantly affect Adient's results of operations. Refer to the Environmental, Social and Governance heading in this Item 1, Business for information on sustainability actions Adient is taking with its products and related materials, and refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-K for additional information on risks associated with the supply of Adients raw materials.\nIntellectual Property\nGenerally, Adient seeks statutory protection for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with its business. Certain intellectual property, where appropriate, is protected by contracts, licenses, confidentiality or other agreements.\nAdient owns numerous U.S. and non-U.S. patents (and their respective counterparts), the more important of which cover those technologies and inventions embodied in current products or which are used in the manufacture of those products. While Adient believes patents are important to its business operations and in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset, no single patent, or group of patents, is critical to the success of the business. Adient, from time to time, grants licenses under its patents and technology and receives licenses under patents and technology of others.\nAdient's trademarks are registered or otherwise legally protected in the United States and many non-U.S. countries where products and services of Adient are sold.\nMost works of authorship produced for Adient, such as computer programs, catalogs and sales literature, carry appropriate notices indicating Adient's claim to copyright protection under U.S. law and appropriate international treaties.\nRegulation\nAdient operates in a constantly evolving global regulatory environment and is subject to numerous and varying regulatory requirements for its product performance and material content. Adient's practice is to identify potential regulatory and quality risks early in the design and development process and proactively manage them throughout the product lifecycle through the use of routine assessments, protocols, standards, performance measures and audits. New regulations and changes to existing regulations are managed in collaboration with the OEM customers and implemented through Adient's global systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations. Adient demonstrates material content compliance through the International Material Data System (IMDS) which is the automotive industry material data system. In the IMDS, all materials used for automobile manufacturing are archived and maintained, in order to meet the obligations placed on the automobile manufacturers and thus on their suppliers by national and international standards, laws and regulations.\nAdient works collaboratively with a number of stakeholder groups including government agencies (e.g., National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), its customers and its suppliers to proactively engage in federal, state and international public policy processes.\nLegal Matters\nAdient is involved in various lawsuits, claims and proceedings incident to the operation of its businesses, including those pertaining to product liability, environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment, commercial and contractual matters, and various other matters. Although the outcome of such lawsuits, claims and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and some may be disposed of unfavorably to Adient, it is management's opinion that none of these will have a material adverse effect on Adient's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Costs related to such matters were not material to the periods presented. Further details regarding Adient's commitments and contingencies is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note 19, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 8\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance\nAt Adient, we recognize robust and responsible environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies and practices are essential to the long-term success of our business and the well-being of our stakeholders, including our investors, employees, suppliers, customers and communities. We embed sustainability into our company by integrating ESG principles into our product development initiatives, manufacturing processes, procurement practices, corporate governance activities and other key business areas. Our board of directors and senior managers ensure we operate our business ethically and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and, as appropriate, they oversee and implement our ESG policies and strategies with input from a cross-functional team of subject matter experts across our organization. We regularly communicate our ESG targets and related actions to our stakeholders through our SEC filings, media releases, quarterly earnings reports and our annual corporate sustainability report.\nProduction Processes\nAdient remains committed to improving sustainability in its global operations and utilizing standardized processes to reduce energy consumption, conserve water and generate less waste and emissions at our facilities globally. In fiscal year 2021, Adient set a goal of reducing its scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 75% by 2030 (with 2019 as our base year), and continues to make progress toward that goal. In 2023, Adient expanded its goal with a longer term target of achieving carbon neutrality at its manufacturing locations for scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. Some recent examples of how Adient is reducing emissions and improving sustainability in its operations include:\nReplacing company pool vehicles with EVs as leases end.\nRecovering waste heat from air compressors and using it to help warm buildings.\nAdding occupant sensors to plant floors and other areas to automatically turn lights on and off as needed.\nOptimizing how foam mold temperature machines are connected in parallel to ensure only heating the necessary number of machines.\nReplacing cardboard boxes with reusable packaging and eliminating unnecessary cardboard inserts to cut waste and optimize loads.\nCollecting, storing and using rainwater in sanitary applications such as toilets.\nIn addition, Adient has set a goal to attribute 100% of the electricity needed worldwide to renewable sources by 2035. Several of Adients facilities already generate renewable electricity on-site via solar panel installations, and more than 60 Adient locations now consume electricity from a renewable source.\nProducts\nSustainability has been an inherent part of product development and innovation at Adient for more than three decades, and customers sustainability targets are closely tracked to ensure its efforts align with the needs and goals of its customers. More recently, vehicle electrification and a general move toward increasingly efficient transportation have emphasized the need for automotive seating products that are lighter, slimmer and made of more environmentally friendly materials than traditional seating products. To help meet this need, Adient has developed products such as the Soft Back Panel and Soft Side Valance components, which integrate up to 70% recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) while improving knee clearance and reducing the weight of each seat by as much as 2 kg. Adient has also developed an innovative, EV-ready concept seat - the Pure Essential - that combines a high degree of comfort with a sleek appearance while reducing cost, complexity, weight and the seats overall carbon footprint. The Pure Essential seat promotes product circularity by using just two primary eco-friendly material types: green steel for the seat structure and recyclable polyester for comfort features and trim covers. Through Adients ES3 approach to product design, Adient is continuously identifying and integrating materials and manufacturing methods that minimize environmental impact and promote a circular economy.\nAdient also recognizes the importance of its supply chains environmental risks and impacts and are working with its suppliers to reduce scope 3 (value chain) emissions 35% by 2030 (with 2019 as the base year). In fiscal year 2024, Adient plans to expand the use of its proprietary Product Carbon Footprint Tool - data-based software that calculates the carbon footprint of a specific product based on its bill of materials - impacting designer, engineer and customer decisions and supporting its scope 3 emissions-reduction goal. As noted in Adients recently updated Deforestation Commitment and Policy and natural resources webpage, Adient is making progress on its commitments in procuring forest commodities from more sustainable sources to reduce the impact on deforestation and protect natural habitats globally.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 9\nPeople\nAdient continues to work to protect the human rights and well-being of its employees, suppliers, customers and communities in which Adient operates globally. To those ends, Adient updated its Ethics Policy in 2023 to address evolving laws and regulations, including those regarding ESG. Employees reviewed the updated Ethics Policy as part of the annual ethics certification campaign. In 2023, Adient also initiated ESG-related due diligence questionnaires for top suppliers to promote transparency in supply chain human rights policies and practices. Additionally, Adient is proud to support women-, minority- and veteran-owned businesses by spending more than $1 billion with diverse suppliers every year.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAdient's ability to sustain and grow its business requires it to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse workforce. Adient values character and integrity as much as qualifications and fosters an empowerment culture where employees have ownership in business outcomes. The highest levels of Adients management drive these practices with the alignment and support of all levels within the organization. Our Executive Vice President, Chief Legal and Human Resources Officer, and Corporate Secretary, reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), oversees Adients global talent processes to attract, develop and retain the most valuable asset - its employees. Adient has more than 70,000 employees worldwide who represent a wide variety of backgrounds. Adients workforce composition (including employees at consolidated joint ventures), as of September 30, 2023, consists of approximately:\n45% work in the Americas, 42% work in EMEA and 13% work in our Asia-Pacific region\n41% of the global workforce is female\n49% of employees in the U.S. have identified themselves as an ethnic minority\nAdient ensures its people are engaged and working collaboratively to achieve company goals through positive employee relations activities that focus on supporting employees and their families. Adient also provides and encourages many forms of corporate communication such as town hall meetings, open-door policy and an ethics Integrity Helpline so that employees can hear directly from Adient leadership and have the opportunity to ask questions, make suggestions and provide input. Because the attraction, development and retention of the employee base is significant to its business strategy, executive management provides frequent updates on these metrics to the board of directors.\nHealth and Safety\nWe are committed to protecting the safety and well-being of our colleagues, customers, suppliers and people using our premises by providing and maintaining a safe working environment that protects both physical and mental well-being. Adient requires protective equipment, enforces comprehensive safety policies and procedures, and encourages employees and leaders to look regularly for ways to improve workplace safety. Adient has implemented and maintains a health and safety management system that is certified to the ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety standard. Globally, 100% of Adients facilities are internally audited and compliant, and 60% are also third-party audited and certified. We work together across the globe, sharing best practice ideas, procedures, and information regarding accidents and injuries. At Adient, every new machine, operation, building or workstation change requires a safety risk assessment. When our employees come to work, they can know that where they work has undergone an extensive review of associated risks of injury or illness and that those risks are eliminated and/or minimized through robust controls. Adient provides regular updates on health and safety to its board of directors.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nAdient strives to build a culture of diversity and inclusion through our purchasing and human resource practices and policies, and we strive to eliminate discrimination and harassment in all its forms, including but not limited to discrimination against women, minorities and other protected groups. Adient President and CEO Doug Del Grosso signed the \"CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion\" pledge promulgated by the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion initiative, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. In addition, Adient is a member of the Center for Automotive Diversity, Inclusion and Advancement (CADIA). In fiscal 2022, Adient published two documents - a Human Rights Policy Statement and a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) Commitment Statement - both of which emphasize Adients commitment to protecting the safety, well-being and human rights of our people while driving a diverse and inclusive work culture. Adient developed and tracks human capital metrics relating to diversity and inclusion, which the Chief Legal and Human Resources Officer reviews semi-annually with the board of directors.\nSince success in this area requires listening to diverse voices, Adient established DE&I Councils in each of its three business regions: 1) the Americas, which is inclusive of North America and South America; 2) Europe, the Middle East and Africa\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 10\n(EMEA) and 3) Asia Pacific/China (Asia). These councils drive strategic and tactical actions in the areas of talent acquisition and retention, communications and employee feedback, training and education, metrics and key performance indicators, and Adients diverse and employee-led business resource groups (BRGs). While the three councils primarily work within their regions, they also communicate and collaborate across regions to ensure alignment and progress toward enterprise-wide DE&I goals. Additionally, Adient has an annual global online training to all salaried employees focused on DE&I.\nIn 2023, Adient employees launched a new BRG in the Americas region - the South Asian Community (SAC) BRG - in addition to growing the existing HOLA! (Hispanic Origins Latino Ancestry) BRG, African Ancestry BRG (AABRG), True Colors Network (TCN), and Womens Resource Network (WRN). We continue to develop and refine our diversity initiatives to achieve our DE&I vision of being a premier employer that champions an inclusive and equitable work culture enriched by our diversity, where all employees are valued and respected.\nSuccession and Talent Development\nAt Adient, we believe that attracting, developing, motivating and retaining employees is key to our sustainable and profitable growth. We understand that, like customers, our employees and potential employees have choices of where to work, and we must compete for the best talent. Adient supports employee development in multiple ways. Adient has a global performance management process through which employees provide a self-assessment and managers provide evaluation and feedback on performance. This process informs employee development goals. Adient's Leadership Talent Review (LTR) is its annual process for identifying and evaluating talent for the purposes of aligning individual aspirations and development plans with the organization's needs and building a diverse pipeline of leaders to mitigate leadership vacancy risk. LTR is designed to be an inclusive process that promotes visibility of talent, increases the validity of succession plans and ensures development efforts are applied efficiently. Talent potential assessments and succession plans are calibrated with broader groups of leaders to drive consistency, awareness and alignment on decisions and development actions. Adient's executive leadership provides annual updates on succession and talent development to the board of directors.\nSeasonal Factors\nAdient's principal operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, Adient may experience seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants close for model year changeovers and in December when many customer plants close for the holidays.\nAvailable Information\nAdient's Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").

Oswald, the current Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations, and Corporate Communications, will be appointed as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective January 1, 2024.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 13 Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.\nThe business, financial condition and operating results of Adient can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause Adient's actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect Adient's business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting Adient's financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Related to Adient's Global Business\nGeneral economic, credit, capital market and global political conditions could adversely affect Adient's financial performance, Adient's ability to grow or sustain its businesses and Adient's ability to access the capital markets.\nAdient competes around the world in various geographic regions and product markets. Global economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions, inflationary concerns and labor availability, affect Adient's business. As discussed in greater detail below, any future distress in the industries and/or markets where Adient competes could negatively affect Adient's revenues and financial performance in future periods, result in future restructuring charges, and adversely impact Adient's ability to grow or sustain its businesses.\nThe global automotive industry has experienced significant volatility over the past few years relative to supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, labor shortages, geopolitical uncertainties, higher interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. Although Adient's seating products have not typically been dependent directly on the components causing the supply chain disruptions, Adient has been directly impacted by lower production levels at the OEMs as a direct result of these disruptions. These disruptions have moderated in fiscal 2023, but supply chains remain fragile and in the past have led to unplanned downtime at Adient's production facilities, often with very little warning, which created operating inefficiencies and limited Adient's ability to adequately mitigate such inefficiencies. The automotive industry has also experienced a period of significant price volatility (generally resulting in an increase in commodities, energy costs, freight costs, labor costs and other input costs), as well as encountering an environment of unfavorable foreign currency exposures and rising interest rates. While some of these input cost increases have moderated in fiscal 2023, other exposures will likely continue into fiscal 2024 and perhaps further into the future. This environment of significant price volatility has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased costs for Adient that may not be, or may only be partially, offset. Adient also experienced constrained labor availability which has resulted in wage inflationary pressures, both internally and at key vendors. Adient continues to assess any impact labor shortages and wage inflation might have on Adient's ability to perform its obligations. Although Adient has developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions along with the impact of higher input and other costs, these strategies, together with commercial negotiations with Adient's customers and suppliers, typically offset only a portion (less than 100%) of the adverse impact. Additionally, Adient's operating model requires long lead times between the design and development of products and the launch of production. This lead time requires Adient to secure vendor supply well in advance to minimize launch and production inefficiencies. During such lead times, price commitments are subject to change and could lead to an inability of Adient to fully recover all such price changes.\nThe capital and credit markets provide Adient with liquidity to operate and grow its business beyond the liquidity that operating cash flows provide. A worldwide economic downturn and/or disruption of the credit markets likely would reduce Adient's access to capital necessary for its operations and executing its strategic plan. Adient's ability to borrow against the ABL Credit Facility is limited to its borrowing base, which consists primarily of accounts receivable, inventory and certain cash account balances. Such working capital account balances fluctuate significantly depending on production levels and operating activities. If Adient's access to capital were to become constrained significantly, or if costs of capital increased significantly, due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, the volatility of the capital markets or other factors, Adient's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows likely would be adversely affected.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 14\nUnfavorable changes in the condition of the global automotive industry and the condition of individual automakers may adversely affect Adient's results of operations.\nAdient's financial performance depends, in part, on conditions in the automotive industry. Automotive production and sales are highly cyclical and depend on general economic conditions and other factors, including consumer spending and preferences. Automakers may experience a decline in the number of new vehicle sales, whether as a result of economic decline, ongoing supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, increasing consumer borrowing rates or for various other reasons. Automakers may also become less cost competitive due to rising input costs, such as labor or raw materials, and thereby experience a loss of demand for their products as consumers shift to lower cost options. As a result, Adient may experience reductions in orders from these customers, incur write-offs of accounts receivable, incur impairment charges or require additional restructuring actions beyond its current restructuring plans, particularly if any of the automakers cannot adequately fund their operations or experience financial distress. Such adverse changes likely would have a negative impact on Adient's business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, Adient relies in part on its customers forecasting of their expected needs, which forecasts can change rapidly and may not be accurate. Any inaccurate forecast data received by customers could also have an adverse impact on Adients results of operations.\nRisks associated with joint venture partnerships may adversely affect Adient's business and financial results.\nAdient has several joint ventures worldwide and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Adient's joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with Adient's goals or with the goals of the joint venture which could lead to, among other things, dissolution, liquidation and/or modification of the joint venture terms. Adient may compete against its joint venture partners in certain of its markets and certain negotiations with its customers may negatively impact its joint venture business with those same customers. Disagreements with Adient's business partners may impede Adient's ability to maximize the benefits of its partnerships and/or may consume management time and other resources to negotiate, and which could lead to, among other things, dissolution, liquidation and/or modification of the joint venture terms. Adient's joint venture arrangements may require Adient, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek its joint venture partner's consent to take certain actions. Adient does not control the ability to collect cash dividends from its non-consolidated joint ventures. In addition, Adient does not control the financial reporting of its non-consolidated joint ventures, which may impact its ability to complete its financial statements in a timely or accurate manner. Delays in the collection of dividends, even by a few days, could adversely affect Adient's financial position and cash flows. Adient's joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents, and Adient may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture. Further, joint venture partnerships are subject to renewal or expiration at various times. The failure to renew or extend the terms of Adients joint venture partnerships could impact other areas of Adients business, including its business relationships. The above risks, if realized, could result in a material adverse effect on Adient's business and financial results.\nFurthermore, non-consolidated joint ventures present various risks, including the risk that Adient may be slower or less able to identify or react to problems affecting its non-consolidated joint ventures than Adient would for a wholly-owned subsidiary or consolidated joint venture. In addition, these arrangements may cause Adient to be slower to detect compliance related problems and make its design of effective internal controls more challenging. Each of these challenges may be more costly to implement, and the risk of failure potentially higher, than would be the case in a more centralized structure. Depending on the nature of the problems, the failure to identify, detect or react could materially adversely affect Adients business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks associated with Adient's non-U.S. operations could adversely affect Adient's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdient has significant operations in a number of countries outside the U.S., some of which are located in emerging markets. Long-term economic or political uncertainty in some of the regions of the world in which Adient operates, such as Asia, South America and Europe and other emerging markets, could result in the disruption of markets and negatively affect cash flows from Adient's operations to cover its capital needs and debt service requirements.\nIn addition, as a result of Adient's global presence, a significant portion of its revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Adient is therefore subject to foreign currency risks and foreign exchange exposure. While Adient employs financial instruments to hedge some of its transactional foreign exchange exposure, these activities do not insulate Adient completely from those exposures. Exchange rates can be volatile and could adversely impact Adient's financial results and the comparability of results from period to period. Our use of financial instruments to limit this risk is guided by strict policies and processes and the success of our hedging programs depends primarily on the performance of the business in\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 15\ncomparison with our forecasted sales proceeds and costs. If we incorrectly forecast these and other related factors, the transactions we have entered into may have an adverse impact on our financial results. No assurance can be given that our judgment in this respect will be correct.\nThere are other risks that are inherent in Adient's non-U.S. operations, including the potential for changes in socioeconomic conditions, laws and regulations, including sanctions, import, export, direct and indirect taxes, value-added taxes, labor and environmental laws, and monetary and fiscal policies; protectionist measures that may prohibit acquisitions or joint ventures, or impact trade volumes; unsettled political conditions or instability; government-imposed plant or other operational shutdowns; backlash from foreign labor organizations related to Adient's restructuring actions; asset freezes and seizures; corruption; natural and man-made disasters; global health epidemics (such as COVID-19); hazards and losses; armed conflict, territorial disputes or acts of aggression in Asia, South America, Europe or otherwise; violence, civil and labor unrest; and possible terrorist attacks.\nOn December 30, 2020, the U.K. completed its withdrawal from the European Union and entered into an agreement regarding their future relationship, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which was ratified by the parties and entered into full force on May 1, 2021. However, certain economic uncertainties remain in connection with the future of the U.K. and its relationship with the European Union. These uncertainties have caused and may continue to cause disruptions to capital and currency markets worldwide as well as cause disruptions on Adients operations.\nRussias invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 resulted in significant uncertainty and instability in global supply chains and availability of certain commodities and raw materials. Although Adient has no operations in Ukraine and its operation in Russia has since been disposed, certain of its suppliers as well as customers depend on commodities and other material supplies that originate in Ukraine or Russia. In response to Russias invasion in Ukraine, a number of countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and members of the European Union, have implemented economic sanctions on Russia and certain Russian enterprises including several large banks. The conflict also led to increases in the cost of energy and the potential for energy shortages, especially in Europe. Although the impact of this conflict has moderated in fiscal 2023, if the conflict continues or expands, it may trigger a series of additional economic and other sanctions which in turn could further disrupt the global automotive supply chains by limiting supplies of key components and increasing inflationary pressures. This ongoing conflict, along with other geopolitical uncertainties such as the current conflict in the Middle East, could have broader adverse impacts on macroeconomic factors that impact Adient's business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdient's business in China is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions.\nMaintaining a strong position in the Chinese market is a key component of Adient's strategy. Adient's business in China is conducted through both consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated joint ventures. The automotive supply market in China is highly competitive, with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers. As the size of the Chinese market evolves and as Chinese OEMs penetrate other markets around the globe, often with lower-cost products, Adient anticipates that market participants will act aggressively to increase or maintain their market share. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and Adient's inability to gain or hold market share. In addition to the risks imposed by U.S. economic trade policy discussed further below, Adient's business in China is sensitive to economic, political and market conditions that drive automotive sales volumes in China. If Adient is unable to maintain its position in the Chinese market, or if vehicle sales in China decrease or do not continue to increase, then Adient's business and financial results may be adversely affected.\nChanges in U.S. administrative policy, including changes to existing trade agreements and any resulting changes in international trade relations, may have an adverse effect on Adient.\nThere is continued uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.S. and various other countries, most significantly China, with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. Under the Biden administration, changes in U.S. administrative policy could lead to changes to existing trade agreements, greater restrictions on free trade generally, and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., particularly tariffs on products manufactured in Mexico and China, among other possible changes. A trade war, other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements, changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where Adient currently manufactures and sells products, and any resulting negative sentiments towards the U.S. as a result of such changes, likely would have an adverse effect on Adient's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 16\nThe regulation of Adient's international operations, and any failure of Adient to comply with those regulations, could adversely affect its business, results of operations and reputation.\nDue to Adient's global operations, Adient is subject to many laws governing international relations and its international operations, including laws that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers and that restrict where Adient can do business, what information or products Adient can import and export to and from certain countries and what information Adient can provide to a non-U.S. government. These laws include but are not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Irish Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, the U.S. Export Administration Act and U.S. and international economic sanctions and money laundering regulations. Adient has internal policies and procedures relating to compliance with such laws; however, there is a risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect Adient from the improper acts of employees, agents, business partners, joint venture partners or representatives, particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures. Violations of these laws, which are complex, may result in criminal penalties, sanctions and/or fines, and may also result in costly and time-consuming governmental investigations, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on Adient's business, financial condition and results of operations and reputation. In addition, Adient is subject to antitrust laws in various countries throughout the world. Changes in these laws or their interpretation, administration or enforcement may occur over time. Any such changes may limit Adient's future acquisitions, divestitures or operations. Violations of antitrust laws may result in penalties, sanctions and/or fines, and may also result in costly and time-consuming governmental investigations, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on Adient's business, financial condition and results of operations and reputation.\nRisks Related to Adient's Operations\nIncreases in the costs and restrictions on the availability of raw materials, energy, commodities, freight, labor and product components could adversely affect Adient's financial performance.\nRaw material, energy, commodity, freight and labor costs can be volatile. Although Adient has developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of higher raw material, energy, commodity, freight and labor costs, these strategies, together with commercial negotiations with Adient's customers and suppliers, may only offset a portion of the adverse impact. Certain of these strategies also may limit Adient's opportunities in a declining commodity environment. In addition, the availability of raw materials, commodities, transportation and product components fluctuates from time to time due to factors outside of Adient's control. Due to a variety of global factors, the automotive industry has experienced, and may continue to experience, supply chain disruptions from an insufficient availability of raw materials, components and labor. As a result of these disruptions, the automotive industry has seen volatility in the volume of automobile production, which has resulted in, and may continue to result in, decreased sales, without a corresponding decrease in labor costs, for Adient. In addition, the automotive industry has seen periods of price increases for commodities, primarily related to steel, and to a lesser extent petrochemicals, and energy costs in Europe. Adient has also experienced constrained labor availability which has resulted in wage inflationary pressures, both internally and at key vendors. Given the recent United Auto Workers (UAW) strike beginning in September 2023, and UAWs ongoing strategy of targeted strikes, Adient may see increased pressure for wage and benefit increases in the U.S. These increases may continue into the future as demand increases and as supply may remain constrained, which has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased costs for Adient. If the costs of raw materials, energy, commodities, freight costs, labor costs and product components increase or the availability thereof is restricted, it could adversely affect Adient's financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nAdient operates in the highly competitive automotive supply industry.\nThe global automotive component supply industry is highly competitive. Competition is based primarily on price, technology, quality, delivery and overall customer service. There can be no assurance that Adient's products will be able to compete successfully with the products of Adient's competitors. Furthermore, the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which Adient competes, including as a result of the autonomous vehicle market and consumer preferences for mobility on demand services, such as car- and ride-sharing, may attract new entrants. Additionally, consolidation in the automotive industry may lead to decreased product purchases from Adient.\nAs a result, Adient's sales levels and margins could be adversely affected by pricing pressures from OEMs and pricing actions of competitors. These factors may lead to selective resourcing of business to competitors. Adient's competitors may develop, design or duplicate technologies that compete with Adient's owned or licensed intellectual property. Developments or assertions by or against Adient relating to intellectual property rights, or any inability to protect Adient's rights, could have an adverse impact on its business and competitive position. In addition, any of Adient's competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than Adient, develop products that are superior to Adient's products, produce similar products at a\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 17\nlower cost than Adient, or adapt more quickly than Adient to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Adient cannot provide assurances that certain of Adients products will not become obsolete or that Adient will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary to remain competitive. As a result, Adient's products may not be able to compete successfully with its competitors' products and Adient may not be able to meet the growing demands of customers. In addition, Adients customers may increase levels of production insourcing for a variety of reasons, such as shifts in customers business strategies or the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in other countries. These trends may adversely affect Adient's sales as well as the profit margins on Adient's products.\nAdient's profitability and results of operations may be adversely affected by a significant failure or inability to comply with the specifications and manufacturing requirements of its OEM customers or by program launch difficulties.\nAdient's business faces the production demands and requirements of its OEM customers, as described in Item 1, \"Business\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result of safety and environmental regulations, as well as a trend of more rapid customer preference changes, OEMs are requiring suppliers like Adient to respond faster with new designs and product innovations. A significant failure or inability to comply with customer specifications and manufacturing requirements or delays or other problems with existing or new products often results in financial penalties, increased costs, loss of sales, loss of customers or potential breaches of customer contracts, which likely would have an adverse effect on Adient's profitability and results of operations.\nIn addition, to the extent Adient experiences product launch difficulties (which could be the result of a wide range of factors, including the production readiness of Adient's and its suppliers' manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes, as well as factors related to tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors), vehicle production at Adients customers could be significantly delayed or shut down. Such situations could result in significant financial penalties to Adient, a diversion of personnel and financial resources to improving launches rather than investment in continuous process improvement or other growth initiatives, and could result in Adients customers shifting work away from Adient to a competitor, all of which could result in loss of revenue, loss of market share and likely would have an adverse effect on Adients profitability and cash flows. Adient's failure to successfully launch material new or takeover business, or Adient's inability to accurately estimate the cost to design, develop and launch new or takeover business, likely would have an adverse effect on Adient's profitability and results of operations.\nAdient may not be able to successfully negotiate pricing and other terms with its customers or may be unable to achieve product cost reductions that offset customer-imposed price reductions, both of which may adversely affect its results of operations.\nAdient negotiates sales price adjustments and other contractual terms periodically with its automotive customers. There is no guarantee that Adient will be able to successfully negotiate pricing or other terms that are favorable or beneficial to Adient. Further, any cost-cutting initiatives that its customers adopt generally result in increased downward pressure on pricing. If Adient is unable to generate sufficient production or supply chain cost savings in the future to offset price reductions, Adient's results of operations may be adversely affected. In particular, large commercial settlements with Adient's customers likely would adversely affect Adient's results of operations. In addition, Adient must negotiate contract and other program changes during the life of customer programs to address situations unforeseen at the beginning of the program, including those relating to labor shortages and material cost increases. The inability of Adient to negotiate these contract or program changes in a manner favorable to Adient could also adversely affect Adients results of operations.\nWork stoppages, including those at Adients customers, and similar events could significantly disrupt Adient's business.\nBecause the automotive industry relies heavily on just-in-time delivery of components during the assembly and manufacture of vehicles, a work stoppage at one or more of Adient's manufacturing and assembly facilities could have adverse effects on the business. Similarly, if one or more of Adient's customers were to experience a work stoppage, such as what occurred during the UAW strike in the U.S. beginning in September 2023 resulting in an estimated $155 million of lost revenue to Adient (through November 3, 2023), ongoing supply chain disruptions, or otherwise, that customer would likely halt or limit purchases of Adient's products, which could result in the shutdown of the related Adient manufacturing facilities and or other cost-reduction initiatives. In addition in certain instances we may be unable to adjust our staffing levels to correspond to a customers work stoppage such that we incur increased labor costs along with a decrease in production. A significant disruption in the supply of a key component due to a work stoppage at one of Adient's suppliers or any other supplier could have the same consequences, and accordingly, have an adverse effect on Adient's financial results.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 18\nAdient may be unable to realize the expected benefits of its restructuring actions, which could adversely affect its profitability and operations.\nIn order to align Adient's resources with its strategies, operate more efficiently and control costs and to realign its businesses, with customer and market needs and operating conditions, Adient has periodically announced, and in the future may continue to announce, restructuring plans, which may include workforce reductions, global plant closures and consolidations, asset impairments and other cost reduction initiatives. In each of the last five fiscal years, Adient announced restructurings related to cost reduction initiatives, which included workforce reductions, plant closures and asset impairments. Adient may undertake additional restructuring actions, including plant closures and workforce reductions in the future. As these plans and actions are complex, unforeseen factors could result in expected savings and benefits to be delayed or not realized to the full extent planned (if at all), and Adient's operations and business may be disrupted, which likely would adversely affect Adient's financial condition, operating results and cash flow. Furthermore, to the extent such initiatives involve workforce changes, such changes may temporarily reduce workforce productivity, which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nA failure of Adient's information technology (IT) and data security infrastructure could adversely impact Adient's business, operations and reputation.\nAdient relies upon the capacity, reliability and security of its IT and data security infrastructure, as well as its ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of its business. If Adient experiences a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of Adient's IT systems, including a potential ransomware attack, due to failure to timely upgrade systems or during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on Adient's business.\nAdient and certain of its third-party vendors receive and store personal information in connection with Adient's human resources operations and other aspects of Adient's business. Despite Adient's implementation of security measures, Adient's IT systems, like those of other companies, are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack, ransomware attack, and other similar disruptions. Any system failure, accident or cyber security breach or incident could result in disruptions to Adient's operations. A material network breach in the security of Adient's IT systems could lead to the theft of Adient's intellectual property, trade secrets, customer information, human resources information or other confidential information. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to Adient's data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential, proprietary or customer information, it could cause significant damage to Adient's reputation, affect Adient's relationships with its customers and vendors, lead to claims against Adient and ultimately harm its business. In addition, Adient may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nIn addition, legislators and/or regulators in countries in which Adient operates are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws. In particular, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and the China security law both have extra-territorial scope. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in penalties, sanctions and/or fines, and may also result in costly and time-consuming governmental investigations, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on Adient's business, financial condition and results of operations and reputation.\nNegative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect Adient's results of operations.\nAdverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of Adient's operations in several jurisdictions could lead to additional changes in Adient's valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax reserves on Adient's statements of financial position. Additionally, changes in tax laws in Ireland, the U.S. or in other countries where Adient has significant operations could materially affect deferred tax assets and liabilities on Adient's statements of financial position and income tax provision on Adient's statements of income.\nAdient is also subject to tax audits for both direct and indirect taxes by governmental authorities on a worldwide basis. Governmental authorities have become more aggressive in proposing tax assessments, including interest related to income taxes and transaction taxes such as Value Added Tax (VAT). Negative unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect Adient's results of operations.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 19\nIf Adient does not respond appropriately, the evolution of the automotive industry towards autonomous vehicles and mobility on demand services could adversely affect Adients business.\nThe automotive industry is increasingly focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies, with the goal of developing and introducing a commercially-viable, fully automated driving experience. There has also been an increase in consumer preferences for mobility on demand services, such as car- and ride-sharing, as opposed to automobile ownership, which may result in a long term reduction in the number of vehicles per capita. These evolving areas have also attracted increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry. If Adient does not continue to innovate to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies in response to OEM and consumer preferences, this could have an adverse impact on Adients results of operations.\nAdient may incur material losses and costs as a result of warranty claims and product liability actions that may be brought against Adient.\nAdient faces an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty claims and product liability in the event that its products fail to perform as expected and, in the case of product liability, such failure of its products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. While Adient will maintain reasonable limits of insurance coverage to appropriately respond to such exposures, large product liability claims, if made, could exceed Adient's insurance coverage limits and insurance may not continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all Adient may incur significant costs to defend these claims or experience product liability losses in the future. If any of Adient's products are or are alleged to be defective, Adient may be required to participate in a recall involving such products. As suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions, auto manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims. A recall claim brought against Adient that is not insured, or a product liability claim brought against Adient in excess of its available insurance, could have an adverse impact on Adient's results of operations. In addition, a recall claim could require Adient to review its entire product portfolio to assess whether similar issues are present in other product lines, which could result in significant disruption to Adient's business and could have an adverse impact on Adient's results of operations.\nAuto manufacturers are also increasingly requiring their suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties. Depending on the terms under which Adient supplies products to an auto manufacturer, an auto manufacturer may attempt to hold Adient responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of defective products under new vehicle warranties, when the vehicle manufacturer asserts that the product supplied did not perform as warranted.\nAlthough Adient cannot assure that the future costs of warranty claims by its customers and product liability claims will not be material, Adient believes its established reserves are adequate to cover potential settlements. Adient's reserves are based on Adient's best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims. Adient regularly evaluates the level of these reserves, and adjusts them when appropriate. However, the final amounts determined to be due related to these matters could differ materially from Adient's recorded estimates.\nAny changes in consumer credit availability or cost of borrowing could adversely affect Adient's business.\nDeclines in the availability of consumer credit and increases in consumer borrowing costs have negatively impacted global automotive sales and resulted in lower production volumes in the past. Substantial declines in automotive sales and production by Adient's customers likely would have an adverse effect on Adient's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGlobal climate change and related emphasis on ESG matters by various stakeholders could negatively affect Adient's business.\nIncreased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. Such regulatory uncertainty extends to future incentives for energy efficient vehicles and costs of compliance, which may impact the demand for Adient's products and Adient's results of operations.\nThe effects of climate change, such as extreme weather conditions, create financial risk to Adient's business. For example, the demand for Adient's products and services may be affected by unseasonable weather conditions. Climate changes could also disrupt Adient's operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs. These factors may impact Adient's decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 20\nfacilities in areas most prone to physical climate risks. Adient could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain, and process disruptions due to physical climate changes could result in price modifications for Adient's products and the resources needed to produce them.\nFurthermore, customer, investor, regulatory and employee expectations in areas such as ESG have been rapidly evolving and increasing. Specifically, regulatory bodies around the globe continue to develop ESG reporting requirements, many of which will be subject to independent audits. Emerging European legislation is requiring detailed emissions data reporting for imported carbon intensive commodities, subject to financial payment mechanisms after a transition period. Further European legislation is requiring extensive value chain diligence for forest related commodities to ensure goods do not result from recent deforestation, forest degradation or breaches of local law. Also, certain customers are beginning to require that Adient provide information on its plans and goals relating to certain climate-related matters such as carbon and greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy. Product design activities for lower carbon emission products must keep pace with customer carbon emission reduction and pricing expectations. The enhanced stakeholder focus on ESG issues relating to Adient requires the continuous monitoring of various and evolving standards and the associated reporting requirements. A failure to adequately meet regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations or achieve its ESG-related goals may result in the loss of business, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract customers or an inability to attract and retain top talent.\nAs of the date of this filing, Adient has made several public commitments regarding our intended reduction of carbon emissions, including commitments to science-based targets to reduce carbon emissions from its operations and the operations of its customers. Although Adient intends to meet these commitments, it may be required to expend significant resources to do so, which could increase its operational costs. Further, there can be no assurance that any of Adients commitments will be achieved, or that any future investments it makes to achieve such targets and goals will meet investor expectations or any binding or non-binding legal standards regarding sustainability performance. Moreover, Adient may determine that it is in the best interest of Adient and its shareholders to prioritize other business, social, governance or sustainable investments over the achievement of our current commitments based on economic, regulatory and social factors, business strategy or pressure from investors, activist groups or other stakeholders. If Adient is unable to meet these commitments, then it could incur adverse publicity and reactions from investors, activist groups and other stakeholders, which could adversely impact the perception of Adient and its products and services by current and potential customers, as well as investors, which could in turn adversely impact its results of operations.\nRisks related to Adient's defined benefit retirement plans may adversely impact Adient's results of operations and cash flow.\nSignificant changes in actual investment return on defined benefit plan assets, discount rates, mortality assumptions and other factors could adversely affect Adient's results of operations and the amounts of contributions Adient must make to its defined benefit plans in future periods. For example, Adient has recorded mark-to-market adjustments on the revaluation of its pension obligations that have significantly impacted its overall results the past two years. Generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. require that Adient calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. Funding requirements for Adient's defined benefit plans are dependent upon, among other factors, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to defined benefit funding obligations.\nLegal proceedings in which Adient is, or may be, a party may adversely affect Adient.\nAdient is currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial, contractual or other disputes. These are typically lawsuits, claims and proceedings that arise in the normal course of business including, without limitation, claims pertaining to product liability, product safety, environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment, commercial, contractual and various other matters. The outcome of such lawsuits, claims or proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and some may be disposed of unfavorably to Adient. There exists the possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on Adient's results of operations that is greater than Adient anticipates, and/or negatively affect Adient's reputation.\nA downgrade in the ratings of Adient's debt capital could restrict Adient's ability to access the debt capital markets and increase Adient's interest costs.\nUnfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to Adient's debt may ultimately negatively impact Adient's access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs Adient incurs to borrow funds. Future tightening in the credit markets and a reduced level of liquidity in many financial markets due to turmoil in the financial and banking industries could adversely affect Adient's access to the debt capital markets or the price Adient pays to issue debt. A downgrade in Adient's ratings or volatility in the financial markets causing limitations to the debt capital markets could have an adverse effect on Adient's business or\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 21\nAdient's ability to meet its liquidity needs. There can be no assurance that Adient would be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing and failure to obtain such additional financing or refinancing could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Adient may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future. If Adient incurs more debt in the future and does not retire existing debt, the risks described above could increase.\nAdient's debt obligations could adversely affect Adient's business, profitability and the ability to meet its obligations.\nAs of September 30, 2023, Adient's total consolidated indebtedness approximated $2.5 billion. This significant amount of debt could potentially have adverse consequences to Adient and its debt and equity investors, including:\nmaking it more difficult to satisfy other obligations;\nincreasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of its debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing;\nincreasing Adient's vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\nplacing Adient at a competitive disadvantage relative to its competitors that may not be as highly leveraged with debt; and\nlimiting Adient's ability to borrow additional funds as needed.\nAdient's business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel and our attempts to fully reopen our offices and operate under a hybrid working environment may not be successful.\nAdient's ability to sustain and grow its business requires it to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that Adient has the leadership capacity with the necessary skill set and experience could impede Adient's ability to deliver its growth objectives and execute its strategic plan. Organizational and reporting changes as a result of any future leadership transition and corporate initiatives, including restructuring actions, could result in increased turnover. Additionally, any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees could have a negative effect on Adient's results of operations. Further, certain of the recent austerity measures related to employee compensation, along with the on-going unpredictability of production schedules, could result in employees pursuing other employment opportunities outside of Adient.\nAdient is operating under a hybrid working environment, meaning that the majority of its non-plant employees have the flexibility to work remotely at least some of the time, for the foreseeable future. The hybrid working environment may impair Adients ability to maintain its collaborative and innovative culture, and may cause disruptions among employees, including decreases in productivity, challenges in communications between on-site and off-site employees and, potentially, employee dissatisfaction and attrition. If Adients attempts to operate under a hybrid working environment are not successful, its business could be adversely impacted.\nAdverse developments affecting, or the financial distress of, one or more of Adient's suppliers or other third party counterparties could adversely affect Adient's financial performance.\nAdient obtains components and other products and services from numerous automotive suppliers and other vendors throughout the world. In addition, Adient is party to various arrangements with third parties who owe Adient money or goods and services, or who purchase goods and services from Adient. Adient is responsible for managing its supply chain, including suppliers that may be the sole sources of products that Adient requires, which Adient's customers direct Adient to use or which have unique capabilities that would make it difficult and/or expensive to re-source. In addition, with fewer sources of supply for certain components, each supplier may perceive that it has greater leverage and, therefore, some ability to seek higher prices from us at a time that we face substantial pressure from OEMs to reduce the prices of our products. This could adversely affect our customer relations and business. In certain instances entire industries may experience short-term capacity constraints. Additionally, Adient's production capacity, and that of Adient's customers and suppliers, may be adversely affected by natural disasters. Any such significant disruption could adversely affect Adient's financial performance. Unfavorable economic or industry conditions could also result in financial distress within Adient's supply chain or among other third party counterparties, thereby increasing the risk of supply disruption or lost orders. Although market conditions generally have improved in recent years, uncertainty remains and another economic downturn or other unfavorable industry conditions in one or more of the regions in which Adient operates could cause a supply disruption or loss of customer orders and thereby adversely affect Adient's financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 22\nThe loss of business with respect to, or the lack of commercial success of, a vehicle model for which Adient is a significant supplier could adversely affect Adient's financial performance.\nAlthough Adient receives purchase orders from its customers, these purchase orders often provide for the supply of a customer's annual requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant, or in some cases, for the supply of a customer's requirements for the life of a particular vehicle model, rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products. In addition, it is possible that Adient's customers could elect to manufacture its products internally or increase the extent to which they require Adient to utilize specific suppliers or materials in the manufacture of its products. The loss of business with respect to, the lack of commercial success of or an increase in directed component sourcing for a vehicle model for which Adient is a significant supplier could reduce Adient's sales or margins and thereby adversely affect Adient's financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nShifts in market shares among vehicles, vehicle segments or shifts away from vehicles on which Adient has significant content or overall changes in consumer demand could have an adverse effect on Adient's profitability.\nWhile Adient supplies parts for a wide variety of vehicles produced globally, Adient does not supply parts for all vehicles produced, nor is the number or value of parts evenly distributed among the vehicles for which Adient does supply parts. Shifts in market shares among vehicles or vehicle segments, including as a result of the autonomous vehicle market, particularly shifts away from vehicles on which Adient has significant content and shifts away from vehicle segments in which Adient's sales may be more heavily concentrated, could have an adverse effect on Adient's profitability. Similarly, certain vehicles or vehicle segments Adient supplies may be disproportionately impacted by overall industry disruptions such that Adients sales may be adversely effected relative to the industry in general or our competitors, which could have a negative effect on Adients business. Increases in energy costs or other factors (e.g., climate change concerns) may also shift consumer demand away from motor vehicles that typically have higher interior content that Adient supplies, such as light trucks, crossover vehicles, minivans and sports utility vehicles, to smaller vehicles having less interior content. The loss of business with respect to, or a lack of commercial success of, one or more particular vehicle models for which Adient is a significant supplier could reduce Adient's sales and harm Adient's profitability, thereby adversely affecting Adient's results of operations.\nAdient may not pay dividends on its ordinary shares, which may impact Adients investor base.\nAdient currently does not have plans to pay dividends on its ordinary shares. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to shareholders will fall within the discretion of Adient's board of directors. The board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as Adient's financial condition, earnings, sufficiency of distributable reserves, capital requirements, debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant. Adient's ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets. Adient cannot guarantee that it will pay dividends in the future which may impact Adients investor base.\nA variety of other factors could adversely affect Adient's results of operations.\nAny of the following could adversely impact Adient's results of operations: the inability of Adient to execute continued turnaround actions to improve profitability; the loss of, or changes in, automobile supply contracts, sourcing strategies or customer claims with Adient's major customers or suppliers; increased freight or shipping costs resulting from extreme weather conditions or supply chain disruptions, lack of commodity availability and unfavorable commodity pricing; start-up expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellations of such programs; underutilization of Adient's manufacturing facilities, which are generally located near, and devoted to, a particular customer's facility; inability to recover engineering and tooling costs; market and financial consequences of any recalls that may be required on products that Adient has supplied or sold into the automotive aftermarket; delays or difficulties in new product development and integration; quantity and complexity of new program launches, which are subject to Adient's customers' timing, performance, design and quality standards; interruption of supply of certain single-source components; the potential introduction of similar or superior technologies; changing nature and prevalence of Adient's joint ventures and relationships with its strategic business partners; global overcapacity and vehicle platform proliferation; and the implementation of new internal control systems and procedures that fail to achieve accurate financial reporting or that fail to prevent fraudulent activity (such as vendor payments to fraudulent bank accounts).\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 23\nRisks Related to Adients Jurisdiction of Incorporation\nAs an Irish public limited company, certain capital structure decisions require shareholder approval, which may limit Adient's flexibility to manage its capital structure.\nIrish law provides that a board of directors may allot shares (or rights to subscribe for or convertible into shares) only with the prior authorization of shareholders. At our most recent Annual General Meeting, Adient's shareholders renewed this authorization for a period of 18 months (unless previously renewed, varied or revoked). This authorization will need to be further renewed by ordinary resolution, being a resolution passed by a simple majority of votes cast, prior to expiration. We anticipate seeking another authorization at our next Annual General Meeting and annually thereafter. Should this authorization not be approved, our ability to issue equity could be limited which could adversely affect our securities holders.\nIrish law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash; however, it is possible for shareholders to vote to exclude preemptive rights in a general meeting. At our most recent Annual General Meeting, Adient's shareholders renewed this authorization for a period of 18 months (unless previously renewed, varied or revoked). This authorization will need to be renewed by special resolution, being a resolution passed by not less than 75% of votes cast, upon expiration. We anticipate seeking another authorization at our next Annual General Meeting and annually thereafter. Should this authorization not be approved, our ability to issue equity could be limited which could adversely affect our securities holders.\nThe laws of Ireland differ from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of Adient securities.\nIt may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against Adient in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against Adient or its directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against Adient or those persons based on those laws. The U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters in Ireland. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland.\nA judgment obtained against Adient will be enforced by the courts of Ireland if the following general requirements are met: (i) U.S. courts must have had jurisdiction in relation to the particular defendant according to Irish conflict of law rules (the submission to jurisdiction by the defendant would satisfy this rule) and (ii) the judgment must be final and conclusive and the decree must be final and unalterable in the court which pronounces it. A judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if an appeal is pending. Where however the effect of lodging an appeal under the applicable law is to stay execution of the judgment, it is possible that in the meantime the judgment may not be actionable in Ireland. It remains to be determined whether final judgment given in default of appearance is final and conclusive. However, Irish courts may refuse to enforce a judgment of the U.S. courts which meets the above requirements for one of the following reasons: (i) if the judgment is not for a definite sum of money; (ii) if the judgment was obtained by fraud; (iii) the enforcement of the judgment in Ireland would be contrary to natural or constitutional justice; (iv) the judgment is contrary to Irish public policy or involves certain U.S. laws which will not be enforced in Ireland; or (v) jurisdiction cannot be obtained by the Irish courts over the judgment debtors in the enforcement proceedings by personal service in Ireland or outside Ireland under Order 11 of the Ireland Superior Courts Rules.\nAs an Irish company, Adient is governed by the Irish Companies Act 2014, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to Adient only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of Adient and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of Adient only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of Adient's securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S.\nIn addition, the Adient articles of association provide that the Irish courts have exclusive jurisdiction to determine any and all derivative actions in which a holder of Adient ordinary shares asserts a claim in the name of Adient, actions asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty of any of the directors of Adient and actions asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of Irish law or Adient's articles of association. Under Irish law, the proper claimant for wrongs committed against Adient, including by the Adient directors, is considered to be Adient itself. Irish law permits a shareholder to initiate a lawsuit on behalf of a company such as Adient only in limited circumstances, and requires court permission to do so.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 24\nAdients effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of changes in tax laws, mix of earnings and other factors.\nA change in tax laws is one of many factors that impact Adients effective tax rate. The U.S. Congress, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and other government agencies in jurisdictions where Adient and its affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of base erosion and profit shifting, including situations where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. As a result, the tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which Adient and its affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely impact Adient and its affiliates, including potential adverse impacts to Adient's effective tax rate.\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA) into law. The corporate tax provisions include (a) the creation of a 15% corporate minimum tax, effective for Adients fiscal year 2024, and (b) a nondeductible 1% excise tax on share buy-backs of covered corporations, effective for stock repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022. Based upon current IRS guidance and Adient income levels, Adient does not expect to be subject to either provision. However, Adient will continue to monitor and reassess the impact, if any, as the IRS and U.S. Treasury issue additional guidance on the IRA provisions. Given the current political environment, it is uncertain whether additional U.S. corporate tax reform could be expected. There are a number of corporate income tax topics that were not addressed in the IRA that could be raised in the future, for example: increasing the U.S. corporate tax rate, increasing the rate of tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries (the corporate minimum tax), modifying the base erosion and anti-abuse tax rules to target outbound payments to low-taxed jurisdictions, and further limiting interest expense deductibility. If any or all of these (or similar) proposals are ultimately enacted into law, in whole or in part, Adients effective tax rate could be negatively impacted.\nIn 2021, the OECD released a framework for the fundamental reform of international tax rules. The framework provides for two primary Pillars; however, only Pillar Two, which provides for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, is expected to be applicable to Adient (Pillar One is not expected to be applicable as Adient does not currently meet the turnover threshold - EUR 20 billion). In December 2022, Pillar Two was adopted by the Council of the European Union for implementation by European Union member states by December 31, 2023, with effect for tax years beginning in calendar year 2024 (Adients 2025 fiscal year). Similar directives under Pillar Two are already adopted or expected to be adopted by taxing authorities in other countries where Adient does business, with widespread implementation of the global minimum tax in calendar years 2024 and 2025. The OECD, and its member countries, continue to release new guidance on these rules and Adient is continuously evaluating the impact to its financial position. Currently, the global enactment of Pillar Two is not expected to materially impact Adients effective tax rate or cash flows. However, Adient will continue to monitor and evaluate new legislation and guidance, which could change our current assessment.\nCurrently, Adient incurs losses in certain countries where it does not receive a financial statement benefit, and Adient operates in countries which have different statutory rates. Consequently, changes in the mix and source of earnings between countries could have a material impact on Adients overall effective tax rate.\nLegislative and other proposals that would deny governmental contracts to U.S. companies that move their corporate location abroad may affect Adient if adopted.\nVarious U.S. federal and state legislative and other proposals that would deny governmental contracts to U.S. companies (and subsidiaries of U.S. companies) that move (or have moved) their corporate location abroad may affect Adient and/or its affiliates if adopted. It is difficult to predict the likelihood that any such proposals might be adopted, the nature of the regulations that might be promulgated, or the effect such adoptions and increased regulatory scrutiny might have on Adient's business.\nAdient's status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes could be affected by a change in law.\nUnder current law, Adient is expected to be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes and Section 7874 is not otherwise expected to apply to Adient or its affiliates as a result of the separation from Johnson Controls International plc (the Former Parent) in 2016. However, changes to the rules contained in Section 7874 and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or other changes in law, could adversely affect Adient's and/or its affiliates' status as foreign corporations for U.S. federal tax purposes, the ability of Adient's U.S. affiliates to use certain attributes or deductions, the Adient group's effective tax rate and/or future tax planning for the Adient group, and any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application to Adient, its shareholders and affiliates, and/or the separation and distribution from the Former Parent.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 25\nRecent legislative and other proposals have aimed to expand the scope of U.S. corporate tax residence. Under such proposals, Adient and/or its affiliates could be treated as U.S. corporations if the management and control of Adient or such affiliates were determined to be located primarily in the U.S. In addition, recent legislative and other proposals have aimed to expand the scope of Section 7874, or otherwise address certain perceived issues arising in connection with so-called inversion transactions. Such proposals, if made retroactively effective to transactions completed during the period in which the separation from the Former Parent occurred, could cause Adient and/or its affiliates to be treated as U.S. corporations for U.S federal tax purposes. If enacted, these proposals could cause the Adient group to be subject to substantially greater U.S. tax liability than currently contemplated.\nPotential indemnification liabilities to Adients former parent company pursuant to the separation agreement could adversely affect Adient.\nThe separation arrangements with the Former Parent company provide for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to effect the separation, certain conditions to the separation and provisions governing the relationship between Adient and the Former Parent company with respect to and resulting from the separation, including ongoing relationships. Among other things, the separation arrangements provide for indemnification obligations designed to make Adient financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the separation, as well as those obligations of the Former Parent assumed by Adient pursuant to the separation arrangements and in respect of the conduct of the parties post-separation. Adient may be subject to substantial liabilities under these indemnifications.\nTransfers of Adient ordinary shares, other than by means of the transfer of book-entry interests in the Depository Trust Company, may be subject to Irish stamp duty.\nIt is expected that, for the majority of transfers of Adient ordinary shares, there will not be any Irish stamp duty. Transfers of Adient ordinary shares effected by means of the transfer of book-entry interests in the Depository Trust Company, which we refer to as DTC, are not subject to Irish stamp duty. But if Adient ordinary shares are held directly rather than beneficially through DTC, any transfer of Adient ordinary shares could be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired). A shareholder who directly holds Adient ordinary shares may transfer those shares into his or her own broker account to be held through DTC (or vice versa) without giving rise to Irish stamp duty provided that there is no change in the beneficial ownership of the shares as a result of the transfer and the transfer is not in contemplation of a sale of the shares by a beneficial owner to a third party.\nPayment of Irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee. The potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of Adient ordinary shares.\nCertain provisions in Adient's articles of association, among other things, could prevent or delay an acquisition of Adient, which could decrease the trading price of Adient ordinary shares.\nAdients articles of association include measures that may be found in the charters of U.S. companies and that could have the effect of deterring coercive takeover practices, inadequate takeover bids and unsolicited offers. These provisions include, among others: (i) the power for the board of directors to issue and allot preferred shares or implement a shareholder rights plan without shareholder approval in certain circumstances; (ii) a provision similar to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15 percent of the outstanding ordinary shares of Adient shall not engage in any business combination with Adient, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 percent of Adient's outstanding ordinary shares; (iii) rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings; and (iv) the ability of the Adient board of directors to fill vacancies on the board of directors in certain circumstances.\nIt could be difficult for Adient to obtain shareholder approval for a merger or negotiated transaction because the shareholder approval requirements for certain types of transactions differ, and in some cases are greater, under Irish law than under U.S. state law.\nIn addition, several mandatory provisions of Irish law could prevent or delay an acquisition of Adient. For example, Adient will be subject to various provisions of Irish law relating to mandatory bids, voluntary bids, requirements to make a cash offer and minimum price requirements, as well as substantial acquisition rules and rules requiring the disclosure of interests in Adient ordinary shares in certain circumstances. Also, Irish companies, including Adient, may only alter their memorandum of\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 26\nassociation and articles of association with the approval of the holders of at least 75% of Adient's shares present and voting in person or by proxy at a general meeting of Adient (and certain provisions of Adient's memorandum of association and articles of association may only be amended with the approval of the holders of at least 80% in nominal value of Adient's issued ordinary shares).\nIrish law requires that Adient meet certain additional financial requirements before it declares dividends.\nUnder Irish law, Adient will be able to declare dividends and make distributions only out of \"distributable reserves.\" Distributable reserves are the accumulated realized profits of Adient that have not previously been utilized in a distribution or capitalization less accumulated realized losses that have not previously been written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital, and include reserves created by way of a reduction of capital, including the share premium account. In addition, no distribution or dividend may be paid or made by Adient unless the net assets of Adient are equal to, or exceed, the aggregate of Adient's called up share capital plus non-distributable reserves and the distribution does not reduce Adient's net assets below such aggregate. Non-distributable reserves include the share premium account, the capital redemption reserve fund and the amount by which Adient's accumulated unrealized profits that have not been previously utilized by any capitalization exceed Adient's accumulated unrealized losses that have not previously been written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nNot applicable. Item 2. Properties\nThe following table sets forth Adient's principal owned and leased facilities as of September 30, 2023.\nNumber of Locations\nOperations Administrative\nOwned Leased Total Owned Leased Total\nUnited States 20 10 30 2 2 4\nMexico 9 9 18 - 2 2\nGermany 4 8 12 2 6 8\nThailand 3 14 17 - - -\nChina 5 18 23 - 3 3\nCzech Republic 3 5 8 - 1 1\nJapan 5 2 7 1 1 2\nOther EMEA 24 27 51 - 9 9\nOther Asia 6 22 28 - 4 4\nOther Americas 7 3 10 - - -\n86 118 204 5 28 33\nAdient considers its facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used and do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. See Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Note 8, \"Leases,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding lease commitments.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 27 Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nAdient is involved in various lawsuits, claims and proceedings incident to the operation of its businesses, including those pertaining to product liability, product safety, environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment, commercial, contractual and various other matters. Although the outcome of any such lawsuit, claim or proceeding cannot be predicted with certainty and some may be disposed of unfavorably to Adient, it is management's opinion that none of these will have a material adverse effect on Adient's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Adient accrues for potential liabilities in a manner consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, that is, when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 28\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nPrincipal Market\nAdient's ordinary shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol ADNT.\nHolders\nAs of September 30, 2023, there were 23,057 shareholders of record.\nDividends\nAdient suspended its cash dividends following the dividend paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Any future dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon Adient's financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, alternative uses of capital and other factors the board of directors may consider at its discretion. In addition, under Irish law, dividends and distributions (including the payment of cash dividends or share repurchases) may be made only from \"distributable reserves\" on Adient's unconsolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with the Irish Companies Act 2014. In addition, no distribution or dividend may be paid or made by Adient unless the net assets of Adient are equal to, or exceed, the aggregate of Adient's share capital that has been paid up or that is payable in the future plus non-distributable reserves, and the distribution does not reduce Adient's net assets below such aggregate.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities\nNone.\nRepurchases of Equity Securities\nIn November 2022, Adients board of directors authorized the repurchase of Adients ordinary shares up to an aggregate purchase price of $600 million with no expiration date. Under the share repurchase authorization, Adients ordinary shares may be purchased either through discretionary purchases on the open market, by block trades or privately negotiated transactions. The number of ordinary shares repurchased, if any, and the timing of repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including share price, trading volume and general market conditions, as well as on working capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors. During fiscal 2023, Adient repurchased $65 million of its ordinary shares at an average price of $37.00 a share under the program. As of September 30, 2023, Adient has a remaining repurchase authorization of $535 million.\nThere was no share repurchase activity during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nStock Performance Graph\nThe following information in this Item 5 is not deemed to be soliciting material or to be filed with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A or 14C under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent Adient specifically incorporates it by reference into such a filing.\nThe following graph shows a comparison of cumulative total shareholder return, calculated on a dividend reinvested basis, for Adients ordinary shares, the Standard & Poors 500 Index, and a peer group for September 30, 2018 through September 30, 2023. The graph assumes the value of the investment in Adient's ordinary shares and each index was $100 on September 30, 2018, and that all dividends were reinvested. Historic stock price performance is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance. Adient selected a peer group comprised of representative independent automotive suppliers whose common stock is publicly traded.

All information presented herein is based on Adient's fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to Adient's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. The forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K are made only as of the date of this report, unless otherwise specified, and, except as required by law, Adient assumes no obligation, and disclaims any obligation, to update such statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nAdient is a global leader in the automotive seating supply industry with relationships with the largest global auto manufacturers. Adient's technologies extend into virtually every area of automotive seating solutions, including complete seating systems, frames, mechanisms, foam, head restraints, armrests and trim covers. Adient is an independent seat supplier with global scale and the capability to design, develop, engineer, manufacture and deliver complete seat systems and components in every major automotive producing region in the world.\nAdient designs, manufactures and markets a full range of seating systems and components for passenger cars, commercial vehicles and light trucks, including vans, pick-up trucks and sport/crossover utility vehicles. Adient operates more than 200 wholly- and majority-owned manufacturing or assembly facilities, with operations in 29 countries. Additionally, Adient has partially-owned affiliates in China, Asia, Europe and North America. Through its global footprint and vertical integration, Adient leverages its capabilities to drive growth in the automotive seating industry.\nAdient manages its business on a geographic basis and operates in the following three reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: 1) Americas, which is inclusive of North America and South America; 2) Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and 3) Asia Pacific/China (Asia).\nAdient evaluates the performance of its reportable segments using an adjusted EBITDA metric defined as income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, excluding net financing charges, restructuring and impairment costs, restructuring related-costs, net mark-to-market adjustments on pension and postretirement plans, transaction gains/losses, purchase accounting amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation and other non-recurring items (Adjusted EBITDA). Also, certain corporate-related costs are not allocated to the segments. The reportable segments are consistent with how management views the markets served by Adient and reflect the financial information that is reviewed by its chief operating decision maker. Refer to Note 17, \"Segment Information,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on Adient's reportable segments.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 31\nFactors Affecting Adients Operating Environment\nAdient, along with the automotive industry, has experienced significant volatility over the past few years relative to supply chain constraints causing disruptions to customer production schedules, inflationary pressures on raw materials and energy prices, wage inflation caused by constrained labor availability, impacts from geopolitical uncertainties such as the Russia/Ukraine conflict, higher interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. Although supply chain conditions have steadily improved and certain inflationary pressures have moderated throughout fiscal year 2023, Adient continues to face uncertainties associated with a fragile supply chain environment, rising interest rates and wage inflationary pressures (as evidenced by the UAW strike in the U.S. that started in September 2023), among other macroeconomic factors. Refer to the consolidated results of operations and segment analysis discussion below for additional information on the impacts of these items on Adient's results.\nGlobal Automotive Industry\nAdient conducts its business globally in the automotive industry, which is highly competitive and sensitive to economic, political and social factors in the various regions. During fiscal 2023, global light vehicle production increased 7.6% year over year driven by improved production volumes in all regions along with a moderation of supply chain disruptions and certain inflationary factors. The global automotive industry is expecting modest volume growth in the coming year, continues to operate within a fragile supply chain environment and will likely continue to experience inflationary pressures such as wage inflation (as evidenced by the UAW strike in the U.S. that started in September 2023), geopolitical uncertainties, higher interest rates and foreign currency volatility.\nLight vehicle production levels by geographic region are provided below:\nLight Vehicle Production\n(units in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021\nGlobal 87.8 7.6 % 81.6 2.6 % 79.5\nNorth America 15.5 9.9 % 14.1 3.7 % 13.6\nSouth America 3.0 7.1 % 2.8 3.7 % 2.7\nEurope 17.5 12.2 % 15.6 -9.8 % 17.3\nChina 27.3 2.2 % 26.7 7.2 % 24.9\nAsia, excluding China, and Other 24.5 9.4 % 22.4 6.7 % 21.0\nSource: S&P Global, October 2023\nFinancial Results Summary\nSignificant aspects of Adient's financial results for fiscal 2023 are summarized below. Adient's financial results for fiscal 2021 include the strategic transactions in China which had a significant impact on the fiscal 2021 financial results. Refer to Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures, in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on these transactions.\nAdient recorded net sales of $15,395 million for fiscal 2023, representing an increase of $1,274 million when compared to fiscal 2022. The increase in net sales is attributable to higher overall production volumes in all operating segments and favorable pricing, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies and unfavorable material economics recoveries.\nGross profit was $1,033 million, or 6.7% of net sales for fiscal 2023 compared to $807 million, or 5.7% of net sales for fiscal 2022. Profitability, including gross profit as a percentage of net sales, was higher due to higher production volumes and favorable pricing, insurance recoveries and favorable business performance, partially offset by unfavorable impacts of material economics.\nEquity income was $84 million for fiscal 2023, which compares to equity income of $75 million for fiscal 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to higher overall production volumes at Adient's partially-owned affiliates in all regions, partially offset by the impact of KEIPER supply agreement modifications executed over the past two fiscal years, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 32\nNet income attributable to Adient was $205 million for fiscal 2023, compared to a loss of $120 million for fiscal 2022. The net income in fiscal 2023 is primarily attributable to higher overall production volumes, favorable pricing and business performance, one-time insurance recoveries, one-time income tax benefit related to the release of certain tax valuation allowances, lower selling, general and administrative expenses, lower net financing charges, and higher equity income, partially offset by unfavorable material economics, higher other pension expense, higher restructuring cost, higher income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021\nNet sales $ 15,395 9% $ 14,121 3% $ 13,680\nCost of sales 14,362 8% 13,314 4% 12,854\nGross profit 1,033 28% 807 (2)% 826\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 554 (7)% 598 11% 537\nRestructuring and impairment costs 40 60% 25 19% 21\nEquity income (loss) 84 12% 75 (95)% 1,484\nEarnings (loss) before interest and income taxes 523 >100% 259 (85)% 1,726\nNet financing charges 195 (9)% 215 (31)% 311\nOther pension expense (income) 33 >100% (10) 58% (24)\nIncome (loss) before income taxes 295 >100% 54 (96)% 1,439\nIncome tax provision (benefit) - n/a 94 (62)% 249\nNet income (loss) 295 >100% (40) >(100%) 1,190\nIncome (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 90 13% 80 (2)% 82\nNet income (loss) attributable to Adient $ 205 >100% $ (120) >(100%) $ 1,108\nNet Sales\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021\nNet sales $ 15,395 9% $ 14,121 3% $ 13,680\nNet sales increased by $1,274 million, or 9%, in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 due to higher overall production volumes in all operating segments ($1,558 million) and net favorable pricing adjustments ($141 million), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies ($301 million) and unfavorable material economics recoveries ($124 million).\nNet sales increased by $441 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to operational footprint changes primarily related to the consolidation of CQADNT in China ($620 million), favorable material economics recoveries ($312 million), and higher overall production volumes despite certain unplanned production stoppages resulting from semiconductor chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions, and despite the impact of the Russia/Ukraine conflict on EMEA production volumes and localized COVID-19 lockdowns in China ($90 million), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies ($568 million) and unfavorable net pricing adjustments ($13 million).\nRefer to the segment analysis below for a discussion of segment net sales.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 33\nCost of Sales / Gross Profit\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021\nCost of sales $ 14,362 8% $ 13,314 4% $ 12,854\nGross profit 1,033 28% 807 (2)% 826\n% of sales 6.7 % 5.7 % 6.0 %\nCost of sales increased by $1,048 million, or 8%, and gross profit increased by $226 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. The year-over-year increase in cost of sales was due to higher production volumes ($1,312 million), increased utilities and labor costs along with operating inefficiencies associated with supply chain issues ($104 million), and the impact of prior year gains associated with retrospective recoveries of Brazil indirect tax credits ($29 million), partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currencies ($282 million), favorable supplier pricing ($69 million), non-recurring current year net benefits largely associated with insurance recoveries ($29 million), the favorable impact of the KEIPER supply agreement modifications ($11 million), and lower depreciation expense ($6 million). Gross profit was favorably impacted by higher overall production volumes, net favorable pricing adjustments, and non-recurring net benefits largely associated with insurance recoveries, partially offset by higher utilities and labor costs, and unfavorable net material economics.\nCost of sales increased by $460 million, or 4%, and gross profit decreased by $19 million in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. The year-over-year increase in cost of sales was due primarily to operational footprint changes related to the consolidation of CQADNT in China ($527 million), higher input costs including higher energy cost in EMEA as a result of the Russia/Ukraine conflict ($327 million), higher overall production volumes ($136 million), operational inefficiencies resulting from unplanned production stoppages including higher freight ($74 million), net impact of gains associated with retrospective recoveries of Brazil indirect tax credits ($5 million), and higher depreciation and amortization expense ($6 million), partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currencies ($542 million), and favorable supplier pricing including the impact of a modified pricing agreement with KEIPER ($71 million). Gross profit was unfavorably impacted by foreign currencies, higher input costs, and inefficiencies caused by unplanned production stoppages, partially offset by operational footprint changes primarily related to the consolidation of CQADNT in China.\nRefer to the segment analysis below for a discussion of segment profitability.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021\nSelling, general and administrative expenses $ 554 (7)% $ 598 11% $ 537\n% of sales 3.6 % 4.2 % 3.9 %\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) in fiscal 2023 decreased by $44 million, or 7%, as compared to fiscal 2022. The-year-over year decrease in SG&A is attributable to the favorable impact of foreign currencies ($12 million), one-time gain on sale of a restructured facility ($10 million), lower transaction costs ($5 million), non-recurring unfavorable prior year costs ($17 million), lower overall engineering and other administrative spending ($15 million), and lower depreciation and amortization expense ($4 million), partially offset by higher compensation expense including stock-based and performance-based incentive compensation costs due in part to the non-recurrence of prior year austerity measures ($19 million).\nSG&A in fiscal 2022 increased by $61 million as compared to fiscal 2021. The year-over-year increase in SG&A is attributable to higher overall engineering and other administrative spending in the current year ($36 million), the impact of the fiscal 2021 acquisitions and consolidations of CQADNT and LFADNT ($35 million), the impact of a non-recurring contract related settlement with a customer ($14 million), higher depreciation expense ($7 million), and higher amortization expense attributable to the acquired intangible assets ($7 million). These were offset by lower compensation expense including stock-based and performance-based incentive compensation costs ($12 million), the favorable impact of foreign currencies ($17 million), and lower transaction costs ($11 million).\nRefer to the segment analysis below for a discussion of segment profitability.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 34\nRestructuring and Impairment Costs\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021\nRestructuring and impairment costs $ 40 60% $ 25 19% $ 21\nRestructuring and impairment costs were higher by $15 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 due primarily to higher levels of restructuring actions taken in EMEA.\nRestructuring and impairment charges increased by $4 million in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 due primarily to one-time non-cash impairment charges related to the withdrawal from and sale of Adients operations in Russia and other assets held for sale in EMEA.\nRefer to Note 3, \"Acquisitions and Divestitures,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information related to Adients withdrawal from and sale of operations in Russia and assets held for sale.\nEquity Income\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021\nEquity income (loss) $ 84 12% $ 75 (95)% $ 1,484\nEquity income was $84 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $75 million in fiscal 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to higher production volumes and favorable operating performance at Adient's partially-owned affiliates ($28 million), one-time gain on divestiture of investment at an affiliate ($4 million), and lower non-cash impairment charges recorded on certain of Adient's investments in non-consolidated affiliates ($2 million), partially offset by the impact of the KEIPER supply agreement modifications executed over the past two fiscal years ($17 million), the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies ($7 million), and restructuring-related activities at certain affiliates ($1 million).\nEquity income was $75 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $1,484 million in fiscal 2021. The decrease is primarily attributable to the significant fiscal 2021 gains on divestitures of Adient's interests in certain China joint ventures (YFAS, SJA and others) as well as the fiscal 2021 acquisition of controlling interest in CQADNT and resulting lower equity in fiscal 2022 ($1,376 million), fiscal 2022 non-cash impairment charges recorded on certain of Adient's investments in non-consolidated affiliates in South Africa and China ($10 million), the impact of KEIPER supply agreement modifications ($17 million), the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies ($3 million), higher restructuring charges primarily at Adient's affiliates in China ($5 million), and fiscal 2022 operational interruptions and production stoppages resulting from supply chain disruptions and localized COVID-19 lockdowns in China ($1 million), partially offset by lower purchase accounting amortization ($3 million).\nRefer to Note 3, \"Acquisitions and Divestitures,\" and Note 18, \"Nonconsolidated Partially-Owned Affiliates,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nNet Financing Charges\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021\nNet financing charges $ 195 (9)% $ 215 (31)% $ 311\nNet financing charges decreased by $20 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 due to higher premiums paid to tender outstanding debt in the prior year and higher accelerated expensing of deferred financing costs in the prior year.\nNet financing charges decreased in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 as a result of lower levels of outstanding debt, higher amounts of premiums paid to tender outstanding debt and higher levels of accelerated expense of deferred financing costs in fiscal 2021 associated with the pay-down of debt.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 35\nRefer to Note 9, \"Debt and Financing Arrangements,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the components of Adient's net financing charges.\nOther Pension Expense (Income)\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021\nOther pension expense (income) $ 33 >100% $ (10) 58% $ (24)\nOther pension expense (income) consists of mark-to-market adjustments of Adient's retirement plans and non-service components of Adient's net periodic pension costs. Other pension expense was higher by $43 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 due primarily to a $19 million current year mark-to-market loss (compared to a $8 million gain in fiscal 2022), an $8 million curtailment loss primarily associated with employee termination benefit plans in the Americas segment, and higher pension interest expense. The lower fiscal 2022 (income) compared to fiscal 2021 is due primarily to a lower pension mark-to-market gain ($8 million) and a lower expected return on plan assets ($4 million). Refer to Note 14, \"Retirement Plans,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the components of Adient's net periodic pension costs.\nIncome Tax Provision\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021\nIncome tax provision (benefit) $ - n/a $ 94 (62)% $ 249\nThe fiscal 2023 income tax expense of $0 million was lower than the Irish statutory rate of 12.5% primarily due to the release of valuation allowances in Mexico, partially offset by the inability to recognize a tax benefit for losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances, the repatriation of foreign earnings, and foreign tax rate differentials.\nAdient reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or combined group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered, along with any other positive or negative evidence. All of the factors that Adient considers in evaluating whether and when to establish or release all or a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance involve significant judgment. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to Adient's valuation allowances may be necessary.\nGiven current earnings and anticipated future earnings at certain subsidiaries, Adient believes that there is a reasonable possibility that sufficient positive evidence may become available that would allow the release of all, or a portion of, valuation allowances at certain subsidiaries within the next twelve months. A release of valuation allowances, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets which could generate a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded.\nAs a result of Adient's fiscal 2023 analysis of the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence, Adient determined it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets in Mexico would be realizable and recorded an income tax benefit of $114 million to release valuation allowances. In addition, Adient determined it was necessary to release valuation allowances and establish valuation allowances in other jurisdictions that did not have a material impact on Adients financial statements. Adient continues to record valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Mexico, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom, the U.S. and other jurisdictions as it remains more likely than not that they will not be realized.\nThe fiscal 2022 income tax expense of $94 million was higher than the Irish statutory rate of 12.5% primarily due to the inability to recognize a tax benefit for losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances, the establishment of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, and the repatriation of foreign earnings, partially offset by tax benefits related to the release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 36\nAs a result of Adient's fiscal 2022 analysis of the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence, Adient determined it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets in Canada, Japan, and other jurisdictions would not be realized and recorded income tax expense of $12 million, $3 million and $3 million, respectively, to establish valuation allowances. Additionally, Adient determined it was more likely than not that deferred tax assets in the Czech Republic and other jurisdictions would be realizable and recorded income tax benefit of $11 million and $2 million, respectively, to release valuation allowances.\nThe fiscal 2021 income tax expense of $249 million was higher than the Irish statutory rate of 12.5% primarily due to the inability to recognize a tax benefit for losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances, the establishment of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, and the repatriation of foreign earnings, partially offset by tax benefits from audit settlements, the write-off of deferred tax liabilities related to withholding taxes, and withholding taxes on the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction at a rate lower than the Irish statutory rate of 12.5%.\nAs a result of Adient's fiscal 2021 analysis of the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence, Adient determined it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets in the Czech Republic, Korea, Mexico, and other jurisdictions would not be realized and recorded income tax expense of $5 million, $5 million, $8 million, and $4 million, respectively, to establish valuation allowances.\nAdient is subject to income taxes in Ireland, the U.S. and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of Adient's business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Adient's income tax returns for various fiscal years remain under audit by the respective tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.\nAdient does not generally provide for additional income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. Adient's intent is for such earnings to be reinvested by the subsidiaries or to be repatriated only when it would be tax efficient.\nIncome Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021\nIncome attributable to noncontrolling interests $ 90 13% $ 80 (2)% $ 82\nThe $10 million increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interests in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 is primarily attributable to higher production volumes at affiliates in various jurisdictions.\nThe $2 million decrease in income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2022 is attributable to lower income due to operational inefficiencies resulting from unplanned production stoppages including higher freight at affiliates in various jurisdictions.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Adient\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021\nNet income (loss) attributable to Adient $ 205 >100% $ (120) >(100%) $ 1,108\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 37\nNet income attributable to Adient was $205 million in fiscal 2023, compared to $120 million of net loss attributable to Adient in fiscal 2022. The higher net income in fiscal 2023 is primarily attributable to higher overall production volumes, favorable pricing and business performance, one-time insurance recoveries, one-time income tax benefit related to the release of certain tax valuation allowances, lower SG&A expenses, lower net financing charges, and higher equity income, partially offset by unfavorable material economics, higher other pension expense, higher restructuring cost, higher income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies.\nNet loss attributable to Adient was $120 million for fiscal 2022, compared to net income attributable to Adient of $1,108 million for fiscal 2021. The fiscal 2022 net loss attributable to Adient is primarily due to lower equity income attributable to fiscal 2021 one-time gains on divestitures of Adient's interests in certain China joint ventures as described above, fiscal 2022 operational inefficiencies resulting from unplanned production stoppages including higher freight and other supply chain disruptions, the impact of the Russia/Ukraine conflict on EMEA production volumes and higher energy costs, the impact of localized COVID-19 lockdowns in China, and higher overall engineering and other administrative spending, partially offset by the favorable impact of operational footprint changes primarily related to the consolidation of CQADNT in China, favorable material economics recoveries, lower net financing charges, and lower income tax expense.\nComprehensive Income Attributable to Adient\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021\nComprehensive income (loss) attributable to Adient $ 208 >100% $ (338) >(100%) $ 1,146\nComprehensive income attributable to Adient was $208 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $338 million of comprehensive loss in fiscal 2022. The increase of $546 million is due primarily to higher net income ($335 million), the favorable impact of foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the overall weakening of U.S. dollar against certain other major currencies ($233 million) and the impact of realized and unrealized gains on derivatives ($21 million), partially offset by higher comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests ($42 million).\nComprehensive loss attributable to Adient was $338 million for fiscal 2022 compared to comprehensive income attributable to Adient for fiscal 2021 of $1,146 million. The comprehensive loss in fiscal 2022 is attributable to lower net income due to fiscal 2021 one-time gains on the divestitures of Adients interest in certain China joint ventures ($1,230 million), the unfavorable impact in foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from overall strengthening of U.S. dollar against virtually all other currencies ($266 million), less favorable impact in realized and unrealized losses on derivatives ($20 million), partially offset by the decrease in comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests ($32 million).\nSegment Analysis\nAdient manages its business on a geographic basis and operates in the following three reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: 1) Americas, which is inclusive of North America and South America; 2) EMEA and 3) Asia.\nAdient evaluates the performance of its reportable segments using an adjusted EBITDA metric defined as income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, excluding net financing charges, restructuring and impairment costs, restructuring related-costs, net mark-to-market adjustments on pension and postretirement plans, transaction gains/losses, purchase accounting amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation and other non-recurring items. Also, certain corporate-related\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 38\ncosts are not allocated to the segments.

including working capital, capital expenditures, restructuring costs and debt service requirements. Adient's principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, the revolving credit facility and other debt issuances, and existing cash balances. Adient actively manages its working capital and associated cash requirements and continually seeks more effective uses of cash. During fiscal 2023, Adient also announced a share repurchase authorization (up to $600 million) with no expiration date, wherein Adient expects to take a measured approach as to the timing and amount of share repurchases as part of its assessment of the most effective use of cash. Working capital is highly influenced by the timing of cash flows associated with sales and purchases, and therefore can be difficult to manage at times. See below and refer to Note 9, \"Debt and Financing Arrangements,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of financing arrangements. Refer to Note 3, \"Acquisitions and Divestitures,\" for more information on strategic transactions that have provided significant liquidity that allowed for additional voluntary debt pay down in fiscal 2022 and 2021. Following the first quarter of fiscal 2019 dividend payout, Adient suspended future dividends. Adient believes that its current financials resources will be sufficient to fund its liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months.\nIndebtedness\nAdient US LLC (Adient US), a wholly owned subsidiary of Adient, together with certain of Adient's other subsidiaries, maintains an asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Facility), which provides for a revolving line of credit up to $1,250 million, including a North American subfacility of up to $950 million and a European subfacility of up to $300 million, subject to borrowing base capacity and certain other restrictions, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The ABL Credit Facility, as amended in November 2022, is set to mature on November 2, 2027, subject to certain springing maturity provisions. Adient paid $7 million in debt issuance costs for the amended ABL Credit Facility and will pay a commitment fee of 0.25% to 0.375% on the unused portion of the commitments under the asset-based revolving credit facility based on average global availability. Letters of credit are limited to the lesser of (x) $150 million and (y) the aggregate unused amount of commitments under the ABL Credit Facility then in effect. Subject to certain conditions, the ABL Credit Facility may be expanded by up to $250 million in additional commitments. Loans under the ABL Credit Facility may be denominated, at the option of Adient, in U.S. dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling or Swedish Kroner. It also provides flexibility for future amendments to the ABL Facility to incorporate certain sustainability-based pricing provisions. The ABL Credit Agreement is secured on a first-priority lien on all accounts receivable, inventory and bank accounts (and funds on deposit therein) and a second-priority lien on all of the tangible and intangible assets of certain Adient subsidiaries. Interest is payable on the ABL Credit Facility at a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to Term SOFR, in the case of amounts outstanding in dollars, EURIBOR, in the case of amounts outstanding in euros, STIBOR, in the case of amounts outstanding in Swedish krona and SONIA, in the case of amounts outstanding in pounds sterling, in each case, plus an applicable margin of 1.50% to 2.00%. As of September 30, 2023, Adient had not drawn down on the ABL Credit Facility and had availability under this facility of approximately $900 million (net of $12 million of letters of credit).\nIn addition, Adient US and Adient Global Holdings S.\u00e0 r.l., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adient, maintain a senior secured term loan facility (the Term Loan B Agreement) that had an outstanding balance of $988 million as of September 30, 2022. During fiscal 2023, Adient prepaid $350 million of the Term Loan B Agreement principal, and wrote off $2 million of previously deferred financing costs to net financing charges. As of September 30, 2023, the remaining balance of this debt was $635 million, maintained fully at Adient Global Holdings S.\u00e0 r.l., which is due at final maturity on April 8, 2028. Interest on the Term Loan B Agreement accrues at the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin equal to 3.25%. The Term Loan B Agreement also permits Adient to incur incremental term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of $750 million and an unlimited amount subject to a pro forma first lien secured net leverage ratio of not greater than 1.75 to 1.00 and certain other conditions. In April 2023, the Term Loan B Agreement was amended to replace the LIBOR base rate with Term SOFR.\nThe ABL Credit Facility and Term Loan B Agreement contain covenants that are usual and customary for facilities and debt instruments of this type and that, among other things, restrict the ability of Adient and its restricted subsidiaries to: create certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee certain indebtedness; pay dividends or make other distributions on, or repurchase or redeem, Adients capital stock or certain other debt; make other restricted payments; and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of Adients and its restricted subsidiaries assets, to another person. These covenants are subject to a number of other limitations and exceptions set forth in the agreements. The agreements also provide for customary events of default, including, but not limited to, cross-default clauses with other debt arrangements, failure to pay principal and interest, failure to comply with covenants, agreements or conditions, and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency involving Adient and its significant subsidiaries.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 42\nDuring fiscal 2023, Adient Global Holdings Ltd. (AGH), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adient, issued (i) $500 million (net proceeds of $494 million) in aggregate principal amount of 7% senior secured notes due 2028 and (ii) $500 million (net proceeds of $494 million) in aggregate principal amount of 8.250% senior unsecured notes due 2031. Interest on both of these notes will be paid on April 15 and October 15 each year, beginning on October 15, 2023. These notes contain covenants that are usual and customary. The total net proceeds of $988 million along with cash on hand were used primarily to redeem $350 million of the senior secured term loan facility under the Term Loan B Agreement as described above, and repurchase \u20ac700 million ($743 million) of the 3.50% unsecured notes due 2024 as described below. Adient paid $16 million in debt issuance costs for these new debt issuances.\nAGH previously maintained $900 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% USD-denominated unsecured notes due 2026. Adient redeemed $103 million and $2 million during fiscal 2020 and 2021, respectively, resulting in a remaining balance of $795 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nAGH also previously maintained \u20ac1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.50% unsecured notes due in August 2024. During fiscal 2022, Adient repurchased \u20ac177 million ($198 million) of the 3.50% unsecured notes due 2024 at a premium of \u20ac3 million ($4 million) plus \u20ac3 million ($3 million) of accrued and unpaid interest, and expensed \u20ac1 million ($1 million) of previously deferred financing costs to net financing charges, resulting in a remaining balance of \u20ac823 million ($809 million) as of September 30, 2022. During fiscal 2023, Adient repurchased an additional \u20ac700 million ($743 million) of the 3.50% unsecured notes due 2024 at a premium of \u20ac7 million ($7 million) plus \u20ac3 million ($3 million) of accrued and unpaid interest, and expensed \u20ac2 million ($2 million) of previously deferred financing costs to net financing charges. As of September 30, 2023, the remaining balance of this debt was \u20ac123 million ($130 million) and is classified as current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated statement of financial position.\nAdient Germany Ltd. & Co. KG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Adient, previously maintained \u20ac135 million ($156 million) in an unsecured term loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB) due in 2022. The loan bore interest at the 6-month EURIBOR rate plus 158 basis points. During fiscal 2021, Adient repaid $36 million of the EIB loan, triggered in part by the redemption of debt and the sale of the fabrics business in the prior year. Adient fully repaid the remaining balance of the EIB loan in May 2022 upon its maturity.\nIn April 2020, Adient US issued $600 million (net proceeds of $591 million) aggregate principal amount of 9.00% Senior First Lien Notes due 2025. In fiscal 2022, Adient repurchased the full $600 million of 9.00% Senior First Lien Notes due 2025 at a premium of $34 million plus $19 million of accrued and unpaid interest, and expensed $7 million of previously deferred financing costs to net financing charges.\nSources of Cash Flows\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nCash provided (used) by operating activities $ 667 $ 274 $ 260\nCash provided (used) by investing activities (229) 484 347\nCash provided (used) by financing activities (271) (1,273) (770)\nCapital expenditures (252) (227) (260)\nCash flows from operating activities\nFiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022: The increase in cash flows from operating activities is primarily due to the higher net income attributable to Adient in fiscal 2023 and favorable overall changes to working capital year-over-year due to lower levels of inventory and higher levels of current liabilities. See the working capital section below for further information on changes in working capital.\nFiscal 2022 compared to Fiscal 2021: The increase in operating cash flows is primarily due to favorable changes of trade working capital, specifically lower levels of inventory and restructuring spending, and higher levels of accounts payable, partially offset by higher levels of accounts receivable (net of $137 million of favorable impact from accounts receivable factoring programs). Operating cash flows were also positively impacted by lower interest payments, but were negatively impacted by lapsed non-income related tax deferral programs and lower levels of dividends from nonconsolidated partially-owned affiliates.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 43\nCash flows from investing activities\nFiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022: The increase in cash used by investing activities is primarily related to the non-recurrence of the prior year cash inflows associated with business divestitures including the $651 million of proceeds received related to the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction, $46 million in proceeds received from the sale of the assets in Turkey, and the collection of $41 million of deferred proceeds from the sale of Adient's interest in YFAI as part of the 2020 Yanfeng Transaction. Refer to Note 3, \"Acquisitions and Divestitures,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nFiscal 2022 compared to Fiscal 2021: The increase in cash provided by investing activities is primarily attributable to the $652 million of proceeds received related to the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction, the $46 million in proceeds received from the sale of the assets in Turkey, and the collection of $41 million of deferred proceeds from the sale of Adient's interest in YFAI as part of the 2020 Yanfeng Transaction and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by the $30 million settlement of the derivative contracts related to the cash proceeds of the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction. Refer to Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures, and Note 10, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCash flows from financing activities\nFiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022: The decrease in cash used by financing activities is attributable to prior year financing activities. This includes repayment of long-term debt of $744 million (including $34 million of premiums), amounts paid to acquire the noncontrolling interest of CQADNT ($153 million), and higher dividend payments to noncontrolling interests. These are partially offset by current year debt refinancing activities totaling $102 million and common stock repurchases of $65 million.\nFiscal 2022 compared to Fiscal 2021: The increase in cash used by financing activities is attributable to the repayment of long-term debt, including premiums paid, of $987 million, amounts paid to acquire the noncontrolling interest of CQADNT ($153 million), along with higher dividend payments to noncontrolling interests primarily in connection with the acquisition of CQANDT. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Financing Arrangements, and Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCapital expenditures\nFiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022: A $25 million increase in capital expenditures is primarily associated with new program launches particularly in EMEA and Asia, and additional investments in continuous improvement initiatives in all regions.\nFiscal 2022 compared to Fiscal 2021: Capital expenditures decreased year-over-year based on timing of program spend on product launches and continued tightening of overall spending.\nWorking capital\n(in millions) September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022\nCurrent assets $ 4,316 $ 4,163\nCurrent liabilities 3,738 3,501\nWorking capital $ 578 $ 662\nWorking capital decreased by $84 million due to decreases in inventories and increases in accounts payable and current portion of long-term debt, partially offset by increases in cash and other current assets. All such activity was in line with higher sales and related production volumes in fiscal 2023 or due to contractual related maturities.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 44\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAdient enters into supply chain financing programs in domestic and certain foreign jurisdictions to either sell or discount accounts receivable without recourse to third-party institutions. Sales or discounts of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable on the consolidated statements of financial position and the proceeds are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, $170 million and $269 million have been funded under these programs, respectively.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of Adient's significant contractual obligations as of September 30, 2023:\n(in millions) Total 2024 2025-2026 2027-2028 Beyond 2029\nLong-term debt $ 2,564 $ 132 $ 797 $ 1,135 $ 500\nInterest on long-term debt 875 175 340 236 124\nOperating leases 286 88 104 49 45\nPurchase obligations (1)\n376 251 10 36 79\nPension contributions 100 20 18 16 46\nTotal contractual cash obligations $ 4,201 $ 666 $ 1,269 $ 1,472 $ 794\n(1) Primarily consists of commitments for production materials and other supply items, as well as $102 million of committed capital expenditures.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe effects of inflation have historically not been significant to Adient's results of operations. Generally, Adient has been able to implement operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which over time have been moderate. The automotive industry has recently experienced a period of significant volatility in commodity and other input costs, including steel, petrochemical, freight, energy and labor costs. This price volatility may continue into the future as demand increases and/or supply is constrained. Price volatility has resulted in an overall increase of input costs for Adient that may not be, or may only be partially, offset through customer negotiations. During fiscal 2024, commodity prices and availability could fluctuate throughout the year and significantly affect Adient's results of operations.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nAdient prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following policies are considered by management to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of Adient's consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nRevenue Recognition\nAdient records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery occurs or services are rendered, the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Adient delivers products and records revenue pursuant to commercial agreements with its customers generally in the form of an approved purchase order, including the effects of contractual customer price productivity. Adient does negotiate discrete price changes with its customers, which are generally the result of unique commercial issues between Adient and its customers. Adient records amounts associated with discrete price changes as a reduction to revenue when specific facts and circumstances indicate that a price reduction is probable and the amounts are reasonably estimable. Adient records amounts associated with discrete price changes as an increase to revenue upon execution of a legally enforceable contractual agreement and when collectability is reasonably assured. Refer to Note 1, \"Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" and Note 2, \"Revenue Recognition,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 45\nImpairment of Goodwill, Other Long-lived Assets and Investments in Partially Owned Affiliates\nGoodwill reflects the cost of an acquisition in excess of the fair values assigned to identifiable net assets acquired. Adient reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. Adient performs impairment reviews for its reporting units, which have been determined to be Adient's reportable segments, using a fair value method based on management's judgments and assumptions or third-party valuations. The fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In estimating the fair value, Adient uses the income approach in which discounted cash flow analyses are used to derive estimates of fair value of each reporting unit. Multiples of earnings based on the average of historical, published multiples of earnings of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics are also used in developing estimated fair values. The inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement.\" These calculations contain uncertainties as they require management to make assumptions about market comparables, future cash flows and appropriate discount rates (based on weighted average cost of capital ranging from 17.0% to 20.5% at September 30, 2023) to reflect the risk inherent in the future cash flows and to derive a reasonable enterprise value and related premium.\nThe estimated future cash flows reflect management's latest assumptions of the financial projections based on current and anticipated competitive landscape, including estimates of revenue based on production volumes over the foreseeable future and long-term growth rates, and operating margins based on historical trends and future cost containment activities. The financial projections considered the impact of the various issues causing the volatility in the automotive industry such as wage inflationary pressures and higher interest rates. As a result of the tests, there was no goodwill impairment recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. A change in any of these estimates and assumptions could produce significantly lower fair values of Adients reporting units, which could have a material impact on its results of operations. Refer to Note 6, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nAdient reviews long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets with definite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. Adient conducts its long-lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with ASC 360-10-15, \"Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.\" ASC 360-10-15 requires Adient to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable, an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals. Intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment testing as part of their asset group if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. A considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests. No triggering events were identified during fiscal 2023 and 2022.\nAdient monitors its investments in partially-owned affiliates for indicators of other-than-temporary declines in value on an ongoing basis. If Adient determines that an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred, it recognizes an impairment loss, which is measured as the difference between the recorded book value and the fair value of the investment. Fair value is generally determined using an income approach based on discounted cash flows or negotiated transaction values. During fiscal 2023, Adient concluded that indicators of other-than-temporary impairment were present related to two nonconsolidated partially-owned affiliates, and recorded a $6 million ($3 million in Asia and $3 million in EMEA) non-cash impairment as a result. During fiscal 2022, Adient entered into agreements, whereby Adient would sell its interests in two joint ventures in China held directly by Adient, each of which represented 25% of their total issued and outstanding equity interests, for $3 million. As a result, Adient concluded that indicators of other-than-temporary impairment were present related to the investments in these joint ventures, and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $3 million. Also during fiscal 2022, Adient concluded that indicators of other-than-temporary impairment were present related to a partially-owned affiliate in South Africa as Adient pursued a sale of a portion of its interest in the joint venture and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $6 million. Refer to Note 18, \"Nonconsolidated Partially-Owned Affiliates,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nAdient provides a range of pension benefits to its employees and retired employees. These benefits are Adient's direct obligation and have been recorded within Adient's consolidated financial statements. Plan assets and obligations are measured annually, or more frequently if there is a remeasurement event, based on Adient's measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 46\nrates as of that date. Adient reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate.\nAdient utilizes a mark-to-market approach for recognizing pension benefit expenses, including measuring the market related value of plan assets at fair value and recognizing actuarial gains and losses in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at the date of a remeasurement event.\nU.S. GAAP requires that companies recognize in the statement of financial position a liability for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that are underfunded or unfunded, or an asset for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that are overfunded. U.S. GAAP also requires that companies measure the benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets that determine a benefit plan's funded status as of the date of the employer's fiscal year end.\nAdient considers the expected benefit payments on a plan-by-plan basis when setting assumed discount rates. As a result, Adient uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the plan jurisdiction, the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments. For the U.S. pension plans, Adient uses a discount rate provided by an independent third party calculated based on an appropriate mix of high quality bonds. For the non-U.S. pension, Adient consistently uses the relevant country specific benchmark indices for determining the various discount rates. Adient's discount rate on U.S. pension plans was 5.87% and 5.51% at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Adient's weighted average discount rate on non-U.S. plans was 5.60% and 4.98% at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIn estimating the expected return on plan assets, Adient considers the historical returns on plan assets, adjusted for forward-looking considerations, inflation assumptions and the impact of the active management of the plans' invested assets. Reflecting the relatively long-term nature of the plans' obligations, approximately 60% of the plans' assets are invested in fixed income securities and 15% in equity securities, with the remainder primarily invested in alternative investments. For fiscal years 2023 and 2022, Adient's expected long-term return on U.S. pension plan assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost was 6.75% and 6.75% respectively. The actual rate of return on U.S. pension plans was above 6.75% in fiscal 2023 and was below 6.75% in fiscal 2022. For fiscal years 2023 and 2022, Adient's weighted average expected long-term return on non-U.S. pension plan assets was 4.53% and 3.20%, respectively. The actual rate of return on non-U.S. pension plans was below 4.53% in fiscal 2023 and was above 3.20% in fiscal 2022.\nFor fiscal 2024, Adient estimates the long-term rate of return will approximate 6.75% and 4.95% for U.S. pension and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. Any differences between actual investment results and the expected long-term asset returns will be reflected in net periodic benefit costs in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. If Adient's actual returns on plan assets are less than Adient's expectations, additional contributions may be required.\nIn fiscal 2023, total Adient contributions to the defined benefit pension plans were $17 million. Adient expects to contribute at least $20 million in cash to its defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2024.\nBased on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources, Adient believes that the assumptions used are reasonable; however, changes in these assumptions could impact Adient's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe following table illustrates estimated increases (decreases) in projected benefit obligation (PBO) and net periodic benefit cost excluding changes in mark-to-market adjustments and settlement charges (NPBC) as of September 30, 2023 and for fiscal 2023 assuming a decrease of 100 basis points in the discount rate and expected return on plan assets.\nPension Benefits\nU.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans\n(in millions) Change in PBO Change in NPBC Change in PBO Change in NPBC\n100 basis point decrease in discount rate $ 1 $ - $ 40 $ (2)\n100 basis point decrease in expected return on plan assets N/A - N/A 3\nRefer to Note 14, \"Retirement Plans,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on Adient's pension plans.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 47\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Adient records a valuation allowance that primarily represents operating and other loss carryforwards for which realization is uncertain. Management judgment is required in determining Adient's provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against Adient's net deferred tax assets.\nAdient reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or combined group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered, along with any other positive or negative evidence. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to Adient's valuation allowances may be necessary.\nAdient is subject to income taxes in Ireland, the U.S. and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of Adient's business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Adient's income tax returns for various fiscal years remain under audit by the respective tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.\nAdient does not generally provide for additional income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. Adient's intent is for such earnings to be reinvested by the subsidiaries or to be repatriated only when it would be tax efficient.\nRefer to Note 16, \"Income Taxes,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for Adient's income tax disclosures.\nRestructuring Costs\nAdient accrues costs in connection with its restructuring actions. These accruals include estimates primarily related to employee headcount, local statutory benefits, and other employee termination costs. Actual costs may vary from these estimates. These accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to restructuring actions are appropriately recognized when identified. Refer to Note 15, Restructuring and Impairment Costs, of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.\nDuring fiscal 2023, Adient committed to a restructuring plan (2023 Plan) of $39 million. Adient also recorded additional charges totaling $1 million related to prior year plans. The restructuring actions relate to cost reduction initiatives and consist primarily of workforce reductions in EMEA. Adient estimated that upon completion of the restructuring actions, the fiscal 2023 restructuring plan would reduce annual operating costs by approximately $30 million, which was primarily the result of lower costs of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses due to reduced employee-related costs, of which approximately 15% would result in net savings. The restructuring actions are expected to be substantially completed by fiscal 2025.\nDuring fiscal 2022, Adient committed to a restructuring plan (2022 Plan) of $25 million that was offset by $10 million of prior year underspend. The restructuring actions relate to cost reduction initiatives and consist primarily of workforce reductions in EMEA and Americas. Adient estimated that upon completion of the restructuring actions, the fiscal 2022 restructuring plan would reduce annual operating costs by approximately $30 million, which was primarily the result of lower costs of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses due to reduced employee-related costs, of which approximately 30% would result in net savings. The restructuring actions were substantially completed by fiscal 2023.\nDuring fiscal 2021, Adient committed to a restructuring plan (2021 Plan) of $27 million that was offset by $16 million of prior year underspend. Of the restructuring costs recorded, $23 million related to the EMEA segment, $3 million related to the Americas segment, and $1 million related to the Asia segment. The restructuring actions related to cost reduction initiatives and consist primarily of workforce reductions and lease contract terminations. Adient estimated that upon completion of the restructuring actions, the fiscal 2021 restructuring plan would reduce annual operating costs by approximately $23 million, which was primarily the result of lower costs of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses due to reduced\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 48\nemployee-related costs, of which approximately 20%-30% would result in net savings. The restructuring actions were substantially completed by fiscal 2023.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 49 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\nAdient regularly reviews its underlying foreign exchange and interest rate exposures, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with applicable derivative hedge positions. Given the effective horizons of Adient's risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there is no assurance the derivative hedge positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in Adient's underlying foreign exchange or interest rate exposures. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect Adient's financial condition and operating results.\nAdient selectively uses derivative instruments to reduce market risk associated with changes in foreign currency. All hedging transactions were authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures, which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative purposes. At the inception of the hedge, Adient assesses the effectiveness of the hedge instrument and designates the hedge instrument as either (1) a hedge of a recognized asset or liability or of a recognized firm commitment (a fair value hedge), (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to an unrecognized asset or liability (a cash flow hedge) or (3) a hedge of a net investment in a non-U.S. operation (a net investment hedge). Adient performs hedge effectiveness testing on an ongoing basis depending on the type of hedging instrument used. All other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, are revalued in the consolidated statements of income.\nFor all foreign currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, Adient tests their effectiveness at the cash flow hedges inception and on an on-going basis. The fair value of the hedged exposures and the fair value of the hedge instruments are revalued, and the ratio of the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge instruments to the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge is calculated. The hedge is deemed as highly effective if the ratio is between 80% and 125%.\nFor all designated net investment hedges, Adient assessed its net investment position in non-U.S. operations and compared it with the outstanding net investment hedge principal on a quarterly basis. All hedges are deemed highly effective if the aggregate outstanding principal of the hedge instrument designated as the net investment hedge in a non-U.S. operation is between 80% and 125% of its net investment position in respective non-U.S. operations.\nFurther details are provided in Part II, Item 8.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 53\nthat (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAnnual Goodwill Impairment Assessment\nAs described in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys goodwill balance, which is comprised of the Americas, EMEA and Asia reporting units (collectively, the reporting units), was $2,094 million as of September 30, 2023. Management reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. Fair value of the reporting units is estimated using an income approach utilizing discounted cash flow analyses. This method requires management to make assumptions about estimates of the revenue and the operating margins, as well as the discount rates.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the annual goodwill impairment assessment is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the reporting units; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating managements significant assumptions related to estimates of the operating margins for the Americas reporting unit, estimates of the operating margins as well as the discount rate for the EMEA reporting unit, and estimates of the revenue for the Asia reporting unit; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to managements goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Companys reporting units. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing managements process for developing the fair value estimate of the reporting units; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow analyses; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow analyses; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to estimates of the operating margins for the Americas reporting unit, estimates of the operating margins as well as the discount rate for the EMEA reporting unit, and estimates of the revenue for the Asia reporting unit. Evaluating managements assumptions related to estimates of the revenue and the operating margins involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting units; (ii) the consistency with relevant industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow analyses and the reasonableness of the discount rate.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nDetroit, Michigan\nNovember 17, 2023\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 1957.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 54\nAdient plc\nConsolidated Statements of Income (Loss)\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 2021\nNet sales $ 15,395 $ 14,121 $ 13,680\nCost of sales 14,362 13,314 12,854\nGross profit 1,033 807 826\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 554 598 537\nLoss on business divestitures -

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nAdient is a global leader in the automotive seating supplier industry. Adient has a leading market position in the Americas, Europe and China, and has longstanding relationships with the largest global original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, in the automotive space. Adient's proprietary technologies extend into virtually every area of automotive seating solutions, including complete seating systems, frames, mechanisms, foam, head restraints, armrests and trim covers. Adient is an independent seat supplier with global scale and the capability to design, develop, engineer, manufacture, and deliver complete seat systems and components in every major automotive producing region in the world.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Adient have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). Adient consolidates its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which it has a controlling interest. Investments in partially-owned affiliates are accounted for by the equity method when Adient's interest exceeds 20% and does not have a controlling interest.\nConsolidated VIEs\nBased upon the criteria set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810, \"Consolidation,\" Adient has determined that it was the primary beneficiary in two variable interest entities (VIEs) for the reporting periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as Adient absorbs significant economics of the entities and has the power to direct the activities that are considered most significant to the entities.\nThe two VIEs manufacture seating products in North America for the automotive industry. Adient funds the entities' short-term liquidity needs through revolving credit facilities and has the power to direct the activities that are considered most significant to the entities through its key customer supply relationships.\nThe carrying amounts and classification of assets (none of which are restricted) and liabilities included in Adient's consolidated statements of financial position for the consolidated VIEs are as follows:\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nCurrent assets $ 265 $ 262\nNoncurrent assets 121 113\nTotal assets $ 386 $ 375\nCurrent liabilities $ 228 $ 233\nNoncurrent liabilities 13 14\nTotal liabilities $ 241 $ 247\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The consolidated financial statements reflect management's estimates as of the reporting date. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term debt and accounts payable approximate their carrying values. See Note 10, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and Note 11, Fair Value Measurements, of the notes to consolidated financial statements for fair value of financial instruments, including derivative instruments and hedging activities.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 61\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAdient considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash is managed by legal entity, with cash pooling agreements in place for all participating entities on a global basis, as applicable.\nReceivables\nReceivables consist of amounts billed and currently due from customers and revenues that have been recognized for accounting purposes but not yet billed to customers. Adient extends credit to customers in the normal course of business and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts resulting from the inability or unwillingness of customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on historical data along with Adients assessment of expected credit losses that reflects current and forecasted industry and economic conditions. This methodology is in accordance with ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. Adient enters into supply chain financing programs in certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions to either sell or discount accounts receivable without recourse to third-party institutions. Sales or discounts of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable on the consolidated statements of financial position and the proceeds are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, $170 million and $269 million have been funded under these programs, respectively.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Finished goods and work-in-process inventories include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs.\nPre-Production Costs Related to Long-Term Supply Arrangements\nAdient's policy for engineering, research and development, and other design and development costs related to products that will be sold under long-term supply arrangements requires such costs to be expensed as incurred or capitalized if reimbursement from the customer is contractually assured. Income related to recovery of these costs is recorded within selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, Adient recorded within the consolidated statements of financial position $274 million and $239 million, respectively, of engineering and research and development costs for which customer reimbursement is contractually assured. The reimbursable costs are recorded in other current assets if reimbursement will occur in less than one year and in other noncurrent assets if reimbursement will occur beyond one year. At September 30, 2023, Adient had $104 million and $170 million of reimbursable costs recorded in current and noncurrent assets, respectively. At September 30, 2022, Adient had $73 million and $166 million of reimbursable costs recorded in current and noncurrent assets, respectively.\nCosts for molds, dies and other tools used to make products that will be sold under long-term supply arrangements are capitalized within property, plant and equipment if Adient has title to the assets or has the non-cancelable right to use the assets during the term of the supply arrangement. Capitalized items, if specifically designed for a supply arrangement, are amortized over the term of the arrangement; otherwise, amounts are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, approximately $53 million and $53 million, respectively, of costs for molds, dies and other tools were capitalized within property, plant and equipment which represented assets to which Adient had title. In addition, at September 30, 2023, Adient recorded within the consolidated statements of financial position in other current and noncurrent assets $151 million and $11 million, respectively, of costs for molds, dies and other tools for which customer reimbursement is contractually assured. At September 30, 2022, Adient recorded within the consolidated statements of financial position in other current and noncurrent assets $74 million and $15 million, respectively, of costs for molds, dies and other tools for which customer reimbursement is contractually assured.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for income tax purposes. The estimated useful lives range from 3 to 40 years for buildings and improvements and from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 62\nLeases\nOperating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement dates. ROU assets also include payments made in advance and exclude lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that such options are to be exercised. Adient uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate of interest it would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term to the lease in a similar economic environment, for discounting lease consideration as most lease agreements do not provide an implicit rate. Refer to Note 8, Leases of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding Adients leases.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill reflects the cost of an acquisition in excess of the fair values assigned to identifiable net assets acquired. Adient reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. Adient performs impairment reviews for its reporting units, which have been determined to be Adient's reportable segments using a fair value method based on management's judgments and assumptions or third party valuations. The fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In estimating the fair value, Adient primarily uses an income approach utilizing discounted cash flow analyses. Adient also uses a market approach utilizing published multiples of earnings of comparable entities with similar operational and economic characteristics to further support the fair value estimates. The inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. The estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including recorded goodwill. An impairment is recorded to the extent the estimated fair value is below the carrying amount of the reporting unit.\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment testing if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nAdient reviews long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, operating lease ROU assets and other intangible assets with definite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. Adient conducts its long-lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with ASC 360-10-15, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. ASC 360-10-15 requires Adient to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable, an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals.\nImpairment of Investments in Partially-Owned Affiliates\nAdient monitors its investments in partially-owned affiliates for indicators of other-than-temporary declines in value on an ongoing basis. If Adient determines that an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred, it recognizes an impairment loss, which is measured as the difference between the recorded book value and the fair value of the investment. Fair value is generally determined using an income approach based on discounted cash flows or negotiated transaction values. Refer to Note 18, Nonconsolidated Partially-Owned Affiliates, of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on Adients partially-owned affiliates.\nRevenue Recognition\nAdient provides production and service parts to its customers under awarded multi-year programs. The duration of a program is generally consistent with the life cycle of a vehicle, however, an awarded program does not reach the level of a performance obligation until Adient receives either a purchase order and/or a materials release from the customer for a specific number of parts at a specified price, at which point an enforceable contract exists. Sales revenue is recognized at the point in time when parts are shipped and control has transferred to the customer, at which point an enforceable right to payment exists. Contracts may provide for annual price reductions over the production life of the awarded program, and prices are adjusted on an ongoing basis to reflect changes in product content/cost and other commercial factors. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that Adient expects to be entitled to in exchange for such products based on purchase orders, annual price\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 63\nreductions and ongoing price adjustments. Refer to Note 2, Revenue Recognition, of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on Adient's revenue recognition.\nCustomers\nEssentially all of Adient's sales are to the automotive industry. Adient's most significant customers, Volkswagen Group and Stellantis N.V., comprised 11% and 10%, respectively, of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2023. Stellantis N.V. comprised 12% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022, and Stellantis N.V. and Volkswagen Group comprised 13% and 11%, respectively, of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2021.\nResearch and Development Costs\nExpenditures for research activities relating to product development and improvement (other than those expenditures that are contractually guaranteed for reimbursement from the customer) are charged against income as incurred and included within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Such expenditures for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $362 million, $322 million and $316 million, respectively. A portion of these costs associated with these activities are reimbursed by customers and, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $250 million, $194 million and $210 million, respectively.\nGovernment Assistance\nAdient periodically receives government incentives in the forms of cash grants which are based on making qualifying capital investments in property, plant and equipment. Such assistance is initially recorded as a reduction to property, plant and equipment. Once in use, the balance is systematically recognized in the statements of income as the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. Adient also periodically receives government assistance for creating new job opportunities and maintaining a certain number of employees. Such employment-related incentives are normally deferred as current or noncurrent liabilities as appropriate. These benefits are recognized in the statements of income as a reduction of expense when Adient has met or is expected to meet all related contractual obligations. The impact of government assistance received by Adient during fiscal 2023 and related balances as of September 30, 2023 were immaterial.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAdient's international operations, in general, use the respective local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of international entities have been translated at period-end exchange rates, and income and expenses have been translated using average exchange rates for the period. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies are adjusted to reflect period-end exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are accumulated as a component of AOCI. The aggregate transaction gains (losses) included in net income for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $4 million, $6 million and $(8) million, respectively.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe fair values of all derivatives are recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position. The change in a derivative's fair value is recorded each period in current earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and if so, the type of hedge transaction. Refer to Note 10, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and Note 11, Fair Value Measurements, of the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure of Adient's derivative instruments and hedging activities.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is initially measured at the fair value of the awards on the grant date and is recognized in the financial statements over the period the employees are required to provide services in exchange for the awards. The fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the number of units granted and the stock price on the grant date. The fair value of performance-based share unit, or PSU, awards is based on the stock price at the grant date and the assessed probability of meeting future performance targets. The fair value of cash settled awards are recalculated at the end of each reporting period and the liability and expense are adjusted based on the new fair value. Refer to Note 12, Stock-Based Compensation, of the notes to consolidated financial statements for Adient's stock based compensation disclosures.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 64\nPension and Postretirement Benefits\nAdient utilizes a mark-to-market approach for recognizing pension and postretirement benefit expenses, including measuring the market related value of plan assets at fair value and recognizing actuarial gains and losses in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at the date of a remeasurement event. Refer to Note 14, Retirement Plans, of the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure of Adient's pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Adient records a valuation allowance that primarily represents operating and other loss carryforwards for which realization is uncertain. Management judgment is required in determining Adient's provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against Adient's net deferred tax assets.\nAdient reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or combined group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered, along with any other positive or negative evidence. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to Adient's valuation allowances may be necessary.\nAdient is subject to income taxes in Ireland, the U.S. and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of Adient's business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Adient's income tax returns for various fiscal years remain under audit by the respective tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.\nAdient does not generally provide for additional income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. Adient's intent is for such earnings to be reinvested by the subsidiaries or to be repatriated only when it would be tax efficient.\nRefer to Note 16, Income Taxes, of the notes to consolidated financial statements for Adient's income tax disclosures.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 65\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 2021\nNumerator:\nNet income (loss) attributable to Adient $ 205 $ (120) $ 1,108\nDenominator:\nShares outstanding 94.5 94.8 94.2\nEffect of dilutive securities 0.9 - 1.5\nDiluted shares 95.4 94.8 95.7\nEarnings per share:\nBasic $ 2.17 $ (1.27) $ 11.76\nDiluted $ 2.15 $ (1.27) $ 11.58\nThe effect of common stock equivalents which would have been anti-dilutive was excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2023 and 2021 and was immaterial. Potentially dilutive securities whose effect would have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2022 which is a result of being in a loss position.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nStandards Adopted During Fiscal 2023\nOn October 1, 2022, Adient adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASU) 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity by reducing the number of accounting models for convertible debt and convertible preferred stock. The adoption of this guidance on October 1, 2022 did not significantly impact Adient's consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2023.\nOn October 1, 2022, Adient adopted ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832) - Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance. The ASU requires annual disclosures of: (i) information about the nature of government assistance transactions and the related accounting policy used to account for the transactions; (ii) the balance sheet and income statement line items affected by the transactions, and the amounts for each financial statement line item; and (iii) significant transaction terms and conditions. The adoption of this guidance on October 1, 2022 resulted in new disclosures but did not significantly impact Adient's consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2023.\nStandards Effective After Fiscal 2023\nAdient has considered the ASU summarized below, effective after fiscal 2023, which is not expected to significantly impact the consolidated financial statements but will result in new disclosures:\nStandard Pending Adoption Description Date Effective\nASU 2022-04, Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations The ASU requires buyers of goods and services to disclose information about supplier finance programs if such arrangements are used to manage their payables. The disclosures should include both qualitative and quantitative information including key terms and the amount of outstanding obligations. October 1, 2023\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 66\n2. Revenue Recognition\nAdient generates revenue through the sale of automotive seating solutions, including complete seating systems and the components of complete seating systems. Adient provides production and service parts to its customers under awarded multi-year programs. The duration of a program is generally consistent with the life cycle of a vehicle, however, the program can be canceled at any time without cause by the customer. Programs awarded to Adient to supply parts to its customers do not contain a firm commitment by the customer for volume or price and do not reach the level of a performance obligation until Adient receives either a purchase order and/or a materials release from the customer for a specific number of parts at a specified price, at which point an enforceable contract exists. Sales revenue is generally recognized at the point in time when parts are shipped and control has transferred to the customer, at which point an enforceable right to payment exists. Contracts may provide for annual price reductions over the production life of the awarded program, and prices are adjusted on an ongoing basis to reflect changes in product content/cost and other commercial factors. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that Adient expects to be entitled to in exchange for such products based on purchase orders, annual price reductions and ongoing price adjustments (some of which are accounted for as variable consideration and subject to being constrained), net of the impact, if any, of consideration paid to the customer. Approximately 1% of net sales recorded in fiscal 2023 were related to product sales transacted in prior fiscal years.\nIn a typical arrangement with the customer, purchase orders are issued for pre-production activities which consist of engineering, design and development, tooling and prototypes for the manufacture and delivery of component parts. Adient has concluded that these activities are not in the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nAdient includes shipping and handling fees billed to customers in revenue, while including costs of shipping and handling in cost of sales. Taxes collected from customers are excluded from revenue and credited directly to obligations to the appropriate government agencies. Payment terms with customers are established based on customary industry and regional practices. Adient has evaluated the terms of its arrangements and determined that they do not contain significant financing components.\nContract assets primarily relate to the right to consideration for work completed, but not billed at the reporting date on contracts with customers. The contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional. Contract liabilities primarily relate to contracts where advance payments or deposits have been received, but performance obligations have not yet been satisfied and revenue has not been recognized. No significant contract assets or liabilities exist at September 30, 2023. As described above, the issuance of a purchase order and/or a materials release by the customer represents the point at which an enforceable contract with the customer exists. Therefore, Adient has elected to apply the practical expedient in ASC 606, paragraph 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about the remaining performance obligations that have an original expected duration of one year or less. Refer to Note 17, Segment Information, of the notes to consolidated financial statements for disaggregated revenue by geographical market.\n3. Acquisitions and Divestitures\n2023 Transactions\nAdient completed the acquisition of Nantong Yanfeng Adient Seating Trim Co., Ltd. (YFAT) from KEIPER Seating Mechanisms Co., Ltd. (KEIPER), in April 2023 for \u00a5150 million ($23 million). Adient made an initial deposit of \u00a575 million ($12 million) in fiscal 2022, which represents 50% of the purchase price (reflected within other current assets as of September 30, 2022). During fiscal 2023, Adient paid the remaining purchase price of \u00a575 million ($11 million). The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method, and the operating results and cash flows of YFAT are included in Adient's consolidated financial statements starting from May 2023. The acquisition is expected to provide additional synergies within the Asia segment. Adient recorded a purchase price allocation for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the April 2023 acquisition date, which included $13 million of goodwill and $5 million of acquired cash. The allocation of the purchase price is based on the valuations performed to determine the fair value of the net assets as of the acquisition date. If the acquisition of YFAT had occurred on October 1, 2021, its impact on Adient's net sales and net income attributable to Adient for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 would have been immaterial. Upon acquisition, YFAT was renamed as Adient (Nantong) Automotive Seating Components Co., Ltd.\nAdient also completed in fiscal 2023 the transfer of all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in two joint ventures in China held directly by Adient, each of which represents 25% of their total issued and outstanding equity interests, to Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems Company Ltd. (Yanfeng) for $3 million. Adient concluded that indicators of other-than-temporary impairment were present related to the investments in these joint ventures during fiscal 2022, and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $3 million.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 67\n2021 Yanfeng Transaction\nOn March 12, 2021, Adient, Yanfeng, Yanfeng Adient Seating Co., Ltd. (YFAS), a joint venture owned, directly or indirectly, by Yanfeng (50.01%) and Adient (49.99%), and KEIPER, a joint venture owned, directly or indirectly, by Yanfeng (50%) and Adient (50%), entered into a Master Agreement (the 2021 Agreement), pursuant to which the parties agreed to, among other things, transactions that resulted in the sale of Adients 49.99% interest in YFAS to Yanfeng, the sale of Adients ownership interests in 3 other related joint ventures (ranging from 10% to 25%) to YFAS/KEIPER, and the purchase of YFASs 50% interest in Chongqing Adient Automotive Components Co., Ltd. (CQADNT) and YFASs 100% interest in Adient (Langfang) Seating Co., Ltd. (LFADNT) (collectively, the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction). The 2021 Yanfeng Transaction closed on September 30, 2021 (Closing Date).\nAs a result of the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction, Adient received net cash proceeds of $1,141 million ($489 million in September 2021 and $652 million in December 2021) for the sale of Adients 49.99% interest in YFAS to Yanfeng, $100 million as the final cash dividend from YFAS, $59 million for the sale of Adients ownership interests in the 3 other related joint ventures, $54 million for granting a license of intellectual property to Yanfeng for use on a non-exclusive and perpetual basis, and a business consulting fee of $13 million. Adient also made a net payment of $211 million to Yanfeng related to the purchase CQADNT and LFADNT (the purchase price of $271 million, less $60 million cash acquired) on the Closing Date.\nIn conjunction with the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction, Adient provided Chongqing Boxun Industrial Co., Ltd. (Boxun), which owned 25% of CQADNT, an option to sell its interest in CQADNT. This option was reflected as $194 million of redeemable noncontrolling interest on Adients statement of financial position as of September 30, 2021. Boxun exercised its option in October 2021, and Adient acquired Boxuns 25% interest effective January 2022. The total payment to Boxun from Adient was approximately $200 million, of which $15 million of historical dividends were paid in December 2021, and $185 million, including $32 million of historical dividends, was paid later in fiscal 2022. With the acquisitions of Boxuns 25% and YFASs 50% interest of CQADNT, Adient owns 100% of CQADNT effective January 2022.\nAs a result of the 2021 Agreement, Adient also received $41 million during fiscal 2022 ($19 million had been receiving in fiscal 2021) representing the remaining balance of proceeds from the sale of its interest in Yanfeng Global Automotive Interior Systems Co. (YFAI), a joint venture previously owned, directly or indirectly, by Yanfeng (70%) and Adient (30%), which was part of the 2020 Yanfeng Transaction (as defined and described in Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021).\nRussia/Ukraine conflict\nFollowing Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Adient determined to withdraw from the Russian market. Adient recorded a charge of $5 million during fiscal 2022 in conjunction with completion of the withdrawal from and sale of its Russian operations for one ruble.\nSJA\nOn March 31, 2021, Adient sold its 50% equity interest in Shenyang Jinbei Adient Automotive Components Co., Ltd. (SJA) to the joint venture partner for $58 million, which resulted in a $33 million one-time gain recognized during fiscal 2021.\nAssets held for sale\nDuring fiscal 2022, Adient committed to sell certain assets in EMEA. As a result, these assets were classified as assets held for sale and were required to be adjusted to the lower of fair value less cost to sell or carrying value. This resulted in an impairment charge of $6 million. The impairment was measured using third party sales pricing to determine fair values of the assets. The inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement.\nDuring fiscal 2021, Adient committed to sell certain assets in France and Turkey. As a result, these assets were classified as assets held for sale (including an allocation of $11 million of goodwill) and were required to be adjusted to the lower of fair value less cost to sell or carrying value. This resulted in Adient recording an impairment charge of $9 million within restructuring and impairment costs on the consolidated statement of income (loss) related to the assets in France. The impairment was measured using third party sales pricing to determine fair values of the assets. The inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement.\" The sale of the assets in France was completed in fiscal 2021 for minimal proceeds while the sale of the assets in Turkey was completed in fiscal 2022 for total proceeds of $46 million, of which $36 million was collected at closing, and $10 million was collected later in fiscal 2022.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 68\n4.

As of September 30, 2022, Adient is the lessor of properties included in gross building and improvements for $12 million and accumulated depreciation of $8 million.\n6. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows:\n(in millions) Americas EMEA Asia Total\nBalance at September 30, 2021 $ 607 $ 354 $ 1,251 $ 2,212\nCurrency translation and other - (59) (96) (155)\nBalance at September 30, 2022 $ 607 $ 295 $ 1,155 $ 2,057\nBusiness acquisitions - - 13 13\nCurrency translation and other 2 22 - 24\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ 609 $ 317 $ 1,168 $ 2,094\nRefer to Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures, of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nAdient performed its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 using a fair value method based on management's judgments and assumptions regarding future cash flows. These calculations contain uncertainties as they require management to make assumptions about market comparables, future cash flows, and the appropriate discount rates\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 69\n(based on weighted average cost of capital ranging from 17.0% to 20.5%) to reflect the risk inherent in the future cash flows and to derive a reasonable enterprise value and related premium. The estimated future cash flows reflect management's latest assumptions of the financial projections based on current and anticipated competitive landscape, including estimates of revenue based on production volumes over the foreseeable future and long-term growth rates, and operating margins based on historical trends and future cost containment activities. The financial projections considered the impact of the various issues causing the volatility in the automotive industry such as wage inflationary pressures and higher interest rates. As a result of the test, there was no goodwill impairment recorded for fiscal year 2023. A change in any of these estimates and assumptions could produce significantly lower fair values of Adients reporting units, which could have a material impact on its results of operations.\nAdient's other intangible assets, primarily from business acquisitions valued based on independent appraisals, consisted of:\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2022\n(in millions) Gross\nCarrying\nAmount Accumulated\nAmortization Net Gross\nCarrying\nAmount Accumulated\nAmortization Net\nIntangible assets\nPatented technology $ 79 $ (32) $ 47 $ 80 $ (25) $ 55\nCustomer relationships 550 (201) 349 560 (163) 397\nTrademarks 17 (17) - 19 (17) 2\nMiscellaneous 24 (12) 12 25 (12) 13\nTotal intangible assets $ 670 $ (262) $ 408 $ 684 $ (217) $ 467\nAmortization of other intangible assets for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $50 million, $52 million and $45 million, respectively. Adient anticipates amortization for fiscal 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028 will be approximately $48 million, $47 million, $45 million, $39 million and $31 million, respectively.\n7. Product Warranty\nAdient offers warranties to its customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement. A typical warranty program requires that Adient replace defective products within a specified time period from the date of sale. Adient records an estimate for future warranty-related costs based on actual historical return rates and other known factors. Based on analysis of return rates and other factors, Adient's warranty provisions are adjusted as necessary. Adient monitors its warranty activity and adjusts its reserve estimates when it is probable that future warranty costs will be different than those estimates. Adient's product warranty liability is recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position in other current liabilities.\nThe changes in Adient's total product warranty liability are as follows:\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nBalance at beginning of period $ 21 $ 23\nAccruals for warranties issued during the period 8 8\nSettlements made (in cash or in kind) during the period (8) (9)\nCurrency translation - (1)\nBalance at end of period $ 21 $ 21\n8. Leases\nAdient's lease portfolio consists of operating leases for real estate including production facilities, warehouses and administrative offices, equipment such as forklifts and computer servers and laptops, and fleet vehicles. Adient has elected not to record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on its consolidated statement of financial position.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 70\nA lease liability and corresponding ROU asset are recognized based on the present value of lease payments. To determine the present value of lease payments, Adient uses its incremental borrowing rate as of lease commencement. The incremental borrowing rate (IBR) is defined as the rate Adient would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Adient primarily derives its IBR from its debt portfolio, adjusted for collateralization, lease term and jurisdictional factors.\nThe components of lease costs for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nOperating lease cost $ 108 $ 117 $ 125\nShort-term lease cost 29 20 20\nTotal lease cost $ 137 $ 137 $ 145\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities included in the consolidated statement of financial position were as follows:\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nOperating leases:\nOperating lease right-of-use assets Other noncurrent assets $ 241 $ 266\nOperating lease liabilities - current Other current liabilities $ 77 $ 81\nOperating lease liabilities - noncurrent Other noncurrent liabilities 163 186\n$ 240 $ 267\nWeighted average remaining lease term:\nOperating leases 5 years 6 years\nWeighted average discount rate:\nOperating leases 6.1 % 5.6 %\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities and minimum payments for operating leases having initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of September 30, 2023 were as follows:\nFiscal years (in millions) Operating Leases\n2024 $ 88\n2025 63\n2026 41\n2027 29\n2028 20\nThereafter 45\nTotal lease payments 286\nLess: imputed interest (46)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 240\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 71\nYear Ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations:\nOperating leases (non-cash activity) $ 35 $ 52 $ 109\nOperating cash flows:\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 108 $ 116 $ 126\nAdients finance leases were not significant to the consolidated financial statements during fiscal 2023 and 2022. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Financing Arrangements, of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n9. Debt and Financing Arrangements\nLong-term and short-term debt consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nLong-term debt:\n8.25% Notes due 2031\n$ 500 $ -\n7.00% Secured Notes due 2028\n500 -\nTerm Loan B due in 2028 635 988\n4.875% Notes due in 2026\n795 795\n3.50% Notes due in 2024\n130 809\nOther bank borrowings and finance lease obligations 4 1\nLess: debt issuance costs (31) (18)\nGross long-term debt 2,533 2,575\nLess: current portion 132 11\nNet long-term debt $ 2,401 $ 2,564\nShort-term debt:\nOther bank borrowings (1)\n2 3\nTotal short-term debt $ 2 $ 3\n(1) The weighted average interest rates on short-term debts, based on levels of debt maintained in various jurisdictions, were 10.1% and 6.0% at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAdient US LLC (Adient US), a wholly owned subsidiary of Adient, together with certain of Adient's other subsidiaries, maintains an asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Facility), which provides for a revolving line of credit up to $1,250 million, including a North American subfacility of up to $950 million and a European subfacility of up to $300 million, subject to borrowing base capacity and certain other restrictions, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The ABL Credit Facility, as amended in November 2022, is set to mature on November 2, 2027, subject to certain springing maturity provisions. Adient paid $7 million in debt issuance costs for the amended ABL Credit Facility and will pay a commitment fee of 0.25% to 0.375% on the unused portion of the commitments under the asset-based revolving credit facility based on average global availability. Letters of credit are limited to the lesser of (x) $150 million and (y) the aggregate unused amount of commitments under the ABL Credit Facility then in effect. Subject to certain conditions, the ABL Credit Facility may be expanded by up to $250 million in additional commitments. Loans under the ABL Credit Facility may be denominated, at the option of Adient, in U.S. dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling or Swedish Kroner. It also provides flexibility for future amendments to the ABL Facility to incorporate certain sustainability-based pricing provisions. The ABL Credit Agreement is secured on a first-priority lien on all accounts receivable, inventory and bank accounts (and funds on deposit therein) and a second-priority lien on all of the tangible and intangible assets of certain Adient subsidiaries. Interest is payable on the ABL\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 72\nCredit Facility at a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to Term SOFR, in the case of amounts outstanding in dollars, EURIBOR, in the case of amounts outstanding in euros, STIBOR, in the case of amounts outstanding in Swedish krona and SONIA, in the case of amounts outstanding in pounds sterling, in each case, plus an applicable margin of 1.50% to 2.00%. As of September 30, 2023, Adient had not drawn down on the ABL Credit Facility and had availability under this facility of approximately $900 million (net of $12 million of letters of credit).\nIn addition, Adient US and Adient Global Holdings S.\u00e0 r.l., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adient, maintain a senior secured term loan facility (the Term Loan B Agreement) that had an outstanding balance of $988 million as of September 30, 2022. During fiscal 2023, Adient prepaid $350 million of the Term Loan B Agreement principal, and wrote off $2 million of previously deferred financing costs to net financing charges. As of September 30, 2023, the remaining balance of this debt was $635 million, maintained fully at Adient Global Holdings S.\u00e0 r.l., which is due at final maturity on April 8, 2028. Interest on the Term Loan B Agreement accrues at the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin equal to 3.25%. The Term Loan B Agreement also permits Adient to incur incremental term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of $750 million and an unlimited amount subject to a pro forma first lien secured net leverage ratio of not greater than 1.75 to 1.00 and certain other conditions. In April 2023, the Term Loan B Agreement was amended to replace the LIBOR base rate with Term SOFR.\nThe ABL Credit Facility and Term Loan B Agreement contain covenants that are usual and customary for facilities and debt instruments of this type and that, among other things, restrict the ability of Adient and its restricted subsidiaries to: create certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee certain indebtedness; pay dividends or make other distributions on, or repurchase or redeem, Adients capital stock or certain other debt; make other restricted payments; and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of Adients and its restricted subsidiaries assets, to another person. These covenants are subject to a number of other limitations and exceptions set forth in the agreements. The agreements also provide for customary events of default, including, but not limited to, cross-default clauses with other debt arrangements, failure to pay principal and interest, failure to comply with covenants, agreements or conditions, and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency involving Adient and its significant subsidiaries.\nDuring fiscal 2023, Adient Global Holdings Ltd. (AGH), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adient, issued (i) $500 million (net proceeds of $494 million) in aggregate principal amount of 7% senior secured notes due 2028 and (ii) $500 million (net proceeds of $494 million) in aggregate principal amount of 8.250% senior unsecured notes due 2031. Interest on both of these notes will be paid on April 15 and October 15 each year, beginning on October 15, 2023. These notes contain covenants that are usual and customary. The total net proceeds of $988 million along with cash on hand were used primarily to redeem $350 million of the senior secured term loan facility under the Term Loan B Agreement as described above, and repurchase \u20ac700 million ($743 million) of the 3.50% unsecured notes due 2024 as described below. Adient paid $16 million in debt issuance costs for these new debt issuances.\nAGH previously maintained $900 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% USD-denominated unsecured notes due 2026. Adient redeemed $103 million and $2 million during fiscal 2020 and 2021, respectively, resulting in a remaining balance of $795 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nAGH also previously maintained \u20ac1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.50% unsecured notes due in August 2024. During fiscal 2022, Adient repurchased \u20ac177 million ($198 million) of the 3.50% unsecured notes due 2024 at a premium of \u20ac3 million ($4 million) plus \u20ac3 million ($3 million) of accrued and unpaid interest, and expensed \u20ac1 million ($1 million) of previously deferred financing costs to net financing charges, resulting in a remaining balance of \u20ac823 million ($809 million) as of September 30, 2022. During fiscal 2023, Adient repurchased an additional \u20ac700 million ($743 million) of the 3.50% unsecured notes due 2024 at a premium of \u20ac7 million ($7 million) plus \u20ac3 million ($3 million) of accrued and unpaid interest, and expensed \u20ac2 million ($2 million) of previously deferred financing costs to net financing charges. As of September 30, 2023, the remaining balance of this debt was \u20ac123 million ($130 million) and is classified as current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated statement of financial position.\nAdient Germany Ltd. & Co. KG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Adient, previously maintained \u20ac135 million ($156 million) in an unsecured term loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB) due in 2022. The loan bore interest at the 6-month EURIBOR rate plus 158 basis points. During fiscal 2021, Adient repaid $36 million of the EIB loan, triggered in part by the redemption of debt and the sale of the fabrics business in the prior year. Adient fully repaid the remaining balance of the EIB loan in May 2022 upon its maturity.\nIn April 2020, Adient US issued $600 million (net proceeds of $591 million) aggregate principal amount of 9.00% Senior First Lien Notes due 2025.

Total interest paid on both short and long-term debt for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $132 million, $192 million and $229 million, respectively.\nAdient enters into supply chain financing programs in certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions to either sell or discount accounts receivable without recourse to third-party institutions. Sales or discounts of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable on the consolidated statements of financial position and the proceeds are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. As of September 30, 2023, $170 million was funded under these programs compared to $269 million as of September 30, 2022.\n10. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nAdient selectively uses derivative instruments to reduce Adient's market risk associated with changes in foreign currency. Under Adient's policy, the use of derivatives is restricted to those intended for hedging purposes; the use of any derivative instrument for speculative purposes is strictly prohibited. A description of each type of derivative utilized to manage Adient's risk is included in the following paragraphs. In addition, refer to Note 11, Fair Value Measurements, of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to the fair value measurements and valuation methods utilized by Adient for each derivative type.\nAdient has global operations and participates in the foreign exchange markets to minimize its risk of loss from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Adient primarily uses foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign exchange rate exposures. Adient hedges 70% to 90% of the nominal amount of each of its known foreign exchange transactional exposures. Gains and losses on derivative contracts offset gains and losses on underlying foreign currency exposures. These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges under ASC 815, \"Derivatives and Hedging,\" and the hedge gains or losses due to changes in fair value are initially recorded as a component of AOCI and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transactions occur and affect earnings. All contracts were highly effective in hedging the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the \u20ac123 million ($130 million) aggregate principal amount of 3.50% euro-denominated unsecured notes due August 2024 was designated as a net investment hedge to selectively hedge portions of Adient's net investment in\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 74\nEurope. The currency effects of Adient's euro-denominated notes are reflected in the AOCI account within shareholders' equity attributable to Adient where they offset gains and losses recorded on Adient's net investment in Europe. In October 2023, Adient de-designated these notes as a net investment hedge concurrent with entering into a foreign exchange forward contract designated as a fair value hedge of the remaining principal balance on the 3.50% notes. The impact of foreign currency changes on the notes and the contract will be recorded in net financing charges until payment of the notes and maturity of the foreign exchange forward contract in August 2024.\nAdient entered into a \u00a5240 million ($35 million) foreign exchange forward contract during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to selectively hedge portions of its net investment in China. The currency effects of the forward contract were reflected in the AOCI account within shareholders equity attributable to Adient, where they offset gains and losses recorded on Adients net investment in China. During fiscal 2023, the foreign exchange forward contract matured, the impact of which was not material.\nAdient entered into a \u00a5150 million ($23 million) foreign exchange forward contract during fiscal 2022 to selectively hedge portions of its net investment in China. The currency effects of the forward contract are reflected in the AOCI account within shareholders equity attributable to Adient, where they offset gains and losses recorded on Adients net investment in China. The forward contract matured in early fiscal 2023, the impact of which was not material.\nThe following table presents the location and fair values of derivative instruments and other amounts used in hedging activities included in Adient's consolidated statements of financial position:\nDerivatives and Hedging\nActivities Designated as\nHedging Instruments\nunder ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging\nActivities Not Designated as\nHedging Instruments\nunder ASC 815\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022\nOther current assets\nForeign currency exchange derivatives $ 30 $ 17 $ 4 $ 3\nTotal assets $ 30 $ 17 $ 4 $ 3\nOther current liabilities\nForeign currency exchange derivatives $ 8 $ 20 $ - $ -\nOther noncurrent liabilities\nForeign currency exchange derivatives 6 2 - 1\nLong-term debt\nForeign currency denominated debt 130 809 - -\nTotal liabilities $ 144 $ 831 $ - $ 1\nAdient enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Associations master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the net settlement of amounts owed under the derivative contracts. The master netting agreements generally provide for net settlement of all outstanding contracts with a counterparty in the case of an event of default or a termination event. Adient has not elected to offset the fair value positions of the derivative contracts recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position. Collateral is generally not required of Adient or the counterparties under the master netting agreements. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, no cash collateral was received or pledged under the master netting agreements.\nThe gross and net amounts of derivative instruments and other amounts used in hedging activities are as follows:\nAssets Liabilities\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022\nGross amount recognized $ 34 $ 20 $ 144 $ 832\nGross amount eligible for offsetting (12) (19) (12) (19)\nNet amount $ 22 $ 1 $ 132 $ 813\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 75\nThe following table presents the effective portion of pretax gains (losses) recorded in other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges:\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nForeign currency exchange derivatives $ 89 $ 8 $ 29\nThe following table presents the location and amount of the effective portion of pretax gains (losses) on cash flow hedges reclassified from AOCI into Adient's consolidated statements of income:\n(in millions) Year Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nForeign currency exchange derivatives Cost of sales $ 66 $ 6 $ 2\nDuring the next twelve months, $23 million of pretax gains on cash flow hedges are expected to be reclassified from AOCI into Adient's consolidated statements of income.\nThe following table presents the location and amount of pretax gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments recognized in Adient's consolidated statements of income (loss):\n(in millions) Year Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nForeign currency exchange derivatives Cost of sales $ 8 $ - $ (4)\nForeign currency exchange derivatives Net financing charges (10) (33) (30)\nTotal $ (2) $ (33) $ (34)\nThe effective portion of pretax gains (losses) recorded in currency translation adjustment (CTA) within other comprehensive income (loss) related to net investment hedges was $(67) million, $151 million and $17 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, no significant gains or losses were reclassified from CTA into income for Adient's outstanding net investment hedges. For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, no gains or losses were recognized in income for the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges.\n11. Fair Value Measurements\nASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement,\" defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes information used in developing assumptions when pricing an asset or liability as follows:\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\nLevel 2: Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs where there is little or no market data, which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nASC 820 requires the use of observable market data, when available, in making fair value measurements. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 76\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nThe following tables present Adient's fair value hierarchy for those assets and liabilities measured at fair value. Refer to Note 14, Retirement Plans, of the notes to consolidated financial statements for fair value tables of pension assets.\nFair Value Measurements Using:\n(in millions) Total as of\nSeptember 30,\n2023 Quoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets\n(Level 1) Significant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\n(Level 2) Significant\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3)\nOther current assets\nForeign currency exchange derivatives $ 34 $ - $ 34 $ -\nTotal assets $ 34 $ - $ 34 $ -\nOther current liabilities\nForeign currency exchange derivatives $ 8 $ - $ 8 $ -\nOther noncurrent liabilities\nForeign currency exchange derivatives 6 - 6 -\nTotal liabilities $ 14 $ - $ 14 $ -\nFair Value Measurements Using:\n(in millions) Total as of\nSeptember 30,\n2022 Quoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets\n(Level 1) Significant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\n(Level 2) Significant\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3)\nOther current assets\nForeign currency exchange derivatives $ 20 $ - $ 20 $ -\nTotal assets $ 20 $ - $ 20 $ -\nOther current liabilities\nForeign currency exchange derivatives $ 20 $ - $ 20 $ -\nOther noncurrent liabilities\nForeign currency exchange derivatives 3 - 3 -\nTotal liabilities $ 23 $ - $ 23 $ -\nValuation Methods\nForeign currency exchange derivatives Adient selectively hedges anticipated transactions and net investments that are subject to foreign exchange rate risk primarily using foreign currency exchange hedge contracts. The foreign currency exchange derivatives are valued under a market approach using publicized spot and forward prices. Changes in fair value on foreign exchange derivatives accounted for as hedging instruments under ASC 815 are initially recorded as a component of AOCI and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transactions occur and affect earnings. These contracts were highly effective in hedging the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The changes in fair value of foreign currency exchange derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815 are recorded in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term debt and accounts payable approximate their carrying values. The fair value of long-term debt, which was $2.5 billion and $2.4 billion at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, was determined primarily using market quotes classified as Level 1 inputs within the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 77\n12. Stock-Based Compensation\nAdient provides certain key employees equity awards in the form of restricted stock units (RSU) and performance share units (PSUs) under the Adient plc 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan and the Adient plc 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (collectively, the Plan). Adient also provides directors with share awards under the Adient plc 2016 Director Share Plan and the Adient plc 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan. These 2016 plans were adopted in conjunction with the separation. The 2021 plan was adopted in March 2021.\nTotal stock-based compensation cost included in the consolidated statements of income was $34 million, $29 million and $36 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. No material income tax benefits were recognized in the consolidated statements of income for the share-based compensation arrangements in any of these years due to tax valuation allowances in those years.\nThe following tables present activity related to the granting of awards during the year ended September 30, 2023 along with the composition of outstanding and exercisable awards at September 30, 2023.\nRestricted Stock\nThe Plan provides for the award of restricted stock or restricted stock units to certain employees. These awards are typically share settled except for certain non-U.S. employees which are settled in cash. Cash settled awards are recorded in Adient's consolidated statements of financial position as a liability and adjusted each reporting period for changes in share value until the settlement of the award. Restricted stock awards typically vest over a three year period following the grant date. The Plan allows for different vesting terms on specific grants with approval by Adient's board of directors.\nA summary of the status of nonvested restricted stock awards at September 30, 2023, and changes for the fiscal year then ended, is presented below:\nWeighted\nAverage\nPrice Restricted Shares/Units\nNonvested, September 30, 2022\n$ 32.94 872,417\nGranted 38.38 678,147\nVested 29.42 (523,325)\nForfeited 38.32 (65,150)\nNonvested, September 30, 2023\n$ 38.32 962,089\nAt September 30, 2023, Adient had approximately $22 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock arrangements granted. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.\nPerformance Share Awards\nThe Plan permits the grant of PSU awards. The number of PSUs granted is equal to the PSU award value divided by the closing price of a Adient ordinary share at the grant date. The PSUs are generally contingent on the achievement of predetermined performance goals over a three-year performance period as well as on the award holder's continuous employment until the vesting date. Each PSU that is earned will be settled with an ordinary share of Adient following the completion of the performance period except for certain non-U.S. employees which are settled in cash. Cash settled awards are recorded in Adient's consolidated statements of financial position as a liability and adjusted each reporting period for changes in share value until the settlement of the award.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 78\nA summary of the status of Adient's nonvested PSUs at September 30, 2023, and changes for the fiscal year then ended is presented below:\nWeighted\nAverage\nPrice Performance Shares/Units\nNonvested, September 30, 2022\n$ 29.51 1,068,714\nGranted 38.50 342,889\nVested 20.69 (442,622)\nForfeited 35.57 (110,398)\nNonvested, September 30, 2023\n$ 36.87 858,583\nAt September 30, 2023, Adient had approximately $19 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested performance share units granted. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years.\nStock Options\nNo new stock options have been granted under the Plan. Stock option awards typically vest between two and three years after the grant date and expire ten years from the grant date. The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model.\nA summary of stock option activity at September 30, 2023, and changes for the year then ended, is presented below:\nWeighted\nAverage\nOption Price Shares\nSubject to\nOption Weighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nLife (years) Aggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\n(in millions)\nOutstanding and exercisable, September 30, 2022\n$ 38.32 49,939\nExercised 25.79 (20,638)\nForfeited or expired 27.54 (2,444)\nOutstanding and exercisable, September 30, 2023\n48.93 26,857 1.3 $ -\nThere were no stock options granted in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised by Adient employees during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $1 million, $1 million and $7 million, respectively.\nStock Appreciation Rights\nNo new SARs have been granted under the Plan. SARs vest under the same terms and conditions as stock option awards; however, they are settled in cash for the difference between the market price on the date of exercise and the exercise price. As a result, SARs are recorded in Adient's consolidated statements of financial position as a liability until the date of exercise.\nThe fair value of each SAR award is estimated using a similar method described for stock options. The fair value of each SAR award is recalculated at the end of each reporting period and the liability and expense are adjusted based on the new fair value.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 79\nA summary of SAR activity at September 30, 2023, and changes for the year then ended, is presented below:\nWeighted\nAverage\nSAR Price Shares\nSubject to\nSAR Weighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nLife (years) Aggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\n(in millions)\nOutstanding, September 30, 2022\n$ 43.87 42,454\nExercised 45.78 (34,269)\nForfeited or expired 35.84 (8,185)\nOutstanding, September 30, 2023\n- - $ -\nIn conjunction with the exercise of SARs, Adient made payments of $1 million, $2 million and $2 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n13. Equity and Noncontrolling Interests\nThe following table presents changes in AOCI attributable to Adient:\nYear Ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nForeign currency translation adjustments\nBalance at beginning of period $ (836) $ (617) $ (634)\nAggregate adjustment for the period, net of tax (18) (219) 17\nBalance at end of period (1)\n(854) (836) (617)\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives\nBalance at beginning of period (8) (8) (28)\nCurrent period changes in fair value, net of tax 79 6 22\nReclassification to income, net of tax (58) (6) (2)\nBalance at end of period 13 (8) (8)\nPension plans\nBalance at beginning of period (1) (2) (3)\nNet reclassifications to AOCI - 1 1\nBalance at end of period (1) (1) (2)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss), end of period $ (842) $ (845) $ (627)\n(1) Foreign currency translation adjustments as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 include derivative net investment hedge gains of $76 million and $143 million, respectively. During the next twelve months, no significant gains or losses are expected to be reclassified from AOCI into Adient's consolidated statements of income.\nAdient consolidates certain subsidiaries in which the noncontrolling interest party has within their control the right to require Adient to redeem all or a portion of its interest in the subsidiary. These redeemable noncontrolling interests are reported at their estimated redemption value. Any adjustment to the redemption value impacts retained earnings but does not impact net income. Redeemable noncontrolling interests which are redeemable only upon future events, the occurrence of which is not currently probable, are recorded at carrying value. The following table presents changes in the redeemable noncontrolling interests:\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 80\nYear Ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nBeginning balance $ 45 $ 240 $ 43\nNet income 27 35 25\nDividends (18) (66) (14)\nBusiness acquisition - - 194\nChange in noncontrolling interest share - (153) -\nForeign currency translation adjustments 3 (11) (8)\nEnding balance $ 57 $ 45 $ 240\nRefer to Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the change in redeemable noncontrolling interests during fiscal 2022 and 2021.\nRepurchases of Equity Securities\nIn November 2022, Adients board of directors authorized the repurchase of Adients ordinary shares up to an aggregate purchase price of $600 million with no expiration date. Under the share repurchase authorization, Adients ordinary shares may be purchased either through discretionary purchases on the open market, by block trades or privately negotiated transactions. The number of ordinary shares repurchased, if any, and the timing of repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including share price, trading volume and general market conditions, as well as on working capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors. During fiscal 2023, Adient repurchased and immediately retired 1,756,777 shares of its ordinary shares at an average purchase price per share of $37.00. The aggregate amount of cash paid to repurchase the shares was $65 million. As of September 30, 2023, the remaining aggregate amount of authorized repurchases was $535 million.\n14. Retirement Plans\nPension Benefits\nAdient maintains non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering primarily non-U.S. employees and a limited number of U.S. employees. The benefits provided are primarily based on years of service and average compensation or a monthly retirement benefit amount. Funding for non-U.S. plans observes the local legal and regulatory limits. Funding for U.S. pension plans equals or exceeds the minimum requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\nFor pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations (ABO) that exceed plan assets, the projected benefit obligation (PBO), ABO and fair value of plan assets of those plans were $155 million, $137 million and $48 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2023, and $129 million, $112 million and $37 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2022.\nFor pension plans with a PBO that exceed plan assets, the PBO, ABO and fair value of plan assets of those plans were $155 million, $137 million and $48 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2023 and $129 million, $112 million and $37 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2022.\nIn fiscal 2023, Adient paid contributions to the defined benefit pension plans of $17 million. Contributions of at least $20 million in cash to its defined benefit pension plans are expected in fiscal 2024. Projected benefit payments from the plans as of September 30, 2023 are estimated as follows (in millions):\n$ 32\n2025 21\n2026 24\n2027 24\n2028 24\n2029-2032 135\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 81\nSavings and Investment Plans\nAdient sponsors various defined contribution savings plans that allow employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax and/or after-tax income in accordance with plan specified guidelines. Under specified conditions, Adient will contribute to certain savings plans based on the employees' eligible pay and/or will match a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits. Matching contributions expense in connection with these plans amounted to $46 million, $23 million and $44 million for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPlan Assets\nAdient's investment policies employ an approach whereby a mix of equities, fixed income and alternative investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. The investment portfolio primarily contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments. Equity investments are diversified across domestic and non-domestic stocks, as well as growth, value and small to large capitalizations. Fixed income investments include corporate and government issues, with short-, mid- and long-term maturities, with a focus on investment grade when purchased and a target duration close to that of the plan liability. Investment and market risks are measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through regular investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic asset/liability studies. The majority of the real estate component of the portfolio is invested in a diversified portfolio of high-quality, operating properties with cash yields greater than the targeted appreciation. Investments in other alternative asset classes, including hedge funds and commodities, diversify the expected investment returns relative to the equity and fixed income investments. As a result of Adient's diversification strategies, there are no significant concentrations of risk within the portfolio of investments.\nAdient's actual asset allocations are in line with target allocations. Adient rebalances asset allocations as appropriate, in order to stay within a range of allocation for each asset category.\nThe expected return on plan assets is based on Adient's expectation of the long-term average rate of return of the capital markets in which the plans invest. The average market returns are adjusted, where appropriate, for active asset management returns. The expected return reflects the investment policy target asset mix and considers the historical returns earned for each asset category. Adient's plan assets by asset category, are as follows:\nFair Value Measurements Using:\n(in millions) Total as of\nSeptember 30,\n2023 Quoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets\n(Level 1) Significant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\n(Level 2) Significant\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3) Net Asset Value (NAV)\nPension\nCash $ 6 $ 6 $ - $ - $ -\nEquity Securities\nDomestic 1 1 - - -\nInternational - Developed 17 17 - - -\nFixed Income Securities\nGovernment 128 30 75 - 23\nCorporate/Other 59 24 25 - 10\nHedge Fund 34 - 34 - -\nReal Estate 18 - - 4 14\nTotal $ 263 $ 78 $ 134 $ 4 $ 47\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 82\nFair Value Measurements Using:\n(in millions) Total as of\nSeptember 30,\n2022 Quoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets\n(Level 1) Significant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\n(Level 2) Significant\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3) Net Asset Value (NAV)\nPension\nCash $ 2 $ 2 $ - $ - $ -\nEquity Securities\nDomestic 1 1 - - -\nInternational - Developed 18 14 - - 4\nInternational - Emerging 1 - - - 1\nFixed Income Securities\nGovernment 125 33 67 - 25\nCorporate/Other 76 22 43 - 11\nHedge Fund 38 - 38 - -\nReal Estate 22 - - 7 15\nTotal $ 283 $ 72 $ 148 $ 7 $ 56\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value.\nCash: The fair value of cash is valued at cost.\nEquity Securities: The fair value of equity securities is determined by direct quoted market prices. The underlying holdings are direct quoted market prices on regulated financial exchanges.\nFixed Income Securities: The fair value of fixed income securities is determined by direct or indirect quoted market prices. If indirect quoted market prices are utilized, the value of assets held in separate accounts is not published, but the investment managers report daily the underlying holdings. The underlying holdings are direct quoted market prices on regulated financial exchanges.\nHedge Funds: The fair value of hedge funds is determined by the custodian. The custodian obtains valuations from underlying managers based on market quotes for the most liquid assets and alternative methods for assets that do not have sufficient trading activity to derive prices. Adient and custodian review the methods used by the underlying managers to value the assets. Adient believes this is an appropriate methodology to obtain the fair value of these assets.\nReal Estate: The fair value of certain investments in real estate is deemed Level 3 since these investments do not have a readily determinable fair value and requires the fund managers independently to arrive at fair value by calculating NAV per share. In order to calculate NAV per share, the fund managers value the real estate investments using any one, or a combination of, the following methods: independent third party appraisals, discounted cash flow analysis of net cash flows projected to be generated by the investment and recent sales of comparable investments. Assumptions used to revalue the properties are updated every quarter. Adient believes this is an appropriate methodology to obtain the fair value of these assets.\nInvestments at NAV: For mutual or collective funds where a NAV is not publicly quoted, the NAV per share is used as a practical expedient and is based on the quoted market prices of the underlying net assets of the fund as reported daily by the fund managers. Funds valued based on NAV per share as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while Adient believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 83\nThe following sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of pension assets measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):\n(in millions) Real Estate\nPension\nAsset value as of September 30, 2021 $ 7\nRedemptions -\nUnrealized gain -\nAsset value as of September 30, 2022 $ 7\nRedemptions (2)\nUnrealized (loss) (1)\nAsset value as of September 30, 2023 $ 4\nFunded Status\nThe table that follows contains the ABO and reconciliations of the changes in the PBO, the changes in plan assets and the funded status:\nPension Benefits\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nAccumulated Benefit Obligation $ 331 $ 322\nChange in Projected Benefit Obligation:\nProjected benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 340 $ 574\nService cost 5 7\nInterest cost 18 11\nActuarial (gain) loss (15) (169)\nBenefits paid (20) (20)\nCurtailments, settlements and other (6) -\nCurrency translation adjustment 27 (63)\nProjected benefit obligation at end of year $ 349 $ 340\nChange in Plan Assets:\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 283 $ 493\nActual return on plan assets (23) (149)\nEmployer contributions, net 17 16\nBenefits paid (20) (20)\nCurtailments, settlements and other (14) (1)\nCurrency translation adjustment 20 (56)\nFair value of plan assets at end of year $ 263 $ 283\nFunded status $ (86) $ (57)\nAmounts recognized in the statement of financial position consist of:\nPension plan assets (other noncurrent assets) $ 22 $ 35\nPension benefits ($16 million in accrued compensation and benefits)\n(108) (92)\nNet amount recognized $ (86) $ (57)\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 84\nPension Benefits\nU.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nWeighted Average Assumptions (1):\nDiscount rate (2)\n5.87 % 5.51 % 5.60 % 4.98 %\nRate of compensation increase N/A N/A 4.53 % 4.43 %\n(1) Plan assets and obligations are determined based on a September 30 measurement date.\n(2) Adient considers the expected benefit payments on a plan-by-plan basis when setting assumed discount rates. As a result, Adient uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the plan jurisdiction, the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments. For the U.S. pension plan, Adient uses a discount rate provided by an independent third party calculated based on an appropriate mix of high quality bonds. For the non-U.S. pension plans, Adient consistently uses the relevant country specific benchmark indices for determining the various discount rates.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nThe amounts in AOCI on the consolidated statements of financial position, exclusive of tax impacts, that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost at September 30, 2023 and 2022 were $2 million and $2 million, respectively, related to pension benefits.\nThe amounts in AOCI expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year for pension and postretirement benefits are not significant.\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost\nThe tables that follow contain the components and key assumptions of net periodic benefit cost related to Adients pension plans:\nPension Benefits\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nComponents of Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Credit):\nService cost $ 5 $ 7 $ 8\nInterest cost 18 10 9\nExpected return on plan assets (12) (14) (18)\nNet actuarial (gain) loss 19 (7) (15)\nSettlement (gain) loss 8 1 -\nNet periodic benefit cost (credit)\n$ 38 $ (3) $ (16)\nPension Benefits\nU.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans\n2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021\nExpense Assumptions:\nDiscount rate 5.51 % 3.06 % 2.91 % 4.98 % 2.14 % 1.70 %\nExpected return on plan assets 6.75 % 6.75 % 5.75 % 4.53 % 3.20 % 3.68 %\nRate of compensation increase N/A N/A NA 4.43 % 4.05 % 4.15 %\n15. Restructuring and Impairment Costs\nTo better align its resources with its overall strategies and reduce the cost structure of its global operations to address the softness in certain underlying markets, Adient commits to restructuring plans as necessary.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 85\nDuring fiscal 2023, Adient committed to a restructuring plan of $39 million. Adient also recorded additional charges totaling $1 million related to prior year plans. The restructuring actions relate to cost reduction initiatives and consist primarily of workforce reductions in EMEA. The restructuring actions are expected to be substantially completed by fiscal 2025. Restructuring costs are included in restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income (loss). The following tables summarize the changes in Adient's restructuring reserve.\n(in millions) Employee Severance and Termination Benefits Currency\nTranslation and Other Total\nBalance at September 30, 2020 $ 233 $ 4 $ 237\n2021 Plan charges 27 - 27\nUtilized - cash (136) - (136)\nNoncash adjustment - (under) overspend and other (12) (1) (13)\nBalance at September 30, 2021 $ 112 $ 3 $ 115\n2022 Plan charges 25 - 25\nUtilized - cash (57) - (57)\nNoncash adjustment - (under) overspend and other (11) (12) (23)\nBalance at September 30, 2022 $ 69 $ (9) $ 60\n2023 Plan charges 39 - 39\nUtilized - cash (53) - (53)\nNoncash adjustment - (under) overspend and other 1 4 5\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ 56 $ (5) $ 51\nAdient's restructuring plans have included workforce reductions of approximately 14,000. Restructuring charges associated with employee severance and termination benefits are paid over the severance period granted to each employee or on a lump sum basis in accordance with individual severance agreements. As of September 30, 2023, approximately 12,000 of the employees have been separated from Adient pursuant to the restructuring plans. In addition, the restructuring plans included twenty-eight plant closures. As of September 30, 2023, twenty-three of the twenty-eight plants have been closed.\nAdient's management closely monitors its overall cost structure and continually analyzes each of its businesses for opportunities to consolidate current operations, improve operating efficiencies and locate facilities in low cost countries in close proximity to customers. This ongoing analysis includes a review of its manufacturing, engineering, purchasing and administrative functions, as well as the overall global footprint for all its businesses. Because of the importance of new vehicle sales by major automotive manufacturers to operations, Adient is affected by the general business conditions in the automotive industry. Future adverse developments in the automotive industry could impact Adient's liquidity position, lead to impairment charges and/or require additional restructuring of its operations.\n16.

No items included in the other category are individually, or when appropriately aggregated, significant.\nThe income tax expense was higher than the Irish statutory rate of 12.5% for fiscal 2022 primarily due to the inability to recognize a tax benefit for losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances, the establishment of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, and the repatriation of foreign earnings, partially offset by tax benefits related to the release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions. No items included in the other category are individually, or when appropriately aggregated, significant.\nThe income tax expense was higher than the Irish statutory rate of 12.5% for fiscal 2021 primarily due to the inability to recognize a tax benefit for losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances, the establishment of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, and the repatriation of foreign earnings, partially offset by tax benefits from audit settlements, the write-off of deferred tax liabilities related to withholding taxes, and withholding taxes on the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction at a rate lower than the Irish statutory rate of 12.5%. No items included in the other category are individually, or when appropriately aggregated, significant.\nThe foreign tax rate differential expense for fiscal 2023 is primarily driven by income earned in jurisdictions where the statutory rate is greater than 12.5%, partially offset by jurisdictions with losses where the statutory rate is greater than 12.5% and by the pretax book income of nonconsolidated partially-owned affiliates whose corresponding income tax expense is netted against equity income on the consolidated statements of income. The foreign tax rate differential benefits for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022 are primarily driven by losses earned in jurisdictions where the statutory rate is greater than 12.5% and by the pretax book income of nonconsolidated partially-owned affiliates whose corresponding income tax expense is netted against equity income on the consolidated statements of income, partially offset by income earned in jurisdictions where the statutory rate is greater than 12.5%.\nDeferred taxes are classified in the consolidated statements of financial position as follows:\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nOther noncurrent assets $ 253 $ 111\nOther noncurrent liabilities (206) (198)\nNet deferred tax asset/(liability)\n$ 47 $ (87)\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 88\nTemporary differences and carryforwards which gave rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities included:\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nAccrued expenses and reserves $ 135 $ 87\nEmployee and retiree benefits 25 38\nNet operating loss and other credit carryforwards 1,293 1,226\nProperty, plant and equipment 113 113\nIntangible assets 132 150\nOperating lease liabilities 55 61\nResearch and development 66 27\nOther - 2\n1,819 1,704\nValuation allowances (1,655) (1,662)\n164 42\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nUnremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries 38 35\nIndirect tax credits 10 25\nForeign currency adjustments - 8\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 55 61\nOther 14 -\n117 129\nNet deferred tax asset/(liability) $ 47 $ (87)\nAt September 30, 2023, Adient had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $4.7 billion which are available to reduce future tax liabilities. Net operating loss carryforwards of $2.4 billion will expire at various dates between 2024 and 2043, with the remainder having an indefinite carryforward period. Net operating loss carryforwards of $3.4 billion are offset by a valuation allowance.\nAdient reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or combined group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered, along with any other positive or negative evidence. All of the factors that Adient considers in evaluating whether and when to establish or release all or a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance involve significant judgment. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to Adient's valuation allowances may be necessary.\nGiven current earnings and anticipated future earnings at certain subsidiaries, Adient believes that there is a reasonable possibility that sufficient positive evidence may become available that would allow the release of all, or a portion of, valuation allowances at certain subsidiaries within the next twelve months. A release of valuation allowances, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets which could generate a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded.\nAs a result of Adient's fiscal 2023 analysis of the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence, Adient determined it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets in Mexico would be realizable and recorded an income tax benefit of $114 million to release valuation allowances. In addition, Adient determined it was necessary to release valuation allowances and establish valuation allowances in other jurisdictions that did not have a material impact on Adients financial statements. Adient continues to record valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Mexico, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom, the U.S. and other jurisdictions as it remains more likely than not that they will not be realized.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 89\nAs a result of Adient's fiscal 2022 analysis of the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence, Adient determined it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets in Canada, Japan, and other jurisdictions would not be realized and recorded income tax expense of $12 million, $3 million and $3 million, respectively, to establish valuation allowances. In addition, Adient determined it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets acquired as part of the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction would not be realized and recorded a net adjustment to goodwill of $7 million, primarily to establish valuation allowances. Additionally, Adient determined it was more likely than not that deferred tax assets in the Czech Republic and other jurisdictions would be realizable and recorded income tax benefit of $11 million and $2 million, respectively, to release valuation allowances.\nAs a result of Adients fiscal 2021 analysis of the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence, Adient determined it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets in the Czech Republic, Korea, Mexico, and other jurisdictions would not be realized and recorded income tax expense of $5 million, $5 million, $8 million, and $4 million, respectively, to establish valuation allowances.\nAdient is subject to income taxes in Ireland, the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, Adient is no longer subject to income tax examination by U.S. federal, state or local tax authorities or by non-U.S. tax authorities for years before 2014.\nAdient regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from examinations to determine the adequacy of its tax reserves. For the year ended September 30, 2023, Adient believes that it is more likely than not that the tax positions it has taken will be sustained upon the resolution of its audits resulting in no material impact on its consolidated financial statements. However, the final determination with respect to tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from Adients estimates.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, Adient had gross tax effected unrecognized tax benefits of $527 million, $499 million, and $499 million, respectively. If recognized, $167 million of Adient's unrecognized tax benefits would impact the effective tax rate. Total net accrued interest for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, was approximately $31 million, $22 million and $18 million, respectively (net of tax benefit). Adient recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nBeginning balance $ 499 $ 499 $ 483\nAdditions for tax positions related to the current year 2 62 29\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years 50 2 11\nReductions for tax positions of prior years (5) (52) (9)\nSettlements with taxing authorities (11) (3) (12)\nStatute closings (8) (9) (3)\nEnding balance $ 527 $ 499 $ 499\nDuring the next twelve months, it is likely that tax audit resolutions or applicable statute of limitation lapses could result in a significant change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. Given the number of years, jurisdictions and positions subject to examination, Adient is unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.\nAdient has recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $38 million as of September 30, 2023 on the undistributed earnings of certain consolidated and unconsolidated foreign affiliates for which Adient does not have an indefinite reinvestment assertion. Adient has not provided for deferred taxes on the remainder of undistributed earnings from consolidated foreign affiliates because such earnings should not give rise to additional tax liabilities upon repatriation or are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. It is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these earnings because the actual tax liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing when remittance occurs.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 90\nIncome taxes paid for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 were $94 million. Income taxes paid for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 were $77 million. Income taxes paid for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 were $78 million excluding $134 million of withholding taxes on the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction.\nImpacts of Tax Legislation and Change in Statutory Tax Rates\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law. Adient does not expect the provisions of the legislation to have a significant impact on the effective tax rate or the income tax payable and deferred income tax positions of Adient.\nDuring fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, other tax legislation was adopted in various jurisdictions. These law changes did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nTax Impact of One-Time Items\nDuring fiscal 2022, Adient recognized a one-time gain of $32 million associated with the retrospective recovery of indirect tax credits in Brazil resulting from Adients prioritization of those credits, resulting in net tax expense of $4 million.\nDuring fiscal 2021, Adient recognized $134 million of withholding tax expense associated with the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction. Adient also recognized tax benefits of $13 million related to the write-off of deferred tax liabilities associated with Chinese joint ventures distributions of unremitted earnings that were reinvested in a wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary. In addition, Adient recognized an additional $38 million pre-tax gain related to Brazil indirect tax credits as a result of a favorable supreme court ruling resulting in tax expense of $13 million.\n17. Segment Information\nAdient manages its business on a geographic basis and operates in the following three reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: 1) Americas, which is inclusive of North America and South America; 2) Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and 3) Asia Pacific/China (Asia).\nAdient evaluates the performance of its reportable segments using an adjusted EBITDA metric defined as income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, excluding net financing charges, restructuring and impairment costs, restructuring related-costs, net mark-to-market adjustments on pension and postretirement plans, transaction gains/losses, purchase accounting amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation and other non-recurring items. Also, certain corporate-related costs are not allocated to the segments. The reportable segments are consistent with how management views the markets served by Adient and reflect the financial information that is reviewed by its chief operating decision maker.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 91\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nNet Sales\nAmericas $ 7,220 $ 6,557 $ 6,164\nEMEA 5,195 4,764 5,564\nAsia 3,085 2,926 2,123\nEliminations (105) (126) (171)\nTotal net sales $ 15,395 $ 14,121 $ 13,680\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAmericas $ 336 $ 242 $ 232\nEMEA 232 138 277\nAsia 464 383 486\nCorporate-related costs (1)\n(94) (88) (78)\nRestructuring and impairment costs (2)\n(40) (25) (21)\nPurchase accounting amortization (3)\n(52) (54) (50)\nRestructuring related activities (4)\n2 (6) (9)\nGain on business divestitures, primarily related to the Yanfeng transaction (5)\n- - 1,188\nDepreciation\n(290) (298) (285)\nStock based compensation\n(34) (29) (36)\nOther items (6)\n(1) (4) 22\nEarnings (loss) before interest and income taxes 523 259 1,726\nNet financing charges (195) (215) (311)\nOther pension income (expense) (33) 10 24\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ 295 $ 54 $ 1,439\nNotes:\n(1) Corporate-related costs not allocated to the segments include executive office, communications, corporate development, legal and corporate finance.\n(2) Reflects restructuring charges for costs that are directly attributable to restructuring activities and meet the definition of restructuring under ASC 420 and non-recurring impairment charges.

Such modifications resulted in reductions of $25 million and $34 million in Adients cost of sales and equity income, respectively, during fiscal 2023. The modifications resulted in reductions of $14 million and $17 million in Adients cost of sales and equity income, respectively, during fiscal 2022.\n19. Commitments and Contingencies\nAdient is involved in various lawsuits, claims and proceedings incident to the operation of its businesses, including those pertaining to product liability, casualty, environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment, trade compliance, commercial and contractual matters, and various other matters. Although the outcome of any such lawsuit, claim or proceeding cannot be predicted with certainty and some may be disposed of unfavorably to Adient, it is management's opinion that none of these will have a material adverse effect on Adient's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Costs related to such matters were not material to the periods presented.\nAdient accrues for potential environmental liabilities when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable. Reserves for environmental liabilities totaled $4 million and $6 million at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Adient reviews the status of its environmental sites on a quarterly basis and adjusts its reserves accordingly. Such potential liabilities accrued by Adient do not take into consideration possible recoveries of future insurance proceeds. They do, however, take into account the likely share other parties will bear at remediation sites. It is difficult to estimate Adient's ultimate level of liability at many remediation sites due to the large number of other parties that may be involved, the complexity of determining the relative liability among those parties, the uncertainty as to the nature and scope of the investigations and remediation to be conducted, the uncertainty in the application of law and risk assessment, the various choices and costs associated with diverse technologies that may be used in corrective actions at the sites, the often quite lengthy periods over which eventual remediation may occur, and changing environmental laws. Nevertheless, Adient does not currently believe that any claims, penalties or costs in connection with known environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on Adient's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n20. Related Party Transactions\nIn the ordinary course of business, Adient enters into transactions with related parties, such as equity affiliates. Such transactions consist of the sale or purchase of goods and other arrangements.\nThe following table sets forth the location and amounts of net sales to and purchases from related parties included in Adient's consolidated statements of income (loss):\nYear Ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nNet sales to related parties Net sales $ 253 $ 247 $ 273\nPurchases from related parties Cost of sales 397 434 558\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 97\nThe following table sets forth the location and amount of accounts receivable due from and payable to related parties in Adient's consolidated statements of financial position:\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nAccounts receivable due from related parties Accounts receivable $ 26 $ 34\nAccounts payable due to related parties Accounts payable 67 95\nAverage receivable and payable balances with related parties remained consistent with the period end balances shown above.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 98 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, Adient conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2023, the end of the period covered by this report, or the Evaluation Date. Based upon the evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that Adient's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the Evaluation Date. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in Adient's reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, such as this report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to Adient's management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nDefinition of and Inherent Limitations over Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nAdient's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by Adient's board of directors, management and other personnel designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Adient's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Adient's management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of Adient's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act).
