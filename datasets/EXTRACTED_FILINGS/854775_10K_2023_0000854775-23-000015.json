    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral Background and Product Offerings\nDigi International Inc. (\"Digi\u00ae,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" or \"us\") was incorporated in 1985 as a Minnesota corporation. We reorganized as a Delaware corporation in 1989 in conjunction with our initial public offering. Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market tier of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol DGII. Our World Headquarters is located at 9350 Excelsior Blvd., Suite 700, Hopkins, Minnesota 55343. The telephone number at our World Headquarters is (952) 912-3444.\nWe are a leading global provider of business and mission-critical Internet of Things (\"IoT\") connectivity products, services and solutions. We help our customers deploy, monitor and manage critical communications infrastructures that deliver important information in demanding environments with high levels of security and reliability. We have two reportable segments under applicable accounting standards: (i) IoT Products & Services; and (ii) IoT Solutions.\nOur IoT Products & Services segment offers products and services that help original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") as well as enterprise and government customers create and deploy secure IoT connectivity solutions. These include embedded and wireless modules, console servers, enterprise and industrial routers as well as other infrastructure management equipment to meet our customers' IoT communication requirements. In addition, this segment provides our customers with a device management platform as well as other professional services to enable customers to capture and manage data from devices connected to networks.\nOur IoT Solutions segment consists of our SmartSense by Digi\u00ae business and our Managed Network-as-a-Service (MNaaS) business acquired via our November 2021 acquisition of Ventus Wireless, LLC and affiliated entities (\"Ventus\"). SmartSense by Digi offers wireless temperature and other condition-based monitoring services as well as employee task management services. These solutions focus on the following vertical markets: food service, healthcare (primarily pharmacies and hospitals) and supply chain. Ventus is a leader in the provision of MNaaS solutions that simplify the complexity of enterprise wide area network (WAN) connectivity for customers. The Ventus portfolio includes cellular wireless and fixed line WAN solutions for an array of connectivity applications in banking, healthcare, retail, gaming, hospitality and other sectors.\nFor more in-depth descriptions of our products and services, please refer to the heading \"Principal Products and Services\" at the end of Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.\nOur corporate website address is www.digi.com. In the \"Company-Investor Relations\" section of our website, we make our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, our annual proxy statement and any amendments to these reports available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). Information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC.\nIndustry and Marketplace Conditions\nWe believe the IoT industry is in the midst of a multi-year expansion as many industries are undergoing a digital transformation within their business that drives demand for IoT capabilities across a broad spectrum of services. Among others, IoT use cases include condition-based monitoring of perishable goods, enabling remote work by employees, automating workflows and operations and providing and maintaining secure connectivity and monitoring of operating assets.\nOur IoT Products & Services segment represented the majority of our sales in fiscal 2023. This segment sells both wired and wireless products that either are embedded into the products of OEMs or serve as stand-alone products. These offerings allow our customers to connect a wide range of assets to networks. This segment grew during fiscal 2023, led by increases in our OEM and Infrastructure Management revenues. Historically the revenues from this segment have been based on one-time product sales. More recently we have placed greater emphasis on selling subscription-based solutions across this product portfolio.\nOur IoT Solutions segment is comprised primarily of our SmartSense by Digi and Ventus offerings. SmartSense by Digi provides condition-based monitoring services for perishable goods such as food and medicines for the health-care, pharmaceutical and food industries. Ventus provides MNaaS offerings to manage and maintain network connectivity for assets such as ATMs and lottery kiosks. The offerings in this segment are primarily offered on a subscription model and provide us with a stable base of recurring higher-margin revenues.\nWhile our business performed well in fiscal 2023 and we expect an ongoing long-term trend of marketplace growth, each of our business segments is susceptible to downturns either because of general macro-economic conditions, the continued\ndevelopment of technology that can make products less competitive or even obsolete and uncertainty or changes in regulatory environments. Given the current uncertainty in macro-economic conditions, including, but not limited to, potential recessionary conditions, supply chain disruptions globally and the uncertain status of large project-based customer deployment opportunities, our results during fiscal 2024 may be inconsistent quarter to quarter or with historical results.\nStrategy\nWe remain focused on taking steps that we believe will deliver consistent, long-term growth with higher levels of profitability. This includes continuously reviewing and managing the product, service and solution offerings we provide to align with customer interests and meet market demand. In addition, acquisitions have helped significantly advance our offerings and driven growth and profitability, in both business segments. Over time we expect to continue to be active in making further acquisitions.\nIoT Products & Services Segment\nOur IoT Products & Services segment is managed so our product management and sales personnel are aligned along specific product lines. We believe this management structure brings greater market focus and potential growth to our product lines. We also continue to drive efforts to pair our hardware offerings with our Digi Remote Manager\u00ae device management platform as well as other support services. These bundled offerings are sold on a subscription basis and allow customers to monitor and manage the performance of our hardware remotely. This segment generated over $22 million in annualized recurring revenue (\"ARR\") as of September 30, 2023. Please see \"Key Business Metrics\" section in Part II, Item 7 for additional details on how ARR is measured.\nIoT Solutions Segment\nOur IoT Solutions segment is managed with a focus on recurring traditionally high margin subscription-based revenues. We believe capturing enterprise-level deals should be a driver of growth, leveraging our direct sales model to achieve this. Our offerings provide comprehensive hardware-enabled software solutions. The segment represents nearly 25% of total revenues. This segment generated $84 million in ARR as of September 30, 2023. We have long-term high organic growth expectations and we will continue to explore added scale through acquisitions for this segment.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nAcquisitions\nIn addition to our fiscal 2022 acquisition of Ventus disclosed above, we have made the following acquisitions during our fiscal years 2021 through 2023:\nIn March 2021, we acquired Haxiot, Inc. (\"Haxiot\u00ae\"), a provider of low power wide area (\"LPWA\") wireless technology. This acquisition enhanced our IoT Products & Services segment by enhancing Digi's embedded systems portfolio and immediately extending the company's market reach with a complete LoRaWAN-based solutions offering.\nIn July 2021, we acquired Ctek, Inc. (\"Ctek\"), a provider that specializes in solutions for remote monitoring and industrial controls. Through the acquisition of Ctek, Digi is uniquely positioned to provide customers with both battery and hardwired options for the control and monitoring of critical infrastructure, furthering Digis reach in a rapidly expanding market.\nSales Channels\nA significant portion of our IoT Products & Services segment sales are made through a global network of distributors, systems integrators and value added resellers (\"VARs\"). These third parties accounted for 59.9%, 50.0% and 47.0% of our total consolidated revenue in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our IoT Solutions segment does not sell through these channels. The remaining 40.1%, 50.0% and 53.0% of our total consolidated revenue in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively is sold through our dedicated sales organization.\nDistributors\nOur larger distributors, by sales volume, include Arrow Electronics, Avnet, Bressner Technology GmbH, Digi-Key, Express Systems & Peripherals, Ingram Micro, Mouser Electronics, Solsta, Symmetry Electronics, Synnex, Tokyo Electron Device and Venco Electr\u00f3nica S.A. We also maintain relationships with many other distributors both domestically and internationally.\nStrategic Sales Relationships\nWe maintain alliances with other industry leaders to develop and market technology solutions. These include many major communications hardware and software vendors, operating system suppliers, computer hardware manufacturers, enterprise application providers and cellular carriers. Among others, relationships include: AT&T, NXP, Orange, Rogers, Silicon Laboratories, T-Mobile, Telus, Telit, Verizon, Vodafone and several other cellular carriers worldwide.\nWe have established relationships with equipment vendors in a range of industries such as energy, industrial, retail, transportation, medical, and government that allow these partners to ship our products and services as component parts of their overall solutions. Our products utilize many of the worlds leading telecommunications companies and Internet service providers, including, among others, AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon.\nNo single customer comprised more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for any of the fiscal years 2023, 2022 or 2021. In general, our sales are not considered to be highly seasonal, although our first fiscal quarter revenue is often less than other quarters due to holidays and other business days.\nCompetition\nWe compete primarily in the communications technology industry. This industry is characterized by rapid technological advances and evolving industry standards. This market can be affected significantly by new product introductions and marketing activities of industry participants. It is possible new market entrants could market and sell disruptive technologies that impact one or more of our product or service offerings. In addition, we may compete with other companies to acquire new businesses or technologies and the competition to secure such assets may be intense. We compete for customers on the basis of existing and planned product features, service and software application capabilities, company reputation, brand recognition, technical support, alliance relationships, the quality and reliability of our offerings, product development capabilities, price and availability. While no competitor offers a comparable range of products and services, various companies do compete with us with respect to one or more of our products or solutions. With respect to many of our product and service offerings, we face competition from companies who dedicate more resources and attention to that particular offering than we are able to given the breadth of our business. As the marketplace for IoT connectivity products and solutions continues to grow, we expect to encounter increased competition. Some of these competitors may have access to significantly more financial and technical resources than we possess which could give them advantages in their ability to develop new and better offerings, to meet customer demands, to comply more quickly with new regulatory regimes and to promote and sell their products.\nManufacturing Operations\nWe outsource our manufacturing operations to certain contract manufacturers, which are located primarily in Thailand, Mexico, Taiwan and China. We rely on third party foundries or companies who rely on third party foundries for our semiconductor devices that are Application Specific Integrated Circuits (\"ASICs\"). These foundries are located primarily in Taiwan. We also outsource printed circuit board production. By outsourcing our operations to these manufacturers, we can leverage the manufacturing strength of our vendors, which allows us to focus on new product introductions. In addition, it allows us to reduce our fixed costs, maintain production flexibility and optimize our profits.\nOur products are manufactured to our designs with standard and custom components. Most of the components are available from multiple vendors. We have several single-sourced supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous to us. As disclosed elsewhere, our manufacturing operations, like those of other companies, are dependent on relationships with these suppliers who, like us, are subject to potential supply chain disruptions. If these suppliers are unable to provide a timely and reliable supply of components, we could experience manufacturing delays that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in a material way. In an effort to mitigate supply chain exposure, we have increased our amount of inventory on hand from historical levels and will monitor whether adjustments to inventory levels are necessary to mitigate any future exposures. Further, a range of conditions and circumstances beyond our control such as global conflicts, recessionary economic conditions in various regions of the world or a recurrence of the Covid-19 pandemic could disrupt the availability of raw materials and components as well as our capacity to make and distribute our products.\nResearch & Development and Intellectual Property Rights\nDue to rapidly changing technology in the communications technology industry, we believe a large part of our success depends upon the product and service development skills of our personnel as well as our ability to integrate any acquired technologies with organically developed technologies. While we dedicate significant resources to research and development, many of our competitors are focused on a smaller set of products than us and are likely able to dedicate more resources than us toward the portions of the market in which we compete with them. In recent periods, as a result of supply chain constraints, a significant portion of our research and development spending has been focused on the re-design or reconfiguration of existing products using different components. This has lowered our ability to focus on new product development.\nOur proprietary rights and technology are protected by a combination of copyrights, patents, trade secrets and trademarks.\nWe have established common law and registered trademark rights on a family of marks for a number of our products. Our IoT Products & Services primarily are sold under the Digi, Rabbit\u00ae, Digi XBee, and Opengear brands. We believe that the Digi and Rabbit brands have established strong identities with our targeted customer base and our customers associate the Digi brand with \"reliability\" and the Rabbit brand with \"ease of integration.\" We believe that our customers associate Digi XBee with \"ease of use.\" Many of our customers choose us because they are building a very complex system solution and they want the highest level in product reliability and ease of integration and use. Our IoT Solutions are offered under the Ventus and SmartSense by Digi brands.\nOur patents are applicable to specific technologies and are valid for varying periods of time based on the date of patent application or patent grant in the U.S. and the legal term of patents in the various foreign countries where patent protection is obtained. We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our company and products.\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\nDigis workforce consists of 822 employees globally as of September 30, 2023. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.\nCulture\nAt Digi we promote cultural imperatives that drive our approach to our daily work and our customer care:\nCustomer focus\nStart-up urgency\nPositive Energy - Bring solutions to problems\nCommitment to outcomes & results\nEmbrace Diversity & Inclusion\nCaring\nThese core values define the way we do business in our everyday actions and choices. We strive to create a respectful work environment characterized by mutual trust and the absence of intimidation, oppression, discrimination and exploitation.\nTalent\nSuccessful execution of our strategy is dependent on attracting, developing and retaining key employees and members of our management team. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. We continuously evaluate, modify, and enhance our internal processes and technologies to increase employee engagement, productivity, and efficiency.\nWe are committed to promoting and cultivating an inclusive, diverse culture that welcomes and celebrates everyone without bias. In addition, we actively engage within our communities to foster and attain social equity.\nCompensation Philosophy\nOur compensation philosophy creates the framework and building blocks for our rewards strategy. We have a pay-for-performance culture that ties compensation to the performance of the individual and the company. We provide balanced compensation programs that focus on the following five key elements:\nPay-for-performance - Reward and recognize leading contributors and high potentials;\nExternal market based - Pay levels that are competitive with respect to the labor market in which we compete for talent;\nInternal equity - Providing for fair pay relationships within the Company;\nFiscal responsibility - Providing affordable programs that are within our budget; and\nLegal compliance - Ensure the organization is legally compliant in all states and countries in which we operate.\nHealth and Wellness\nWe are committed to providing a competitive and comprehensive benefits package to our employees. Our benefits package provides a balance of protection along with the flexibility to meet the individual health and wellness needs of our employees.\nPRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nOur primary products and services for each reportable segment are:\nIoT Products & Services Segment\nHardware Products\nCellular Products - We provide a range of products that use cellular technology such as Long Term Evolution (LTE), LTE Advance Pro and 5th Generation wireless protocols to communicate with networks. These products provide a cost-effective, more flexible alternative to landlines for primary or backup connectivity. They are trusted by global leaders in agricultural, energy medical, lighting, digital signage, gaming, electric charging and transportation, as well as other industrial and enterprise markets including:\nCellular routers that help enterprise, government, industrial, transportation and OEM customers with their mission-critical wireless connectivity needs in challenging, remote and mobile environments.\nCellular modules that help OEM customers embed cellular communications abilities into their products so they can deploy and manage intelligent and secure cellular connected products. These modules help OEMs to get their products to market faster and with lower development costs and risks so they can focus on their core competencies instead of on wireless connectivity design.\nConsole servers that can be managed by software to provide secure, remote access to network equipment in data centers and at edge locations. These products primarily are used by IT organizations in large enterprises to maximize the availability of services to their customers and employees, and provide business continuity in the event of a network failure. This technology improves efficiency and reduces the risk of costly outages.\nRadio-Frequency (RF) Products - These products which are marketed primarily under the Digi XBee brand include embedded wireless modules as well as off-the-shelf gateways, modems and adapters. They are used by customers across a broad range of industries. These products offer a wide selection of both standards-based and proprietary wireless protocols including Zigbee, Cellular, Sub-1 GHz, LPWA, WiFi and Bluetooth to meet diverse application requirements of customers.\nEmbedded System Products - Marketed under the Digi Connect\u00ae, ConnectCore\u00ae and Rabbit brands these are embedded system on modules (\"SOMs\") and single board computers that are embedded into customer products in a broad range of industries and applications. These products deliver highly integrated computer platforms with scalable performance, flexible wired and wireless connectivity and complete software platforms. These products are designed and developed with compact form-factors, low power consumption and long product lifecycles. The latest ConnectCore products support advanced multi-core processing, security, multimedia, human-machine interface (\"HMI\") and other emerging technologies like machine learning.\nInfrastructure Management Products - These products include serial and Universal Serial Bus (\"USB\") solutions. Our serial servers (also known as device servers and terminal servers) provide secure and reliable serial port-to-Ethernet integration of most devices into wired Ethernet networks. This means that they are capable of converting data received over TCP/IP networks such as the internet and back; thereby eliminating the need for each device to have a physical connection to a computer. We also offer multiple USB solutions whose primary functions are to connect multiple USB devices, allowing them to work over a wired or wireless network without each device needing to plug into its own host computer. These products also include battery and hardwired options for the control and monitoring of critical infrastructure.\nServices\nDigi Remote Manager - Digi Remote Manager is a recurring revenue cloud-based service that provides a secure environment for customers to manage their connected device for the full deployment lifecycle. This service enables customers to activate, monitor, diagnose, reset, update and/or upgrade their entire network of mission-critical devices from a single point of command. Through a \"single pane of glass,\" network managers can manage configurations, update firmware, add features and schedule and automate tasks from their desktop, tablet or phone.\nLighthouse\u00ae Management Software - Lighthouse is a recurring revenue cloud-based service that provides a secure environment for customers to manage their network devices by providing secure access to remote networks regardless of how they are connected or how a user interacts with the system. Designed with security, scalability and automation in mind, Lighthouse allows engineers to control every aspect of their network through a central hub.\nTechnical Services - Our Technical Services provide professional services, data plan subscriptions and enhanced technical support to customers. Professional services include solution planning and implementation services to customers who purchase our products such as site planning, implementation management, application development and customer training. Data plan subscriptions are offered to customers wishing to enable cellular connectivity on our products. Enhanced technical support provides priority, in-depth technical support consultations with our experienced support team. These services ensure customers get to market quickly, minimize risk, and ensure customer success with their Digi solution.\nIoT Solutions Segment\nSmartSense by Digi - Our SmartSense by Digi is an end-to-end, cost-effective system that uses sensors, gateways and cloud based applications to enable customers in food service (e.g. super markets, schools and restaurants), healthcare (primarily pharmacies and hospitals) and transportation/logistics to: (i) monitor wirelessly the temperature of food and other perishable or sensitive goods, (ii) monitor facilities or pharmacies by tracking the completion of operating tasks by employees, and (iii) have visibility in the supply chain to product temperature through an end-to-end system for quality control and incident management. Historically, customers receive hardware up-front, including gateways and sensors, and pay for an annual subscription for monitoring sensor data. However. SmartSense by Digi is increasingly pivoting to providing a comprehensive Sensing-as-a-service solution to better address customers' needs and expand its role as a leader in this solution space.\nVentus - Ventus is a leader in providing comprehensive MNaaS solutions that simplify the complexity of both wireless and fixed-line WAN connectivity. With comprehensive end-to-end security, our portfolio includes an array of connectivity applications in the banking, healthcare, retail, gaming, access control, EV charging, hospitality and other sectors. Supporting ATMs, gaming, point-of-sale, kiosks, digital signage and retail applications, Ventus works closely with its customers to customize innovative long-term MNaaS solutions. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nMultiple risk factors exist which could have a material effect on our operations, results of operations, financial position, liquidity, capital resources and common stock.\nOperational Risks\nWe depend on manufacturing relationships and a broad set of suppliers, some of whom provide us with limited-source components and parts, and disruptions in these relationships may cause damage to our customer relationships or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nWe procure all parts and certain services involved in the production of our products and subcontract most of our product manufacturing to outside firms that specialize in such services. Although most of the components of our products are available from multiple vendors, we have several single-source supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous to us. As an example, Ventus relies almost exclusively on a manufacturer in China for the production of the hardware it provides to its customers. Further, in recent years supply chains globally have experienced\nstress due to a range of factors. This continues to impact our own ability to procure certain inventory and services. These disruptions also caused us to order significant amounts of inventory as we were uncertain whether we would otherwise be able to procure necessary parts and components to meet customer needs. As a result, we have held elevated levels of inventory compared to historical norms. The impacts of these circumstances driven by supply chain stress have been material in some instances and it is possible additional material impacts could occur in the future. There can be no assurance that our suppliers will be able to meet our future requirements for products and components in a timely fashion. In addition, the availability of many of the components we need is dependent in part on our ability to provide our suppliers with accurate forecasts of our future requirements. Delays or lost revenue could be caused by other factors beyond our control, including late deliveries by vendors of components, or force majeure events. As an example of force majeure, a fire in November 2014 disrupted the operations at one of our contract manufacturers in Thailand. If we are required to identify alternative suppliers for any of our required components, qualification and pre-production periods could be lengthy and may cause an increase in component costs and delays in providing products to customers. Any extended interruption in the supply of any of the key components or the availability of manufacturing services that currently are obtained from limited sources could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our customer relationships and profitability.\nThe long and variable sales cycle for certain of our products and services makes it more difficult for us to predict our operating results and manage our business.\nThe sale of our products and services may require a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by potential customers and end users, as well as delays frequently associated with end users internal procedures to deploy new technologies and to test and accept new technologies. For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with certain of our products is typically lengthy and is subject to a number of significant risks, such as end users internal purchasing reviews, as well as availability of capital for deployments, that are beyond our control. Because of the lengthy sales cycle and the large size of certain customer orders, if orders forecasted for a specific customer are not realized or delayed, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur participation in a services and solutions model, using hardware and cloud-based services, presents execution and competitive risks.\nWe participate in a services and solutions model that uses both hardware and cloud-based services. Both our SmartSense by Digi and Ventus offerings deploy hardware, software and cloud-based hosting. In other areas of our business we offer hosted services and cloud-based platform, software applications, and supporting products and services. We also employ significant human and financial resources to develop and deploy these offerings. As we work to grow and scale these offerings, these investments have impacted previously and may impact adversely in the future our gross margins and profitability. While we believe we have a strong foundation to compete, it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to be successful. Certain customers and potential customers that use these offerings were adversely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting global economic downturn. Any future economic slowdown could impede our ability to win and retain customers. We have and expect to encounter competition from other solutions providers, some of whom may have more significant resources than us. Whether we are successful in this business model depends on a number of factors, including:\nour ability to establish the infrastructure to deploy and evolve our solutions effectively and continuously;\nthe features and functionality of our offerings relative to competing offerings as well as our ability to market effectively;\nour ability to engage in successful strategic relationships with third parties such as telecommunications carriers, component makers and systems integrators;\nour ability to meet service assurance commitments required by certain contracts;\ncompeting effectively for market share; and\ndeploying complete end-to-end solutions that meet the needs of the marketplace generally as well as the particular requirements of our customers more effectively and efficiently than competitive solutions.\nOur ability to sustain and grow our business depends in large part on the success of our third party distributors and resellers.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is generated through sales by third party distributors and resellers. Further, for several years we have been taking steps to expand our relationship with certain distributors who have global reach. These expansion efforts may increase the percent of our revenue driven through channel partners or heighten our reliance on certain channel partners to drive sales. To the extent our channel partners are unsuccessful selling our products or if we are unable to obtain and retain a sufficient number of high-quality channel partners, our operating results could be affected materially and adversely. In addition, our distributors and resellers may market, sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours, and\nthey may devote more resources to the marketing, sales and support of such products. These distributors and resellers may have incentives to promote our competitors products in lieu of our products, particularly for our competitors with larger volumes of orders, more diverse product offerings and longer relationships with our distributors and resellers. It is possible one or more of our important distributors and resellers may stop selling our products completely. Our distributor and reseller sales structure could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability and reputational harm if, for example, any of these parties misrepresents the functionality of our products or services to customers, or violates laws or our corporate policies. If we fail to manage our existing or future sales through distributors and resellers effectively, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nAcquisitions could disrupt our business and seriously harm our financial condition.\nWe will continue to consider acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies. In the event of any future acquisitions, we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership, incur additional debt, assume liabilities or incur large and immediate write-offs.\nOur operation of any acquired business also involves numerous risks, including but not limited to:\nproblems combining the acquired operations, technologies, or products;\nunanticipated costs;\ndiversion of managements attention from our core business;\ndifficulties integrating businesses in different countries and cultures;\neffectively implementing internal control over financial reporting;\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\nrisks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; and\npotential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired business\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses, products, technologies, or personnel that we have acquired or that we might acquire in the future. Any such integration failure could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, from time to time, we may enter into negotiations for a proposed acquisition, but be unable or unwilling to consummate the acquisition under consideration. This could cause significant diversion of managements attention and out-of-pocket expenses for us. We could also be exposed to litigation as a result of any consummated or unconsummated acquisition.\nCertain parts of our business are subject to customer concentrations.\nSeveral of our acquired businesses historically have depended on relationships with one or a small number of customers or have a significant number of customers that are from particular industries. Any disruption in their business with those customers, whether as a result of changes in demand for the customers services, adverse changes in the customers industry generally or other challenges in securing or renewing contracts, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nFor example, we acquired Accelerated in fiscal 2018. Although Accelerated has many customers, its business historically has been highly dependent on its relationship with a single telecommunications carrier customer.\nWe acquired Opengear in fiscal 2019. Although Opengear has many customers, its business historically has been significantly concentrated on its relationships with a few large customers.\nWe acquired Ventus in fiscal 2022. Although Ventus has many customers, its business historically has been significantly concentrated on its relationships with fewer than twenty customers and it also serves a significant number of customers in the financial and gaming terminal industries. Likewise, our SmartSense by Digi business services a significant number of customers in the pharmaceutical, medical facility and retail food industries. Both Ventus and SmartSense by Digi produce significant ARR. Any disruption or difficulties in any of the industries these businesses serve could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations (including, but not limited to, ARR), financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, some larger customers may demand discounts and rebates. As a result, our future revenue opportunities with these customers may be limited, and we may face pricing pressures, which in turn could adversely impact our gross margin and our profitability. The loss of, reduction in, or pricing discounts associated with orders from key customers may significantly reduce our revenue and harm our business. Furthermore, delays in payment and/or extended payment terms from larger customers\ncould have a disproportionate and material negative impact on our cash flows and working capital to support our business operations.\nThe businesses of our IoT Solutions segment are subject to the risks faced by businesses operating in emerging markets.\nSmartSense by Digi is operated in an emerging market where technology-based solutions to monitor the condition of perishable goods as well as the completion of employee tasks have not been used historically. Similarly, our Ventus business is operating in an evolving marketplace where the breadth of companies with collections of assets that require connectivity and general monitoring is evolving. The operation of each of these businesses can therefore be subject to significant additional risks that are not necessarily related to our more established products and services.\nAdditional risks that relate to IoT Solutions, include, but are not limited to:\nSmartSense by Digi offerings are deployed in part to help assure perishable goods are safely preserved. Ventus's offering is deployed so that dispersed collections of critical, operational assets requiring network connectivity (such as ATMs, lottery terminals, etc.) are fully operational. In each case, there is a potential risk of loss in the event of a malfunction or failure in our offerings.\nSmartSense by Digi has a limited history with us in a marketplace that is relatively early in its development and has numerous competitors. Although Ventus has a longer operating history and some of the marketplaces in which it operates are quite mature, new use cases continue to emerge as businesses increasingly rely on self-service devices in their operations with customers. We cannot provide assurances we will be successful in operating and continuing to grow either of these businesses.\nOur ability to succeed with the offerings of these businesses will depend in large part on our ability to provide customers with hardware and software products that are easy to deploy and offer features and functionality that address the needs of particular businesses. We may face challenges and delays in the development of these businesses as the marketplace for products and services evolves to meet the needs and desires of customers.\nIn light of these risks and uncertainties, we may not be able to establish or maintain the market share of these businesses or take full advantage of businesses we may acquire in the future related to either of these businesses. There can be no assurance that we will recover our investments in SmartSense by Digi or Ventus or that we will realize ongoing and consistent profits from these businesses. Also, there can be no assurance that diverting our managements attention to these businesses will not have a material adverse effect on our other existing businesses, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to claims and litigation regarding intellectual property rights or other claims pertaining to our business, which could seriously harm us and require us to incur significant costs.\nThe communications technology industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, we receive notification of a third-party claim that our products allegedly infringe intellectual property rights owned by others. In addition, in the ordinary course of business from time to time we receive other third-party claims that may include, but are not limited to, commercial relationships, employment disputes, contractual disputes or alleged issues with the use of our products or services. Any litigation to determine the validity of third-party infringement claims or other litigation claims made against us, whether or not determined in our favor or settled by us, may be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from productive tasks. This could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and service the needs of our customers. There can be no assurance that any claims by third parties, regardless if they have merit, will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition or prospects. In the event of an adverse ruling in any such matter, we may be required to pay substantial damages, cease engaging in or make alterations to certain business activities, cease the manufacture, use and sale of infringing products, discontinue the use of certain processes or be required to obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement. There can be no assurance with respect to an infringement claim that a license would be available on reasonable terms or at all. Any limitations on our ability to market our products, or delays and costs associated with redesigning our products or payments of license fees to third parties, or any failure by us to develop or license a substitute technology on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur sales and operations globally face risks related to health epidemics or pandemics that could disrupt our operations and adversely impact our sales and operating results.\nOur business operations and financial results could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease or other material adverse widespread public health development, such as the outbreak of the Covid-19 respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in 2019. These effects could include the absence of one or more key employees or significant numbers or employees generally, disruptions or restrictions on our ability to maintain operations at one or more of our facilities, disruptions or restrictions to travel that is important to our operations, adverse impacts on our ability to distribute or deliver our products or services as well as temporary disruptions, restrictions or closures of the facilities of our suppliers or customers and their contract manufacturers. Any of the above absences, disruptions or restrictions could impact our sales and operating results negatively. If these absences, disruptions or restrictions are significant and material it is possible our business continuity could be jeopardized. Depending on the location of any such disruption or restriction, there may not be a solution that will be easy to implement in a timely manner or without significant expense. In addition, any significant outbreak of contagious diseases could materially and adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries or the entire world, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products, likely impact our operating results and restrain our access to capital from lenders or other sources.\nRisks Relating to Our Foreign Operations\nOur use of suppliers in other parts of the world as well as our purchases of components containing certain materials involves risks that could negatively impact us.\nWe purchase many components from suppliers in other parts of the world. Product delivery times may be extended due to the distances involved or events beyond our control, requiring more lead time in ordering. In addition, ocean freight delays may occur as a result of labor problems, weather delays, expediting orders for third parties, customs issues or other events beyond our control. Any extended delay in receipt of the component parts could eliminate anticipated cost savings and have a material adverse effect on our customer relationships and profitability. Governments continue to impose tariffs on various products and components which may impact the pricing of certain components and inventories and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive standing in the marketplace and our financial results. Potential power outages, most notably in recent times in Asia and Europe could also have a material adverse effect ability to obtain components for our products from our foreign suppliers. Additional challenges could occur if these suppliers allocate materials and components to other customers. The Chinese government in recent years has implemented policies that adversely have impacted various industries in that nation and it is possible they may take actions in the future that are adverse to suppliers who we rely upon. Sanctions against and actions of the Russian government resulting from the war in Ukraine may be adverse to suppliers who we rely upon. Finally, the introduction of new regulations by governments may also impact the availability, delivery or certain components or our ability to use certain components because of, among other potential reasons, the materials those components may contain or the location of the supplier of the component or certain materials contained in the component.\nWe face risks associated with our international operations that could impair our ability to grow our revenue abroad as well as our overall financial condition.\nOur future growth may be dependent in part upon our ability to increase sales in international markets. These sales are subject to a variety of risks, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, tariffs, import restrictions and other trade barriers, unexpected or very burdensome changes in regulatory requirements, longer accounts receivable payment cycles, potentially adverse tax consequences, and export license requirements. In addition, we are subject to the risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including political and economic instability and unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships. In many markets where we operate business and cultural norms are different than those in the United States and practices that may violate laws and regulations applicable to us like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and the UK Anti-Bribery Act (\"UKBA\") are more commonplace. Although we have implemented policies and procedures with the intention of ensuring compliance with these laws and regulations, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as channel partners involved in our international sales, may take actions in violation of our policies. Many of our vendors and strategic business allies also have international operations and are subject to the above described risks. Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if one or more of our business relations are not able to successfully manage these risks. There can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business strategy and financial condition.\nOur failure to comply effectively with regulatory laws pertaining to our foreign operations could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.\nWe are required to comply with U.S. government export regulations in the sale of our products to foreign customers, including requirements to properly classify and screen our products against a denied parties list prior to shipment. We are also required to comply with the provisions of the FCPA and all other anti-corruption laws, such as UKBA, of all other countries in which we do business, directly or indirectly, including compliance with the anti-bribery prohibitions and the accounting and recordkeeping requirements of this law. Violations of export regulations, the FCPA or other similar laws or other laws and regulations could trigger sanctions, including ineligibility for U.S. government insurance and financing, as well as large fines.\nFailure to comply with the aforementioned regulations could also deter us from selling our products in international jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.\nCompetitive and Reputational Risks\nWe face intense competition from established companies that may have significant advantages over us and our products.\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive. Certain of our competitors and potential competitors have or may develop greater financial, technological, manufacturing, marketing and personnel resources than us either generally or relative to the product sets they sell in competition to us. Further, there are numerous companies competing with us in various segments of the market for our products, and their products may have advantages over our products in areas such as conformity to existing and emerging industry standards or new regulations, interoperability with other products, management and security capabilities, performance, price, ease of use, scalability, reliability, flexibility, product features and technical support.\nOur current and potential competitors have or may develop one or more of the following significant advantages over us in the product areas where they compete with us:\ntighter focus on an individual product or product category;\ngreater financial, technical and marketing resources;\nbarriers to transition to our products;\nhigher brand recognition across larger geographic regions;\nmore comprehensive product features and functionality;\nlonger-standing cooperative relationships with OEM and end-user customers;\nsuperior customer service capacity and quality;\nlonger operating history; and\nlarger customer base.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with our current and potential competitors. Such competitors may be able to more quickly develop or adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, changes in regulatory requirements or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products. Additionally, it is probable that new competitors or new alliances among existing competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.\nOur dependence on new product development and the rapid technological change that characterizes our industry make us susceptible to loss of market share resulting from competitors product introductions and enhancements, service capabilities and similar risks as well as from regulatory changes.\nOur industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles in certain instances and rapidly changing customer requirements. The introduction of products and enhancements embodying new technologies that can disrupt one or more markets in which we compete and the emergence of new industry standards or regulations impacting our industry can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products, to introduce new products to meet changing customer requirements and emerging technologies as well as potential regulatory changes, and to demonstrate the performance advantages and cost-effectiveness of our products over competing products. Failure by us to modify our products to support new alternative technologies or failure to achieve widespread customer acceptance of such modified products could cause us to lose market share and cause our revenue to decline. Further, if our competitors offer better service capabilities associated with the implementation and use of their products, our business could be impacted negatively.\nWe may experience delays in developing and marketing product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change, evolving industry standards or regulations and changing customer requirements. There can be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction, and marketing of these products or product enhancements, or that our new products and product enhancements will meet the requirements of the marketplace adequately and achieve any significant or sustainable degree of market acceptance in existing or additional markets. In addition, the future introductions or announcements of products by us or one of our competitors embodying new technologies or changes in industry standards or regulations or customer requirements could render our then-existing products\nobsolete or unmarketable. This risk may become more pronounced as new competitors emerge in markets where we sell our products, especially if these competitors have more resources than us to develop and market new products and technologies and provide related services. There can be no assurance that the introduction or announcement of new product offerings by us or one or more of our competitors will not cause customers to defer their purchase of our existing products, which could cause our revenue to decline.\nOur failure to compete successfully in our highly competitive market could result in reduced prices and loss of market share.\nThe market in which we operate is characterized by rapid technological advances and evolving industry standards. The market can be affected significantly by new product introductions and marketing activities of industry participants. In addition, the amount of competition we face in the marketplace may change and grow as the market for our industry grows and new entrants enter the marketplace. Present and future competitors may be able to identify new markets and develop products more quickly, which are superior to those developed by us. Such competitors may adapt new technologies faster, devote greater resources to research and development, promote products more aggressively and price products more competitively than us. Competition may also intensify, or we may no longer be able to compete effectively in the markets in which we compete.\nStrategic Risks\nWe intend to continue to devote significant resources to our research and development, which, if not successful, could cause a decline in our revenue and harm our business.\nWe intend to continue to devote significant resources to research and development in the coming years to enhance our existing product offerings and develop additional product offerings. For fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, our research and development expenses were 13.2%, 14.2% and 15.1% of our revenue. If we are unable to enhance existing products and develop new products, applications and services as a result of our research and development efforts, if we encounter delays in deploying these enhanced or new products, applications and services, or if the products, applications and services we enhance or develop are not successful, our business could be harmed. Even if we enhance existing products and develop new products, applications and services that are accepted by our target markets, the net revenue from these products, applications and services may not be sufficient to justify our investment in research and development.\nMany of our products, applications and services have been developed through a combination of internally developed technologies and acquired technologies. Our ability to continue to develop products, applications and services could be partially dependent on finding and acquiring new technologies in the marketplace. Even if we identify new technologies that we believe would be complementary to our internally developed technologies, we may not be successful in obtaining those technologies or integrating them effectively with our existing technologies.\nOur ability to grow our business is dependent in part on strategic relationships we develop and maintain with third parties as well as our ability to integrate and assure use of our products and services in coordination with the products and services of certain strategic partners in a commercially acceptable manner.\nWe believe that our ability to increase our sales depends in part on maintaining and strengthening relationships with parties such as telecommunications carriers, systems integrators, enterprise application providers, component providers and other strategic technology companies. Once a relationship is established, we likely will dedicate significant time and resources to it in an effort to advance our business interests and there is no assurance any strategic relationship will generate enough revenue to offset the significant resources we use to advance the relationship. Parties with whom we establish strategic relationships also work with companies that compete with us. We have limited, if any, control as to whether these parties devote adequate resources to promoting, selling, and implementing our products. Further, new or emerging technologies, technological trends or changes in customer requirements may result in certain companies with whom we maintain strategic relationships de-emphasizing their dealings with us or becoming potential competitors in the future. We also have limited, if any, control as to other business activities of these parties and we could experience reputational harm because of our association with such parties if they fail to execute on business initiatives, are accused of breaking the law or otherwise suffer reputational harm for other reasons. All of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nIn some cases, we expect the establishment of a strategic relationship with a third party to result in integrations of our products or services with those of other parties. Identifying appropriate parties for these relationships as well as negotiating and documenting business agreements with them requires significant time and resources. We expect these agreements typically to be non-exclusive and not to prohibit the other party from working with our competitors or offering competing services. Once the relationship is established, we may encounter difficulties in combining our products and services in a commercially acceptable manner. We expect this dynamic, where our ability to generate sales is dependent on our products and services interacting with those sold by third parties, may become more common in the future. There can be no guarantee in any\nparticular instance that we will be successful in making our products interact with those of other parties in a commercially acceptable manner and, even if we do, we cannot guarantee that the resulting products and services will be marketed effectively or sold via the relationship.\nOur failure to anticipate or manage product transitions effectively could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.\nFrom time to time, we or our competitors may announce new or enhanced products that may replace or shorten the life cycles of our existing products. Announcements of currently planned or other new or enhanced products may cause customers to defer or stop purchasing our products until these products become available. Furthermore, the introduction of new or enhanced products because of customer requirement, regulation or otherwise may require us to manage the transition from older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new or enhanced products can be delivered to meet customer demand. Our failure to anticipate the revenue declines associated with older products or manage transitions from older products effectively could result in inventory obsolescence and also have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.\nWe are dependent on third parties to manufacture our products which could have adverse impacts on our business if such manufacturers encounter operating restraints or if we do not properly forecast customer demand.\nWe are reliant on third parties to manufacture our products in countries such as Mexico, Thailand, Taiwan and China. The ability of these manufacturers to provide us with the timely provision of finished products is subject to a number of disruptions beyond their control such as, among others: the availability of components from suppliers, labor shortages, energy shortages such as those from time to time encountered in China, changes in government regulations, tensions with foreign governments or other factors. If we do not properly forecast customer demands for products any lengthening in lead times or disruptions in service could result in lost revenues and adversely impact our business, results of operation, financial condition and prospects.\nThe loss of key personnel could prevent us from executing our business strategy.\nOur business and prospects depend to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our executive officers and key technical and other personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and in the current environment of large numbers of workers leaving their current employment for new opportunities, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining qualified personnel. Failure to attract and retain key personnel could result in our failure to execute our business strategy.\nRisks Related to Economic and Market Conditions\nOur consolidated operating results and financial condition may be adversely impacted by worldwide economic conditions and credit tightening.\nIf worldwide economic conditions experience a significant downturn, these conditions may make it difficult or impossible for our customers and suppliers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, which may cause them to slow or suspend spending on products and services. Our customers or suppliers may find it difficult to gain sufficient credit or service existing credit in a timely manner, which could result in an impairment of their ability to process or place orders with us, deliver inventory or services to us in the case of suppliers or to make timely payments to us for previous purchases in the case of customers. If this occurs, our revenue may be reduced, thereby having a negative impact on our results of operations. In addition, we may be forced to increase our allowance for credit losses and our days sales outstanding may increase, which would have a negative impact on our cash position, liquidity and financial condition. To the extent we incur debt, we may be unable to adhere to financial covenants or to service the debt. These risks associated with credit and debt are more pronounced for the parties with whom we do business and ourselves in the current environment which has seen interest rates rise rapidly, especially if they remain elevated for an extended period of time We cannot predict either the timing or duration of an economic downturn in the economy, should one occur. Any downturn could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur gross margins may be subject to decline.\nOur gross margins may be subject to declines which could decrease our overall profitability and impact our financial performance adversely. Some of the hardware products we sell are approaching the end of their product life cycles. These mature hardware products have sold historically at higher gross margins than our other product and service offerings. We expect this general trend of declining sales for many of our mature products to continue and the pace of the decline may accelerate. In addition, rising prices for goods and services due to inflation along with ongoing cost pressures in our industry create downward pressure on the prices at which we and other manufacturers can sell hardware products. We have indicated\nthat we would be willing to realize lower levels of gross margins from customers in return for long-term, binding purchase commitments. If this strategy were successful, it could apply downward pressure on our gross margins. Part of our longer term strategy is to sell software applications and IoT solutions such as SmartSense by Digi and Ventus offerings as well as selling hardware together with bundled services on a subscription basis. These sales may provide recurring revenues at relatively high gross margins, but these types of offerings are still in the earlier stages of adoption by customers. As such, their sales growth is not necessarily predictable or assured. Our gross margins therefore may be subject to decline unless we can implement cost reduction initiatives effectively to offset the impact of these factors.\nOur revenue may be subject to fluctuations based on the level of significant large project-based purchases.\nNo single customer has represented more than 10% of our revenue in any of the last three fiscal years. However, many of our customers make significant one-time hardware purchases for large projects that are not repeated. As a result, our revenue may be subject to significant fluctuations based on whether we are able to close significant project based sales opportunities. In addition, in our SmartSense by Digi and Ventus businesses certain customers have outsized deployments relative to other customers. It is possible we will see revenue fluctuations in these businesses based upon the scale of new deployments in different financial periods. Our failure to complete one or a series of significant sales opportunities in a particular fiscal period could have a material adverse effect on our revenue for that period.\nSome of our products are sold into mature markets, which could limit our ability to continue to generate revenue from these products.\nSome of our hardware products are sold into mature markets that are characterized by a trend of declining demand. We have made targeted investments to provide enhanced and new products into these mature markets and believe this may mitigate declining demand. However, over the longer term, the overall market for these hardware products is expected to decrease due to the adoption of new technologies. As such, we expect that our revenue from these products will continue to decline over time. As a result, our future prospects depend in part on our ability to acquire or develop and successfully market additional products that address growth markets.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results.\nOur future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or our interpretation of such laws. In addition, we may be subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other U.S. and international tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and financial condition.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, including our reserves for uncertain tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nCredit and Liquidity Risks\nFailure to comply with the covenants under our credit facility may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access additional capital and/or create an event of default.\nOn December 22, 2021, Digi entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement, which amended and restated the second amended and restated credit agreement entered into on November 1, 2021, consisting of a $350 million term loan B secured loan (the \"Term Loan\") and a $35 million revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\", and together with the Term Loan, the \"Loan\"). This Loan replaced our syndicated senior secured credit agreement with BMO that was entered into on March 15, 2021 and replaced the remaining balances of our term loan and revolver. The $35 million revolving credit facility, which presently is undrawn, includes a $10 million letter of credit subfacility and $10 million swingline subfacility. Amounts under the Term Loan are being repaid in quarterly installments on the last day of each fiscal quarter, with an annual\namortization rate of 5% of the original aggregate principal amount of the term loans, commencing on June 30, 2022. The remaining outstanding balance under the Term Loan is due to be repaid in full after seven years.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the Loan, we will be in default. We are also required to comply with several financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. Our ability to comply with such financial covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, which could result in a default under the Credit Agreement; such default may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\nThe Term Loan contains some affirmative covenants and the Revolving Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of Digi and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, dispose of significant assets, make certain investments, including any acquisitions other than permitted acquisitions, make certain payments, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, grant liens on its assets or rate management transactions, subject to certain limitations. These restrictions could adversely affect our business.\nNegative conditions in the global credit markets may impair a portion of our investment portfolio.\nOur investment portfolio may consist of certificates of deposit, commercial paper, money market funds, corporate bonds and government municipal bonds. These marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair market value. Some of our investments could experience reduced liquidity and could result in an impairment charge should the impairment be considered as other-than-temporary. This loss would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations, which could materially adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nTechnology and Cybersecurity Risks\nWe are subject to various cybersecurity risks, which are particularly acute in cloud-based technologies that we and other third parties operate that form a part of our solutions or that we rely on to conduct our operations. These risks may increase our costs and could damage our brand and reputation.\nAs we continue to direct a substantial portion of our sales and development efforts toward broader based solutions, such as SmartSense by Digi, the Digi Remote Manager and Ventus offerings, we expect to store, convey and potentially process significant amounts of data produced by devices. We have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years and have inherited a range of different systems that store, convey and potentially process data and in some cases we may be delayed or choose not to integrate these systems into similar systems used in other parts of our business. Further many of our business applications that we rely upon to operate our business now exist within cloud platforms that are managed by third parties. These factors may add to the risk of breach by third parties.\nThis data may include confidential or proprietary information, intellectual property or personally identifiable information of our customers or other third parties with whom they do business. It is important for us to maintain solutions and related infrastructure that are perceived by our customers and other parties with whom we do business as providing reasonable levels of reliability and security. Despite available security measures and other precautions, the infrastructure and transmission methods used by our products and services or otherwise associated with our operations may be vulnerable to interception, attack or other disruptive problems. Continued high-profile data breaches at other companies evidence an external environment that is becoming increasingly hostile to information security. Improper disclosure of data or a perception that our data security is insufficient could harm our reputation, give rise to legal proceedings or subject our company to liability under laws that protect data, which may evolve and expand in scope over time. Any of these factors could result in increased costs and loss of revenue for us.\nIf a cyberattack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customers data or our own data, whether due to a failure with our systems or related systems operated by third parties, we could suffer damage to our brand and reputation.\nThe costs we would incur to address and fix these incidents could significantly increase our expenses. These types of security incidents could also lead to lawsuits, regulatory investigations and increased legal liability, including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraud monitoring. Further, as the regulatory focus on privacy and data security issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the protection of information continue to become more complex, the potential risks and costs of compliance to our business are expected to intensify.\nOur products operate with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, reduced revenue, liability claims or damage to our reputation or competitive position.\nIn addition, cybersecurity is an issue that is becoming increasingly regulated. As regulations take effect or evolve it is possible we may encounter issues being fully compliant with these legal standards which could result in material adverse effects on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to compete could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights.\nOur ability to compete depends in part on our proprietary rights and technology. Our proprietary rights and technology are protected by a combination of copyrights, patents, trade secrets and trademarks. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, and sometimes with our customers, potential customers and other third parties, and limit access to the distribution of our proprietary information. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us in this regard will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation of our technology. Our pending patent applications may be denied and any patents, once issued, may be circumvented by our competitors. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are superior to our technologies. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States. There can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States or abroad will be adequate or that competing companies will not independently develop similar technologies. Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and our business.\nGovernment and Political Risks\nOur inability to obtain the appropriate telecommunications carrier certifications or approvals from governmental regulatory bodies could impede our ability to grow revenue in our wireless products.\nThe sale of our wireless products in certain geographical markets is sometimes dependent on the ability to gain telecommunications carrier certifications and/or approvals by certain governmental bodies. Failure to obtain these approvals, or delays in receiving the approvals, could impact our ability to enter our targeted markets or to compete effectively or at all in these markets and could have an adverse impact on our business and prospects.\nOur failure to comply effectively with the requirements of applicable legislation and regulation, including but not limited to environmental rules and regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.\nProduction and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject us to environmental and other regulations. In addition, certain states and countries may pass new regulations requiring our products to meet certain requirements to use environmentally friendly components or to avoid the procurement of materials and components from certain places in the world. For instance, the European Union has issued two directives relating to chemical substances in electronic products. The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive makes producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment financially responsible for collection, reuse, recycling, treatment and disposal of equipment placed in the European Union market. The Restrictions of Hazardous Substances Directive bans the use of certain hazardous materials in electric and electrical equipment which are put on the market in the European Union. In the future, various governments may adopt further environmental compliance programs or other rules or regulations that may impact our business operations. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we may not be able to sell our products in jurisdictions where these regulations apply, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nUnsolicited takeover proposals, governance change proposals, proxy contests and resulting litigation may adversely impact our operations, create uncertainty and affect the market price and volatility of our securities.\nIn 2017, we received an unsolicited takeover proposal and other companies in our industry have been the target of unsolicited takeover proposals in the past. In the event that a third party, such as a competitor, private equity firm or activist investor makes an unsolicited takeover proposal or proposes to change our governance policies or board of directors, or makes other proposals concerning our ownership structure or operations, our review and consideration of such proposals may be a significant distraction for our management and employees, and could require us to expend significant time and resources. Such proposals may create uncertainty for our employees and this uncertainty may adversely affect our ability to retain key\nemployees, to hire new talent or to complete acquisitions we may desire to make. Similar uncertainty among our customers, suppliers and other business partners could cause them to terminate, or not to renew or enter into, arrangements with us. Certain proposals may result in costly proxy contests or litigation that can disrupt our business operations or result in an adverse effect on our operating results. Management and employee distraction related to any such proposals also may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business optimally and pursue our strategic objectives. Such proposals, or their withdrawal, could create uncertainty among investors and potential investors as to our future direction and affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operational or financial performance.\nCertain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and our charter documents have an anti-takeover effect.\nThere exist certain mechanisms under the Delaware General Corporation Law and our charter documents that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control. For instance, under Delaware law, we are prohibited from engaging in certain business combinations with interested stockholders for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless certain requirements are met, and majority stockholder approval is required for certain business combination transactions with interested parties.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation contains a \"fair price\" provision requiring majority stockholder approval for certain business combination transactions with interested parties, and this provision may not be changed without the vote of at least 80% of the outstanding shares of our voting stock. Other mechanisms in our charter documents may also delay, defer or prevent a change of control. For instance, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that our Board of Directors has authority to issue series of our preferred stock with such voting rights and other powers as the Board of Directors may determine. Furthermore, we have a classified board of directors, which means that our directors are divided into three classes that are elected to three-year terms on a staggered basis. Since the three-year terms of each class overlap the terms of the other classes of directors, the entire board of directors cannot be replaced in any one year. Under Delaware law, directors serving on a classified board may not be removed by shareholders except for cause. The effect of these anti-takeover provisions may deter business combination transactions not approved by our Board of Directors, including acquisitions that may offer a premium over the market price to some or all stockholders.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate in the future.\nThe market price of our common stock, like that of many other high-technology companies, has fluctuated significantly and is likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. During fiscal 2023, the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market ranged from $27.00 to $42.94 per share. Our closing sale price on November 20, 2023 was $25.29 per share. Announcements by us or others regarding the receipt of customer orders, quarterly variations in operating results, departures of key personnel, acquisitions or divestitures, additional equity or debt financings, results of customer field trials, scientific discoveries, technological innovations, litigation, product developments, patent or proprietary rights, government regulation and general market conditions and risks may, for example, have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock.\nIf our stock price declines over a sustained period of time, our profits significantly decrease or our acquired businesses do not attain results that were anticipated at the time of acquisition, we may need to recognize an impairment of our goodwill.\nThe price of our common stock could decline. If such a decline continued over a sustained period of time, we could have an impairment of our goodwill. Our market value is dependent upon certain factors, including continued future growth of our products, services and solutions. If such growth does not materialize or our forecasts are not met (including forecasts established at the time of acquisition), our profits could be significantly reduced, and our market value may decline, which could result in an impairment of our goodwill. As discussed in other risk factors, there could be circumstances beyond our control that could exacerbate the conditions that would lead to such an impairment.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nWe are dependent on wireless communication networks owned and controlled by others.\nOur revenue could decline if we are unable to deliver continued access to digital cellular wireless carriers that we depend on to provide sufficient network capacity, reliability and security to our customers. Our financial condition could be impacted if our wireless carriers increase the prices of their services or suffer operational or technical failures.\nNatural disasters, wars and other events beyond our control could impact our supply chain and customers negatively resulting in an adverse impact to our revenue and profitability.\nCertain of our components and other materials used in producing our products are from regions susceptible to natural disasters or other events beyond our control, such as the Covid-19 pandemic that was highly disruptive to businesses during the last few\nyears or the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. These and other events beyond our control can adversely impact our supply chains and our business. If we are unable to procure necessary materials, we could experience a disruption to our supply chain that would hinder our ability to produce our products in a timely manner. It also could cause us to seek other sources of supply which may be more costly or which we may not be able to procure on a timely basis. We also risk damage to any tooling, equipment or inventory at the suppliers facilities. For instance, flooding in October 2011 and a fire in November 2014 disrupted the operations at one of our contract manufacturers in Thailand. In addition, our customers may not follow their normal purchasing patterns or temporarily cease purchasing from us due to impacts to their businesses in the region, creating unexpected fluctuations or decreases in our revenue and profitability. Natural disasters, wars and other events beyond our control could have material adverse impacts on our business. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nNone. ITEM 2.

You are encouraged to reference Part II, Item 7, within that report, for a discussion of our financial condition and result of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2022.\nSAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995\nThis Form 10-K contains certain statements that are \"forward-looking statements\" as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on managements current expectations and assumptions. These statements often can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"assume,\" \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"estimate,\" \"target,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"project,\" \"should,\" or \"continue,\" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or similar terminology. Among other items, these statements relate to expectations of the business environment in which Digi operates, projections of future performance, perceived marketplace opportunities and statements regarding our mission and vision. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Among others, these include risks related to ongoing and varying inflationary and deflationary pressures around the world and the monetary policies of governments globally as well as present concerns about a potential recession and the ability of companies like us to operate a global business in such conditions as well as negative effects on product demand and the financial solvency of customers and suppliers in such conditions, risks related to ongoing supply chain challenges that continue to impact businesses globally, risks arising from the present war in Ukraine and the Middle East, the highly competitive market in which our company operates, rapid changes in technologies that may displace products sold by us, declining prices of networking products, our reliance on distributors and other third parties to sell our products, the potential for significant purchase orders to be canceled or changed, delays in product development efforts, uncertainty in user acceptance of our products, the ability to integrate our products and services with those of other parties in a commercially accepted manner, potential liabilities that can arise if any of our products have design or manufacturing defects, our ability to integrate and realize the expected benefits of acquisitions, our ability to defend or settle satisfactorily any litigation, the impact of natural disasters and other events beyond our control that could negatively impact our supply chain and customers, potential unintended consequences associated with restructuring, reorganizations or other similar business initiatives that may impact our ability to retain important employees or otherwise impact our operations in unintended and adverse ways, and changes in our level of revenue or profitability which can fluctuate for many reasons beyond our control.\nThese and other risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified from time to time in our filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation, those set forth in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, subsequent filings on Form 10-Q and other filings, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. Many of such factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date for which they are made. We disclaim any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a leading global provider of business and mission-critical IoT connectivity products, services and solutions. Our business is comprised of two reporting segments: IoT Products & Services and IoT Solutions.\nIn fiscal 2023, our key operating objectives included:\ncontinuing to transition to complete solutions with software and service offerings included with our products, as this drives ARR, which provides more predictable and higher margin revenues; and\ndelivering a higher level of services across our businesses.\nDuring fiscal 2023 we delivered on these objectives by increasing ARR by 12% from the end of fiscal 2022 to the end of fiscal 2023. This included an increase of 47% in our Products and Services business segment and 5% in our Solutions business segment. We also believe our high service levels are evidenced by an overall increase in revenues of 15% from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023.\nWe utilize many financial, operational, and other metrics to evaluate our financial condition and financial performance. Below we highlight the metrics for fiscal 2023 that we feel are most important in these evaluations, with comparisons to fiscal 2022:\nConsolidated revenue was $445 million, an increase of 15%.\nConsolidated gross profit was $252 million, an increase of 17%.\nGross profit margin was 56.7% versus 55.7%.\nNet income was $25 million, compared to $19 million, an increase of 28%.\nDiluted earnings per share was $0.67, compared to $0.54, an increase of 24%.\nAdjusted net income was $74 million, or $1.99 per diluted share, compared to $60 million, or $1.66 per diluted share, an increase of 20%.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $97 million, or 21.7% of revenue, compared to $79 million or 20.5% of revenue.\nARR was over $106 million at the end of the fiscal year, an increase of 12%.\nKey trends regarding our existing business\nThere are a number of circumstances globally that we are monitoring for potential impacts on our business. While the Covid-19 pandemic has ceased disrupting daily life, new variants of the virus continue to emerge. If any of these are considered dangerous, governments may react with a return to more restrictive policies. Global economic conditions and political tensions also have the ability to cause business disruptions. For instance, because of the war in Ukraine sanctions remain imposed on trade with Russia and Belarus which has the potential to disrupt the supply of raw materials needed to make components. Political tensions between China and western governments have become more heightened which could lead to similar disruptions. And the ongoing war in the Middle East could have a range of negative impacts for the global economy such as increases in the price of oil which could impact transportation costs. Central banks globally have increased interest rates significantly in an effort to combat inflation which has heightened concerns of recession in many regions of the world. These situations could all lead to potential adverse impacts on a wide range of businesses and could disrupt supply chains and impact the businesses of our vendors and customers in ways that could impact our sales.\nWith respect to supply chain, conditions did improve during fiscal 2023, but we still experience shortages of some important components. These supply chain shortages have led to component purchases at levels that were higher than historical trends to assure we could meet customer demand which drove higher levels of inventory. We increased our inventory write downs in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023. We expect the supply chain to continue to normalize in fiscal 2024 as we work through elevated inventory levels.\nIn addition, to the above macro conditions, we believe the following trends will continue to impact our business in fiscal 2024 and beyond:\nWe believe the market for Industrial IoT products and services is in the midst of a long-term expansion across a broad range of industries and solutions.\nAs recurring revenue from subscription and cloud monitoring services becomes a greater portion of our overall revenue, delivering at higher gross margins rates than one-time revenue, we expect gross margin rates to expand.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth selected information derived from our consolidated statements of operations, expressed as a percentage of revenue and as a percentage of change from year-to-year for the years indicated:\nYear ended September 30, % Increase (decrease)\n2023 2022 2023 compared to 2022\nRevenue 100.0 100.0 -\nCost of sales 43.3 44.3 (1.0)\nGross profit 56.7 55.7 1.0\nOperating expenses 45.4 45.9 (0.5)\nOperating income 11.3 9.8 1.5\nOther expense, net (5.7) (5.0) (0.7)\nIncome before income taxes 5.6 4.8 0.8\nIncome tax benefit - (0.2) 0.2\nNet income 5.6 % 5.0 % 0.6\nREVENUE BY SEGMENT\nYear ended September 30,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 % Increase (decrease)\nRevenue\nIoT Products & Services $ 345,680 77.7 % $ 297,645 76.7 % 16.1\nIoT Solutions 99,169 22.3 90,580 23.3 9.5\nTotal revenue $ 444,849 100.0 % $ 388,225 100.0 % 14.6\nIoT Products & Services\nIoT Products & Services revenue increased 16.1% for fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022. This primarily was the result of growth in the volume of sales in our OEM and Infrastructure Management product lines.\nIoT Solutions\nIoT Solutions revenue increased 9.5% for fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022. This was the result of growth in the volume of sales in both our SmartSense by Digi and Ventus offerings, as well as 2022 results excluding the results of Ventus prior to our November acquisition.\nARR\nARR was $106 million as of September 30, 2023, compared to $95 million as of September 30, 2022. IoT Products & Services ARR was $22 million as of September 30, 2023, compared to $15 million as of September 30, 2022. IoT Solutions ARR was $84 million as of September 30, 2023, compared to $80 million as of September 30, 2022. These increases in ARR in both business segments were driven by the expansion of business with existing customers who purchase on a subscription basis as well as sales to new customers. While it is possible to experience a loss of subscription based customer business due to contraction of a customers business or through competition, in general we believe if we provide a high level of service to our subscription based customers our level of ARR will continue to increase over time.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCOST OF GOODS SOLD AND GROSS PROFIT BY SEGMENT\nBelow are our segments' cost of goods sold and gross profit as a percentage of their respective total revenue:\nYear ended September 30, Basis point increase (decrease)\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022\nCost of Goods Sold\nIoT Products & Services $ 157,722 45.6 % $ 137,528 46.2 % (60)\nIoT Solutions 34,924 35.2 % 34,411 38.0 % (280)\nTotal cost of goods sold $ 192,646 43.3 % $ 171,939 44.3 % (100)\nYear ended September 30, Basis point increase (decrease)\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022\nGross Profit\nIoT Products & Services $ 187,958 54.4 % $ 160,117 53.8 % 60\nIoT Solutions 64,245 64.8 % 56,169 62.0 % 280\nTotal gross profit $ 252,203 56.7 % $ 216,286 55.7 % 100\nIoT Product & Services\nIoT Products & Services gross profit margin increased 60 basis points for fiscal 2023 as compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily the result of a reduction in the price of component purchases due to eased inflationary pressures partially offset by write-downs of inventory.\nIoT Solutions\nThe IoT Solutions gross profit margin increased 280 basis points for fiscal 2023 as compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily the result of growth in higher margin ARR subscription revenues.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nBelow are our operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue:\nYear ended September 30,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 $ increase (decrease) % Increase (decrease)\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing $ 81,681 18.3 % $ 70,366 18.1 % $ 11,315 16.1 %\nResearch and development 58,648 13.2 55,098 14.2 3,550 6.4\nGeneral and administrative 61,779 13.9 58,802 15.2 2,977 5.1\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration - - (6,200) (1.6) 6,200 N/M\nTotal operating expenses $ 202,108 45.4 % $ 178,066 45.9 % $ 24,042 13.5 %\nThe $24.0 million increase in operating expenses in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022 primarily was the result of no fair value changes of contingent consideration in 2023 compared to a $6.2 million gain in 2022, incremental investments in Opengear and SmartSense by Digi, an increase in stock-based compensation expense and an increase in costs associated with ongoing litigation.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOTHER EXPENSE, NET\nYear ended September 30,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 $ increase (decrease) % Increase (decrease)\nOther expense, net:\nInterest expense, net $ (25,236) (5.7) % $ (19,690) (5.1) % $ (5,546) 28.2 %\nOther expense, net 59 - 98 - (39) (39.8)\nTotal other expense, net $ (25,177) (5.7) % $ (19,592) (5.1) % $ (5,585) 28.5 %\nThe $5.6 million increase in other expense in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022 primarily was the result of an increase in our interest expense due to an increase in our effective interest rate (see Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements).\nINCOME TAXES\nOur effective income tax benefit rates were 0.6%, (4.1)% and (15.2)% for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our effective tax rate will vary based on a variety of factors. These include our overall profitability, the geographical mix of income before taxes and related statutory tax rate in each jurisdiction, and discrete events, such as settlement of audits (see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements).\nKEY BUSINESS METRICS\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue, or ARR, represents the annualized monthly value of all billable subscription contracts, measured at the end of any fiscal period. Subscriptions primarily include contracts for term-based equipment usage, the delivery of data insights, extended warranty coverage or customer service coverage. ARR excludes one-time items such as non-bundled hardware sales, professional services and wireless design services. Contracts with known, future expiration dates are included in ARR through their expiration date as long as collection is deemed likely. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to replace or forecast either item. Digi management uses ARR to manage and assess the growth of our subscription revenue business. Because ARR does not have a consistent definition, it is unlikely to be compared to the similarly titled measurements of other companies. We believe ARR is an indicator of the scale of our subscription revenue business and is less subject to seasonality and contract term changes than other metrics.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThis report includes adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"), each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure.\nNon-GAAP measures are not substitutes for GAAP measures for the purpose of analyzing financial performance. The disclosure of these measures does not reflect all charges and gains that actually were recognized by Digi. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or, an alternative for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies or presented by us in prior reports. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, the cash requirements for the replacement of depreciated and amortized assets, or changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs.\nWe believe that providing historical and adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, respectively, exclusive of such items as reversals of tax reserves, discrete tax benefits, restructuring charges and reversals, intangible amortization, stock-based compensation expense, other non-operating income/expense, adjustments to estimates of contingent consideration, acquisition-related expenses and interest expense related to acquisition permits investors to compare results with prior periods that did not include these items. Management uses the aforementioned non-GAAP measures to monitor and evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and to gain an understanding of our comparative operating performance. In addition, certain of our stockholders have expressed an interest in seeing financial performance measures exclusive of the impact of these matters, which while important, are not central to the core operations of our business. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring charges and reversals and changes in fair value of contingent consideration is useful to investors to evaluate our core operating results and financial performance because it excludes items that are significant non-cash or non-recurring expenses reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue is useful because it provides a reliable and consistent approach to measuring our performance from year to year and in assessing our performance against that of other companies. We believe this information helps compare operating results and corporate performance exclusive of the impact of our capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired.\nBelow are reconciliations from GAAP to Non-GAAP information that we feel is important to our business:\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA\n(In thousands)\nYear ended September 30,\n2023 2022\n% of total\nrevenue % of total\nrevenue\nTotal revenue $ 444,849 100.0 % $ 388,225 100.0 %\nNet income 24,770 5.6 % $ 19,383 5.0 %\nInterest expense, net 25,236 19,690\nIncome tax (benefit) 148 (755)\nDepreciation and amortization 31,979 33,839\nStock-based compensation expense 13,286 8,578\nChanges in fair value of contingent consideration - (6,200)\nRestructuring charge 141 275\nAcquisition and integration expense 940 4,605\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 96,500 21.7 % $ 79,415 20.5 %\nITEM 7.

In fiscal 2021 we issued an equity offering and in fiscal 2022 we issued debt to fund our acquisition of Ventus. Our liquidity requirements arise from our working capital needs, and to a lesser extent, our need to fund capital expenditures to support our current operations and facilitate growth and expansion.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we sold 4,025,000 shares of our common stock and received net proceeds of $73.8 million (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements).\nOur outstanding debt as of September 30, 2023 was issued under a third amended and restated credit agreement Digi entered with BMO on December 22, 2021. Digi refinanced the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Loan Facility under its existing credit agreement entered into on November 1, 2021, but did not receive any additional proceeds from nor modify the amounts of any facilities or subfacilities contained within that credit agreement. The credit agreement consists of a $350 million term loan B secured loan and a $35 million revolving credit facility. The $35 million revolving credit facility, which presently has no outstanding balance, includes a $10 million letter of credit subfacility and $10 million swingline subfacility. As of September 30, 2023, $35.0 million remained available under the Revolving Loan, which included $10 million available for a letter of credit subfacility and $10 million available under a swingline subfacility, the outstanding amounts of which decrease the available commitment. For additional information regarding the terms of our Credit Facility (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements).\nWe expect positive cash flows from operations. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents balances, cash generated from operations and our ability to borrow under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our business operations and capital expenditures for the next twelve months and beyond.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAs follows, our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 is summarized:\nYear ended September 30,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022\nOperating activities $ 36,751 $ 37,740\nInvesting activities (4,345) (349,528)\nFinancing activities (34,500) 192,782\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (1,113) 1,474\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,207) $ (117,532)\nCash flows from operating activities decreased $1.0 million primarily as a result of:\nan increase in net operating assets and liabilities (net of acquisitions) during fiscal 2023 of $19.1 million, compared to $18.4 million in fiscal 2022,\na decrease in amortization expense, and\nincreases in deferred income tax benefits (provisions) and provisions for bad debt.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\nno changes in the fair value of contingent consideration in fiscal 2023 compared to a decrease of $6.2 million in fiscal 2022, and\nincreases in stock compensation expense and net income.\nCash flows used in investing activities decreased $345.2 million primarily as a result of:\nno acquisitions occurring in fiscal 2023 compared to $347.5 million used for acquisitions in fiscal 2022, primarily related to our November 2021 acquisition of Ventus (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).\nThis increase was partially offset by:\nan increase in purchases of property, equipment, improvements and certain other intangible assets.\nCash flows from financing activities decreased $227.3 million primarily as a result of:\nno proceeds from loans in fiscal 2023 compared to $350.0 million in proceeds from the Term Loan issued in November 2021 in fiscal 2022, and\na reduction in proceeds from stock plan transactions.\nThis decrease was partially offset by:\npayments on debt of $36.4 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $148.1 million in fiscal 2022,\nno payments of debt issuance costs in fiscal 2023 compared to $13.4 million in fiscal 2022,\nan increase in ESPP proceeds, and\na decrease in taxes paid for net share settlements.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations at September 30, 2023:\nPayments due by fiscal period\n($ in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years Thereafter\nOperating leases $ 20,276 $ 3,999 $ 6,634 $ 3,938 $ 5,705\nRevolving loan 213,625 17,500 35,000 35,000 126,125\nInterest on long-term debt 90,492 21,978 37,442 29,977 1,095\nTotal $ 324,393 $ 43,477 $ 79,076 $ 68,915 $ 132,925\nThe operating lease agreements included above primarily relate to office space. The table above does not include our possible payments for uncertain tax positions. Our reserve for uncertain tax positions, including accrued interest and penalties, was $3.2 million as of September 30, 2023. Due to the nature of the underlying liabilities and the extended time often needed to resolve income tax uncertainties, we cannot make reliable estimates of the amount or timing of future cash payments that may be required to settle these liabilities. The above table also does not include those obligations for royalties under license agreements as these royalties are calculated based on future sales of licensed products and we cannot make reliable estimates of the amount of cash payments.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY\nWe are not exposed to a significant amount of foreign currency transaction risk associated with sales transactions as the majority of our sales are denominated in U.S. Dollars. We are exposed to foreign currency translation risk as the financial position and operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidation. We manage our net asset or net liability position for non-functional currency accounts, primarily the U.S. Dollar accounts in our foreign locations to reduce our foreign currency risk. We have not implemented a formal hedging strategy.\nDuring 2023, 2022 and 2021, we had approximately $121.1 million, $85.8 million and $80.7 million, respectively, of revenue related to foreign customers including export sales, of which $0.8 million were denominated in foreign currencies, predominantly the Canadian Dollar. In future periods, we continue to expect that the majority of our sales will be in U.S. Dollar.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the values of purchased assets and assumed liabilities in acquisitions. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies impact our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nWe recognize hardware product revenue upon transfer of control of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We determine the amount of revenue to be recognized through application of the following steps:\nidentification of the contract, or contracts with a customer;\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\ndetermination of the transaction price;\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\nrecognition of revenue when or as we satisfy the performance obligations.\nHardware Product Revenue and SmartSense by Digi Equipment Revenue and Associated Installation Fees\nOur hardware product revenue is derived primarily from the sale of wired and wireless hardware products to our distributors and direct/original equipment manufacturer (Direct/OEM) customers. Product revenue generally is recognized upon shipment of the product to a customer. Sales to authorized domestic distributors and Direct/OEM customers typically are made with certain rights of return and price adjustment provisions. Estimated reserves for future credit returns and pricing adjustments are established based on an analysis of historical patterns of credit returns and price adjustments compared to received credit returns and distribution sales for the current period. Estimated reserves for future credit returns and price adjustments are charged against revenue in the same period as the corresponding sales are recorded. Estimated sales returns for our distributor stock rotation program are accounted for under the guidance of ASC 845 Nonmonetary Transactions. Material differences between the historical trends used to determine estimated reserves and actual credit returns and pricing adjustments could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position.\nEquipment revenue from SmartSense by Digi within our IoT Solutions segment is recognized upon shipment of the equipment to a customer. Installation service charges from these sales are recorded when the product is installed.\nSubscription and Support Services Revenue\nOur SmartSense by Digi\u00ae and Ventus subscription revenue is based on contracts with at least an annual term and is recorded on a monthly basis. These subscriptions are generally in a range from one to five years, and may contain an evergreen renewal provision. Generally, our subscription renewal charges per month are the same as the original contract term.\nWe also derive service revenue from our Digi Remote Manager, a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering, whereby customers pay for services consumed based on the number of devices being managed or monitored. This revenue is recognized over the life of the service term and is included in our IoT Products & Services segment.\nDigi Support Services revenues are recognized over the life of the support contract and included in our IoT Products & Services segment. Some of Digi Support Services revenue is one-time in nature for training and this revenue is recognized as the services are performed.\nProfessional Services Revenue\nProfessional services revenue is derived from our Digi Wireless Design Services contracts on either on a time-and-materials or a fixed-fee basis. These revenues are one-time in nature, are included in our IoT Products & Services segment and are recognized as the services are performed for time-and-materials contracts or as invoiced for fixed-fee contracts.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nFrom time to time we have contracts from customers with multiple performance obligations. Our hardware products may be combined with our Digi Remote Manager PaaS offering as well as other support services in an individual contract. Our SmartSense by Digi revenues typically are derived from contracts with multiple performance obligations. These obligations may include: delivery of monitoring equipment that the customer purchases out-right, monitoring services, providing condition alerts of assets being monitored, and recertification of sensor equipment. When we retain ownership of the equipment, we charge an implementation fee to the customer so they can begin using the equipment. In these instances, all revenue derived from the above obligations is recognized over the subscription term of the contract. If the customer purchases the equipment out-right, that portion of the revenue is recognized at the stand-alone selling price at the time the equipment is shipped and all\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nother revenue is recognized over the subscription term of the contract. We have made an accounting policy election to exclude from the measurement of our revenues any sales or similar taxes we collect from customers.\nINVENTORIES\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined using the first-in, first-out method. We reduce the carrying value of our inventories for estimated excess and obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future product demand and market conditions. These estimates are subject to uncertainty and involve the use of historical data and future market expectations. Once the new cost basis is established, the value is not increased with any changes in circumstances that would indicate an increase in value after the re-measurement. If actual product demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required that could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position.\nGOODWILL\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of June 30, or more frequently if events or circumstances occur which could indicate impairment. For our quantitative goodwill impairment tests, we determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value, an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess. We have two reportable segments, our IoT Products & Services segment and our IoT Solutions segment (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Effective with the reorganization announcement on October 7, 2020 (see Note 10), our IoT Products & Services business is structured to include four reporting units under the IoT Products & Services segment, each with a reporting manager: Cellular Routers, Console Servers, OEM Solutions and Infrastructure Management. Following our acquisition of Ventus in the first fiscal quarter of 2022, IoT Solutions is comprised of two reporting units; Ventus and SmartSense by Digi. Each of our six reporting units have been tested individually for impairment.\nThe fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a weighted combination of an income and market approach. A discounted cash flow (DCF) method is utilized for the income approach. In developing the DCF analysis, our assumptions about future revenues, expenses, capital expenditures, and changes in working capital are based on managements projections, and assume a terminal growth rate thereafter. A separate discount rate is determined for each reporting unit and these cash flows are then discounted to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The market approach determines a value derived from the guideline company method. This market approach method estimates the price reasonably expected to be realized from the sale of the reporting unit based on comparable companies.\nAssumptions and estimates to determine fair values under the income and market approaches are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors. These include external factors such as industry and economic trends. They also include internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. We believe we made a reasonable estimate with the assumptions used to calculate the fair values of our two reporting segments. Changes in circumstances or a potential event could negatively affect the estimated fair values. We will continue to monitor potential impacts to our assumptions, as any changes could potentially affect our cash flows and market capitalization. If our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units, we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill.\nDigi conducted an analysis as of September 30, 2023 and concluded changes in market conditions from the time of the fiscal 2023 test, conducted as of June 30,2023, were not indicative of a reduction in fair value of any of our reporting units.\nResults of our Fiscal 2023 Annual Impairment Test\nAs of June 30, 2023, we had a total of $32.7 million of goodwill for the Cellular Routers reporting unit, $57.1 million of goodwill for the Console Servers reporting unit, $64.6 million of goodwill for the OEM Solutions reporting unit, $20.4 million of goodwill for the Infrastructure Management reporting unit, $48.9 million of goodwill for the SmartSense by Digi reporting unit and $118.6 million of goodwill for the Ventus reporting unit. At June 30, 2023, the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value for all six reporting units and no impairment was recorded. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nWe may be exposed to interest rate risk should we decide to invest in marketable securities. When we held marketable securities, we classified them as available-for-sale and they were carried at fair value. Our investments historically consisted of money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds and government municipal bonds. Our investment policy specifies the types of eligible investments and minimum credit quality of our investments, as well as diversification and concentration limits which mitigate our risk. We do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge against interest rate risk because the majority of our investments mature in less than one year.\nWe are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2023, we had $213.6 million outstanding under our Term Loan and $0.0 million outstanding under our Revolving Loan. Following an amendment in December 2021, borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bore interest at a rate based on LIBOR until the discontinuation of LIBOR on June 30, 2023. Following this date, borrowings under the Term Loan Facility are subject to a rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") with a credit spread adjustment to adjust for the change in reference rate ranging from 0.10% to 0.40%, depending on Digi's interest election. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility are subject to a rate based on SOFR, with a floor of 0.50% for an interest period of one, three or six months as selected by Digi, reset at the end of the selected interest period plus 5.00% or a base rate plus 4.00%. The base rate is determined by reference to the highest of BMOs prime rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, or the one-month SOFR for U.S. dollars plus 1.00%. The applicable margin for loans under the Revolving Credit Facility is in a range of 4.00% to 3.75% for SOFR loans and 3.00% to 2.75% for base rate loans, depending on Digis consolidated leverage ratio. Based on the balance sheet position for both the Term Loan and Revolving Loan at September 30, 2023, the annualized effect of a 25 basis point change in interest rates would increase or decrease our interest expense by $0.5 million. For additional information, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. For our Credit Facility, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair value of the debt instruments, but do impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. If interest rates remain elevated, we will continue to see interest expenses that are higher than historical amounts.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RISK\nWe are exposed to foreign currency transaction risk associated with certain sales being denominated in Canadian Dollars and in certain cases, transactions in U.S. Dollars in our foreign entities. We are also exposed to foreign currency translation risk as the financial position and operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidation. We manage our net asset or net liability position for non-functional currency accounts, primarily the U.S. dollar accounts in our foreign locations to reduce our foreign currency risk. In addition, as foreign currency rates fluctuate, we may from time to time, adjust the prices of our products, services and subscriptions. We have not implemented a formal hedging strategy.\nThe table below compares the average monthly exchange rates of the Euro, British Pound Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar:\nFiscal year ended\nSeptember 30, % increase\n2023 2022 (decrease)\nEuro 1.0679 1.1057 (3.4) %\nBritish Pound 1.2183 1.1377 7.1 %\nCanadian Dollar 0.7380 0.7768 (5.0) %\nAustralian Dollar 0.6423 0.7105 (9.6) %\nA 10.0% change from the 2023 average exchange rate for the Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar to the U.S. Dollar would have resulted in an immaterial increase or decrease in fiscal 2023 annual revenue and a 1.0% increase or decrease in stockholders' equity at September 30, 2023. The above analysis does not take into consideration any pricing adjustments we may make in response to changes in the exchange rates.\nCREDIT RISK\nWe have some exposure to credit risk related to our accounts receivable portfolio. Exposure to credit risk is controlled through regular monitoring of customer financial status, credit limits and collaboration with sales management on customer contacts to facilitate payment.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 22, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nGoodwill - Cellular Routers, Smart Sense, and Ventus Reporting Units - Refer to Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements\nThe Companys evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company used a combination of the income approach and market approach to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, specifically related to the determination of discount rates and forecasts of future gross margins and earnings before income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margins used in the income approach. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value. The goodwill balance was $342.3 million as of June 30, 2023, of which $32.7 million, $48.9 million, and $118.6 million was allocated to the Cellular Routers, Smart Sense, and Ventus reporting units, respectively.\nWe identified goodwill for the Cellular Routers, Smart Sense, and Ventus reporting units as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of these reporting units, specifically related to the determination of discount rates and forecasts of future gross margins and EBITDA margins. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing\naudit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of managements estimates and assumptions related to selection of the discount rates and future assumptions of gross margins and EBITDA margins.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the discount rates and forecasts of future gross margins and EBITDA margins used by management to estimate the fair value of the Cellular Routers, Smart Sense and Ventus reporting units included the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over managements goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value of the Cellular Routers, Smart Sense, and Ventus reporting units, such as controls related to managements selection of the discount rates and forecasts of future gross margins and EBITDA margins.\nWe evaluated managements ability to accurately forecast future gross margins and EBITDA margins by comparing actual results to managements historical forecasts.\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of managements gross margin and EBITDA margin forecasts by comparing the forecasts to:\n\u25e6Historical gross margins and EBITDA margins.\n\u25e6Forecasted information included in Company press releases as well as in industry reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies.\nWith the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology and (2) discount rates by:\n\u25e6Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rates and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.\n\u25e6Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nNovember 22, 2023\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2022.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Shareholders\nDigi International Inc.\nOpinion on the financial statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Digi International Inc.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBusiness Description\nWe are a leading global provider of business and mission-critical IoT connectivity products, services and solutions. We help our customers create next-generation connected products to deploy, monitor and manage critical communications infrastructures and compliance standards in demanding environments with high levels of security and reliability. We have two reportable segments: (i) IoT Products & Services; and (ii) IoT Solutions.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year's consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.\nAccounting Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of money market accounts and other highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these investments. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents in bank accounts which may exceed federally insured limits at times. We have not experienced any losses in these accounts.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are stated at the amount we expect to collect. This amount is net of an allowance for credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and a reserve for future credit returns and pricing adjustments. The following factors are considered when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, and changes in customer payment terms or practices. In addition, overall historical collection experience, current economic industry trends, and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable are considered when determining the required allowance for credit losses. Based on our assessment, we provide for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to our allowance for credit losses. Balances that remain outstanding after we have used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the allowance for credit losses and a credit to accounts receivable. Estimated reserves for future credit returns and pricing adjustments are established based on an analysis of historical patterns of credit returns and price adjustments compared to received credit returns and distribution sales for the current period. Estimated reserves for future credit returns and price adjustments are charged against revenue in the same period as the corresponding sales are recorded. Estimated sales returns for our distributor stock rotation program are accounted for under the guidance of Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") 845 Nonmonetary Transactions.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the allowance for credit losses (in thousands):\nYear ended September 30,\n2023 2022\nBalance at beginning of period $ 3,285 $ 3,934\nAdditions 1,134 1,475\nUncollectible accounts charged to allowance, net of recoveries (2,726) (2,124)\nBalance at end of period $ 1,693 $ 3,285\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method. Appropriate consideration is given to deterioration, obsolescence and other factors in evaluating net realizable value.\nProperty, Equipment and Improvements, Net\nProperty, equipment and improvements are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided by charges to operations using the straight-line method over the estimated asset useful lives. Furniture and fixtures, purchased software and other equipment are depreciated over a period of three years to ten years. Building improvements and buildings are depreciated over ten years and 39 years, respectively. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Long-lived assets to be held and used, such as property, equipment and improvements, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred, while major renewals and betterments are capitalized. The assets and related accumulated depreciation accounts are adjusted for asset retirements and disposals with the resulting gain or loss included in operations.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets\nPurchased proven technology, license agreements, covenants not to compete and other identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value when acquired in a business acquisition, or at cost when not purchased in a business acquisition. All other identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of three years to 20.5 years. Useful lives for identifiable intangible assets are estimated at the time of acquisition based on the periods of time from which we expect to derive benefits from the identifiable intangible assets. Amortization of purchased and core technology is included in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amortization of all other acquired identifiable intangible assets is charged to operating expenses as a component of general and administrative expense.\nIdentifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that undiscounted expected future cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value amount. Impairment losses, if any, are recorded in the period the impairment is identified. There were no impairments identified in fiscal 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is quantitatively tested for impairment on an annual basis as of June 30, or more frequently if events or circumstances occur which could indicate impairment.\nWe have two reportable segments: our IoT Products & Services segment and our IoT Solutions segment (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Effective with the reorganization announcement on October 7, 2020 (see Note 10), our IoT Products & Services business is structured to include four reporting units under the IoT Products & Services segment, each with a reporting manager: Cellular Routers, Console Servers, OEM Solutions and Infrastructure Management. Following our acquisition of Ventus in the first fiscal quarter of 2022, IoT Solutions is comprised of two reporting units: Ventus and SmartSense by Digi. We have six reporting units that have been tested individually for impairment.\nDue to the reorganization on October 7, 2020 (see Note 10), we performed an interim impairment test in addition to our annual test as of June 30, 2021. Our goodwill impairment tests as of June 30, 2023, June 30,2022, June 30, 2021 and October 7, 2020 indicated no impairment (see Note 3). During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we assessed various qualitative factors to determine whether or not an additional goodwill impairment assessment was required as of September 30, 2023, and we concluded that no additional impairment assessment was required.\nContingent Consideration\nWe measure our contingent consideration liabilities recognized in connection with business combinations at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820 \"Fair Value Measurement.\" We used a probability-weighted discounted cash flow approach as a valuation technique to\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\ndetermine the fair value of the contingent consideration on the acquisition date. At each subsequent reporting period, the fair value is re-measured with the change in fair value recognized in general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amounts, if any, paid to the seller in excess of the amount recorded on the acquisition date will be classified as cash flows used in operating activities. Payments to the seller not exceeding the acquisition-date fair value of the contingent consideration will be classified as cash flows used in financing activities.\nWarranties\nIn general, we warrant our hardware products to be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service. The warranty periods generally range from one year to five years. We typically have the option to either repair or replace hardware products we deem defective with regard to material or workmanship. Estimated warranty costs are accrued in the period that the related revenue is recognized based upon an estimated average per unit repair or replacement cost applied to the estimated number of units under warranty. These estimates are based upon historical warranty incidents and are evaluated on an ongoing basis to ensure the adequacy of the warranty accrual.\nWe also warrant our software or firmware incorporated into our products generally for a period of one year and offer to provide a bug fix or software patch within a reasonable period. We have not accrued specifically for this warranty and have not had claims specifically related to software or firmware. We are not responsible for, and do not warrant that, custom software versions, created by OEM customers based upon our software source code, will function in a particular way, will conform to any specifications or are fit for any particular purpose. Further, we do not indemnify these customers from any third-party liability as it relates to or arises from any customization or modifications made by the OEM customer.\nTreasury Stock\nWe record treasury stock at cost. Treasury stock may be acquired from employees for tax withholding purposes related to vesting of restricted stock unit awards as part of our stock-based compensation program and issued pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize hardware product revenue upon transfer of control of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nWe determine the amount of revenue to be recognized through application of the following steps:\nidentification of the contract, or contracts with a customer;\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\ndetermination of the transaction price;\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\nrecognition of revenue when or as we satisfy the performance obligations.\nHardware Product Revenue and SmartSense by Digi Equipment Revenue and Associated Installation Fees\nOur hardware product revenue is derived primarily from the sale of wired and wireless hardware products to our distributors and OEM customers. Product revenue generally is recognized upon shipment of the product to a customer. Sales to authorized domestic distributors and OEM customers typically are made with certain rights of return and price adjustment provisions. Estimated reserves for future credit returns and pricing adjustments are established based on an analysis of historical patterns of credit returns and price adjustments compared to received credit returns and distribution sales for the current period. Estimated reserves for future credit returns and price adjustments are charged against revenue in the same period as the corresponding sales are recorded. Material differences between the historical trends used to determine estimated reserves and actual credit returns and pricing adjustments could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Estimated sales returns for our distributor stock rotation program are accounted for under the guidance of ASC 845 Nonmonetary Transactions.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nEquipment revenue from SmartSense by Digi and Ventus within our IoT Solutions segment is recognized upon shipment of the equipment to a customer. Installation service charges from these sales are recorded when the product is installed.\nSubscription and Support Services Revenue\nOur SmartSense by Digi and Ventus subscription revenue is recorded on a monthly basis. These subscriptions are generally in a range from one year to five years, and may contain an evergreen renewal provision. Generally, our subscription renewal charges per month are the same as the original contract term.\nWe derive service revenue from our Digi Remote Manager, a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering, whereby customers pay for services consumed based on the number of devices being managed or monitored. This revenue is recognized over the life of the service term and is included in our IoT Products & Services segment.\nDigi Support Services revenues are recognized over the life of the support contract and included in our IoT Products & Services segment. Some of Digi Support Services revenue is for training and this revenue is recognized as the services are performed.\nProfessional Services Revenue\nProfessional services revenue is derived from our Digi Wireless Design Services contracts on either on a time-and-materials or a fixed-fee basis. These revenues, which are included in our IoT Products & Services segment are recognized as the services are performed for time-and-materials contracts or as invoiced for fixed-fee contracts.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nFrom time to time we have contracts from customers with multiple performance obligations. Our hardware products may be combined with our Digi Remote Manager PaaS offering as well as other support services in an individual contract. Our SmartSense by Digi\u00ae revenues typically are derived from contracts with multiple performance obligations. These obligations may include: delivery of monitoring equipment that the customer purchases out-right, monitoring services, providing condition alerts of assets being monitored, and recertification of sensor equipment. When we retain ownership of the equipment, we charge an implementation fee to the customer so they can begin using the equipment. In these instances, all revenue derived from the above obligations is recognized over the subscription term of the contract. If the customer purchases the equipment out-right, that portion of the revenue is recognized at the stand-alone selling price at the time the equipment is shipped and all other revenue is recognized over the subscription term of the contract. We have made an accounting policy election to exclude from the measurement of our revenues any sales or similar taxes we collect from customers.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed when incurred. Research and development costs include compensation, allocation of corporate costs, depreciation, utilities, professional services and prototypes. Software and firmware development costs are expensed as incurred until the point that both the technological feasibility and the proven marketability of the product are established. To date, the time period between the establishment of technological feasibility and completion of software development has been short and no significant development costs have been incurred during that period. Accordingly, we have not capitalized any software development costs to date.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Income tax expense is equal to the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as changes in income tax reserves. We maintain valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in our tax provision in the period of change. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense represents the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. This cost must be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide the service (usually the vesting period).\nForeign Currency Translation\nFinancial position and results of operations of our international subsidiaries are measured using local currencies as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. For our international subsidiaries, our statements of operations accounts are translated at the weighted average rates of exchange prevailing during each reporting period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing currency exchange rates from period to period are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity. Gains and losses on foreign currency exchange transactions, as well as translation gains or losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than an entitys functional currency, are reflected in the statement of operations. During fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 there were net transaction gains (losses) of $0.0 million, $0.1 million and $(0.1) million, respectively that were recorded in other income, net. We manage our net asset or net liability position for U.S. dollar accounts in our foreign locations to reduce our foreign currency risk. We have not implemented a formal hedging strategy.\nComprehensive Income\nOur comprehensive income is comprised of net income, foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. These items are charged or credited to the accumulated other comprehensive loss account in stockholders equity.\nNet Income Per Common Share\nBasic net income per common share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares of our stock result from common stock options and restricted stock units. We use the treasury stock method to calculate the weighted-average shares used in the diluted earnings per share computation. Under this method the proceeds from exercise of an option, any amount of compensation cost for future service that we have not yet recognized, and the amount of estimated tax benefits that would be recorded in paid-in capital when the option is exercised are assumed to have been used to repurchase shares in the current period.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators in the net income per common share calculations (in thousands, except per common share data):\nYear ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 24,770 $ 19,383 $ 10,366\nDenominator:\nDenominator basic net income per common share - weighted average shares outstanding 35,820 35,031 32,111\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nStock options and restricted stock units 1,049 964 1,283\nDenominator diluted net income per common share - adjusted weighted average shares 36,869 35,995 33,394\nNet income per common share, basic $ 0.69 $ 0.55 $ 0.32\nNet income per common share, diluted $ 0.67 $ 0.54 $ 0.31\nBecause their effect would be anti-dilutive at period end, certain potentially dilutive shares related to stock options to purchase common shares were excluded in the above computation of diluted earnings per share because the options exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common shares. For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, such excluded stock options were 395,190, 647,181 and 1,122,121, respectively.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. ACQUISITIONS\nFiscal 2022 Acquisition\nAcquisition of Ventus\nOn November 1, 2021, we acquired Ventus for approximately $350 million in cash. The acquisition was funded through a combination of cash on hand and debt financing under a $350 million credit facility committed by BMO Harris Bank N.A.\nFor tax purposes, this acquisition was treated as an asset acquisition. We believe this is a complementary acquisition for us as it significantly enhances our IoT Solutions segment by enhancing Digi's service portfolio and immediately extends the company's market reach with a Managed Network-as-a-Service (\"MNaaS\") solutions offering.\nCosts directly related to the acquisition of $4.4 million incurred in fiscal 2022 were charged to operations and are included in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations. These acquisition costs include legal, accounting, valuation and investment banking fees.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of Ventus assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date (in thousands):\nCash $ 350,000\nFair value of net tangible assets acquired $ 20,365\nIdentifiable intangible assets:\nCustomer relationships 179,000\nPurchased and core technology 16,000\nTrademarks 16,000\nGoodwill 118,635\nTotal $ 350,000\nThe consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2022 reflects the final allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The fair value of customer relationships was calculated using the excess earnings method, while purchased and core technology and patents were valued using the relief from royalty method. These methodologies utilize future estimates including revenues attributable to customer relationships, tax rates, discount rates, royalty rates and obsolescence rates. The final purchase price allocation includes an adjustment made in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022 to reflect an update from our preliminary purchase price allocation to the valuation of the net tangible assets acquired and goodwill resulting from the acquisition. Included in the fair value of net tangible assets acquired was $0.9 million of right-of-use asset included in other non-current assets and $0.9 million of lease liability included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities associated with Ventus operating leases.\nThe weighted average useful life for all the identifiable intangibles listed above is estimated to be 19.2 years. For purposes of determining fair value, the existing customer relationships identified above are assumed to have a useful life of 20.5 years, purchased and core technology is assumed to have useful life of 11 years and trademarks are assumed a useful life of 13 years. Useful lives for identifiable intangible assets are estimated at the time of acquisition based on the periods of time from which we expect to derive benefits from the identifiable intangible assets. The identifiable intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method which reflects the pattern in which the assets are expected to be consumed.\nThe fiscal 2022 consolidated results include $54.3 million in revenue contributed by the acquired Ventus business. It is impracticable to quantify the amount of Ventus contribution to our consolidated net income due to the business structure management uses for reporting and allocating expenses to segments.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. ACQUISITIONS (CONTINUED)\nThe following consolidated pro forma information is presented as if the acquisition had occurred on October 1, 2020 (in thousands):\nYear ended September 30,\n2022 2021\nNet sales $ 393,290 $ 360,820\nNet income (loss) $ 14,274 $ (2,701)\nPro forma net income has been adjusted to include interest expense related to debt incurred as a result of the acquisition, amortization on the fair value of the intangibles acquired and remove any costs incurred with the sale transaction. Net income for the year ended September 30, 2021 was adjusted to include acquisition-related costs of $3.1 million.\nFiscal 2021 Acquisitions\nAcquisition of Haxiot\nOn March 26, 2021, we acquired Haxiot, a Dallas-based provider of low power wide area (\"LPWA\") wireless technology. Following this date, the results of operations are included within our IoT Products & Services segment. We believe this is a complementary acquisition for us as it significantly enhances our IoT Products & Services segment by enhancing Digi's embedded systems portfolio and immediately extends the company's market reach with a complete LoRaWAN-based solutions offering.\nThe terms of the acquisition included an upfront cash payment as well as contingent consideration comprised of future earn-out payments. We funded the closing of the acquisition with $7.1 million of cash on hand. The future earn-out payments are based on Haxiot revenue performance and contractually are not to exceed $3.0 million and $5.0 million for the annual periods ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022. In the third quarter of fiscal 2021, the purchase price allocation was updated, including related determination of fair value and income tax implications. As a result, we adjusted goodwill to $8.6 million and adjusted contingent consideration to $5.9 million. In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022, it was determined that the revenue thresholds would not be met and the remaining balance was adjusted down by $5.9 million, resulting in a fair value of $0.0 million for contingent consideration relating to the acquisition of Haxiot at September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nFor tax purposes, this acquisition is treated as a stock acquisition. The goodwill therefore is not deductible.\nCosts directly related to the acquisition of $0.3 million have been charged to operations in fiscal 2021. These costs are included in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations. These acquisition costs include legal, accounting, valuation and investment banking fees.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of Haxiot assets acquired, net of $50 thousand of cash acquired, and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date (in thousands).\nCash $ 7,096\nContingent consideration 5,900\nTotal $ 12,996\nFair value of net tangible assets acquired $ 86\nIdentifiable intangible assets:\nCustomer relationships 3,900\nPurchased and core technology 1,050\nTrademarks 500\nDeferred tax liability on identifiable intangible assets (1,145)\nGoodwill 8,605\nTotal $ 12,996\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. ACQUISITIONS (CONTINUED)\nAcquisition of Ctek, Inc.\nOn July 6, 2021, we acquired Ctek, Inc. (\"Ctek\"), a San Pedro, California-based provider that specializes in solutions for remote monitoring and industrial controls. The results of operations of Ctek are included in our fourth quarter fiscal 2021 results within our IoT Products & Services segment. Through the acquisition of Ctek, Digi is uniquely positioned to provide customers with both battery and hardwired options for the control and monitoring of critical infrastructure, from complex off-shore oil rig locations to localized deployments such as municipal park lighting. In addition, Cteks offering and existing client portfolio is set to further Digis reach in a rapidly expanding market.\nThe terms of the acquisition included an upfront cash payment as well as contingent consideration comprised of future earn-out payments. We funded the closing of the acquisition with $12.0 million of cash on hand. The future earn-out payments are based on revenue performance outlined in the terms of the purchase agreement for the annual periods ending December 31, 2021, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. The cumulative amount of these earn-outs for the annual periods had a max $0.5 million, $1.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, it was determined that the revenue thresholds would not be met and the remaining balance was adjusted down by $0.3 million, resulting in a fair value of $0.0 million for contingent consideration relating to the acquisition of Ctek at September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nFor tax purposes, this acquisition is treated as a stock acquisition. The goodwill therefore is not deductible.\nCosts directly related to the acquisition of $0.3 million have been charged to operations in fiscal 2021. These costs are included in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations. These acquisition costs include legal, accounting, valuation and investment banking fees.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of Ctek assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date (in thousands).\nCash $ 12,012\nContingent consideration 300\nWorking capital adjustment 422\nTotal $ 12,734\nFair value of net tangible assets acquired $ 397\nIdentifiable intangible assets:\nCustomer relationships 5,100\nPurchased and core technology 1,300\nTrademarks 70\nBacklog 1,000\nGoodwill 4,867\nTotal $ 12,734\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n3.

GOODWILL AND OTHER IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET (CONTINUED)\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is quantitatively tested for impairment on an annual basis as of June 30, or more frequently if events or circumstances occur which could indicate impairment. We continue to have two reportable segments, our IoT Products & Services segment and our IoT Solutions segment (see Note 4). Effective with the reorganization announcement on October 7, 2020 (see Note 10), our IoT Products & Services business is structured to include four reporting units under the IoT Products & Services segment, each with a reporting manager: Cellular Routers, Console Servers, OEM Solutions and Infrastructure Management. Due to the reorganization, we performed our fiscal third quarter 2021 annual impairment test for those four reporting units along with our IoT Solutions segment. Following our acquisition of Ventus, IoT Solutions is comprised of two reporting units. All six reporting units were included in our fiscal third quarter 2022 annual impairment test.\nFor our quantitative goodwill impairment tests, we determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value, then an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess. Fair values for the six reporting units were each estimated on a standalone basis using a weighted combination of the income approach and market approach.\nThe income approach indicates the fair value of a business based on the value of the cash flows the business or asset can be expected to generate in the future. A commonly used variation of the income approach used to value a business is the discounted cash flow (DCF) method. The DCF method is a valuation technique in which the value of a business is estimated on the earnings capacity, or available cash flow, of that business. Earnings capacity represents the earnings available for distribution to stockholders after consideration of the reinvestment required for future growth. Significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows for each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. Key assumptions used in the analysis were related to the determination of discount rates and forecasts of future gross margins and earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization margins. The market approach indicates the fair value of a business or asset based on a comparison of the business or asset to comparable publicly traded companies or assets and transactions in its industry as well as our prior acquisitions. This approach can be estimated through the guideline company method. This method indicates fair value of a business by comparing it to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. After identifying and selecting the guideline companies, we make judgments about the comparability of the companies based on size, growth rates, profitability, risk, and return on investment in order to estimate market multiples. These multiples are then applied to the reporting units to estimate a fair value.\nAssumptions and estimates to determine fair values under the income and market approaches are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors. These include external factors such as industry and economic trends. They also include internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Changes in circumstances or a potential event could negatively affect the estimated fair values. We will continue to monitor potential impacts to our assumptions, as any changes could potentially affect our cash flows and market capitalization. If our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units, we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill.\nDigi conducted an analysis as of September 30, 2023 and concluded changes in market conditions from the time of the Fiscal 2023 test, conducted as of June 30,2023, were not indicative of a reduction in fair value of any of our reporting units.\nResults of our Fiscal 2023 Annual Impairment Test\nAs of June 30, 2023, we had a total of $32.7 million of goodwill for the Cellular Routers reporting unit, $57.1 million of goodwill for the Console Servers reporting unit, $64.6 million of goodwill for the OEM Solutions reporting unit, $20.4 million of goodwill for the Infrastructure Management reporting unit, $48.9 million of goodwill for the SmartSense by Digi reporting unit and $118.6 million of goodwill for the Ventus reporting unit. At June 30, 2023, the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value for all six reporting units and no impairment was recorded.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n4. SEGMENT INFORMATION AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS\nWe have two reportable segments: (i) IoT Products & Services and (ii) IoT Solutions. This determination was made by considering both qualitative and quantitative information. The qualitative information included, but was not limited to, the following: the nature of the products and services and customers differ between the two segments, discrete financial information is available through operating income for both segments and the Chief Operating Decision Maker is reviewing both segments financial information separately to make decisions about the allocation of resources. Effective with the reorganization announcement on October 7, 2020 (see Note 10), our IoT Products & Services business is structured to include four operating segments, each with a segment manager. Following our acquisition of Ventus in the first fiscal quarter of 2022, IoT Solutions is comprised of two reporting units; Ventus and SmartSense by Digi.\nIoT Products & Services\nOur IoT Products & Services segment is composed of the following four operating segments:\nCellular Routers - box devices (fully enclosed) that provide connectivity typically in a place where the device can be plugged in exclusively using cellular communications.\nConsole Servers - similar to cellular routers except they are exclusively for edge computing installations and data center applications exclusively using cellular communications.\nOEM Solutions - Original Equipment Manufacturers (\"OEM\") will be a chip, rather than a boxed device. This can come in the form of a stand-alone chip, or from a systems-on-module (\"SOMs\"). While cellular connectivity is used, other communication protocols can be used such as Zigbee, Bluetooth or Radio-Frequency (\"RF\") based on application.\nInfrastructure Management - includes battery operated, cellular enabled connect sensors as well as other types of console server applications that are more Digi Accelerated Linux (\"DAL\") based than Console Servers. This operating segment has some products that do not use cellular communications, but a large part of this segment does use cellular communications.\nIoT Solutions\nFollowing the acquisition of Ventus on November 1, 2021, IoT Solutions is comprised of two operating segments:\nSmartSense by Digi - offers wireless temperature and other condition-based monitoring services for perishable goods such as food or medicine, as well as employee task management services.\nVentus - provides MNaaS solutions that simplify the complexity of enterprise wide area network (\"WAN\") connectivity via wireless and fixed line solutions.\nThe operating segments included in each reportable segment have similar qualitative and quantitative factors, which allow us to aggregate them under each reportable segment. The qualitative factors include similar nature of products and services, production process, type or class of customers and methods used to distribute the products. The quantitative factors include similar operating margins. Our chief operating decision maker reviews and makes business decisions which includes a primary review of operating income but also includes gross profit. Following the October 2020 reorganization, the shared general and administrative costs are being allocated to each operating segment. As a result, our disclosed measure of segment operating income has been updated for all periods presented to conform with this change.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n4.

No single customer exceeded 10% of revenue or accounts receivable for any of the periods presented.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n5. SELECTED BALANCE SHEET DATA\nThe following table shows selected balance sheet data (in thousands):\nAs of September 30,\n2023 2022\nAccounts receivable, net:\nAccounts receivable $ 61,880 $ 58,967\nLess allowance for credit losses 1,693 3,285\nLess reserve for future credit returns and pricing adjustments 4,190 5,232\nTotal accounts receivable, net $ 55,997 $ 50,450\nInventories:\nRaw materials $ 29,974 $ 39,189\nWork in process 66 592\nFinished goods 44,356 33,442\nTotal inventories $ 74,396 $ 73,223\nProperty, equipment and improvements, net:\nLand $ 570 $ 520\nBuildings 2,338 2,338\nImprovements 11,703 9,365\nEquipment 17,909 17,990\nPurchased software 5,143 4,297\nFurniture and fixtures 2,459 2,148\nSubscriber assets 28,532 24,636\nTotal property, equipment and improvements, gross 68,654 61,294\nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization 39,546 33,700\nTotal property, equipment and improvements, net $ 29,108 $ 27,594\n6. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFinancial assets and liabilities are classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement: Level 1 (unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities); Level 2 (observable market inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1); and Level 3 (unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data). There were no transfers into or out of our Level 2 financial assets during fiscal 2023.\nThere were no assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2023 or 2022.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Opengear, we agreed to make contingent payments, based upon certain revenue thresholds. We paid the first installment of $0.9 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. We paid the final installment of $10.0 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2021.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Haxiot, we agreed to make contingent earn-out payments, based upon certain revenue thresholds (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). In the third quarter of fiscal 2021, the preliminary purchase price allocation was updated, including related determination of fair value and income tax implications. As a result, we adjusted goodwill to $8.6 million and adjusted contingent consideration to $5.9 million on our balance sheet. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, it was determined that the revenue thresholds would not be met and the remaining balance was adjusted down by $5.9 million. The fair value of the remaining liability for contingent consideration for the acquisition of Haxiot was $0.0 million at September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Ctek, we agreed to make contingent earn-out payments, based upon certain revenue thresholds (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, it was determined that the revenue thresholds would not be met and the remaining balance was adjusted down by $0.3 million. The fair value of the remaining liability for contingent consideration for the acquisition of Ctek was $0.0 million at September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n6. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (CONTINUED)\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the contingent consideration liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in thousands):\nYear ended September 30,\n2023 2022\nFair value at beginning of period $ - $ 6,200\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration - (6,200)\nFair value at end of period $ - $ -\nThe change in fair value of contingent consideration reflects our estimate of the probability of achieving the relevant targets and is discounted based on our estimated discount rate. Due to the timing of the acquisition, the fair value of the contingent consideration at September 30, 2023 is based on the probability of achieving the specified revenue thresholds for Ctek. As of September 30, 2023, contingent consideration associated with Ctek remains subject to future performance through December 31, 2023.\n7. INDEBTEDNESS\nOn November 1, 2021, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement with BMO Harris Bank N.A. (\"BMO\"). This agreement provides us with a senior secured credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\") consisting of a $350 million term loan B secured loan (the Term Loan Facility) and a $35 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Loan Facility) with an uncommitted option to increase incremental loans under the Credit Facility, subject to an incremental cap. The Revolving Loan Facility includes a $10 million letter of credit subfacility and $10 million swingline subfacility. Digi may use proceeds of the Revolving Loan Facility in the future for general corporate purposes. This loan replaced our syndicated senior secured credit agreement with BMO that was entered into on March 15, 2021 and replaced the remaining balance of our revolver with this new term loan. This prior agreement provided us with committed credit facilities (\"Prior Credit Facility\") consisting of a $200 million revolving loan.\nThe debt issuance costs and remaining balance under the Prior Credit Facility totaled $2.3 million at November 1, 2021. Of this amount $1.9 million was written off and included in interest expense upon the entry into the new amendment and $0.4 million is being amortized over the term of the amended loan and reported in interest expense. Digi incurred an additional $11.7 million and $1.7 million in debt issuance costs relating to the November 1, 2021 and December 22, 2021 amendments, respectively. These amounts are being amortized over the term of the amended loan and reported in interest expense.\nOn December 22, 2021, Digi entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement with BMO. Digi refinanced the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Loan Facility under its existing credit agreement entered into on November 1, 2021, but did not receive any additional proceeds from nor modify the amounts of any facilities or subfacilities contained within that credit agreement.\nFollowing the December amendment, borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bore interest at a rate based on LIBOR until the discontinuation of LIBOR on June 30, 2023. Following this date, borrowings under the Term Loan Facility are subject to a rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") with a credit spread adjustment to adjust for the change in reference rate ranging from 0.10% to 0.40%, depending on Digi's interest election. Our interest rate has floor of 0.50% for an interest period of one, three or six months as selected by Digi, reset at the end of the selected interest period plus 5.00% or a base rate plus 4.00%. The base rate is determined by reference to the highest of BMOs prime rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, or the one-month SOFR for U.S. dollars plus 1.00%. The applicable margin for loans under the Revolving Credit Facility is in a range of 4.00% to 3.75% for SOFR loans and 3.00% to 2.75% for base rate loans, depending on Digis consolidated leverage ratio. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding balance under the Credit Facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee on the non-utilized commitments thereunder, which is also reported in interest expense.

INDEBTEDNESS (CONTINUED)\nan interest period of one month for the months of December 2021 through April 2022 and a period of six months effective May 1, 2022. Following the expiration of the election on October 31, 2022, Digi elected an interest period of one month, effective on November 1, 2022 and has elected the same periods each subsequent month. Our weighted average interest rate for our Term Loan Facility as of September 30, 2023 was 10.44%. Our weighted average Revolving Loan Facility commitment fee was 0.20% as of September 30, 2023.\nThe Term Loan is payable in quarterly installments, with the balance remaining due on November 2, 2028. The Revolving Loan is due in a lump sum payment at maturity on November 2, 2028, if any amounts are drawn. The fair value of the Term Loan and Revolving Loan approximated carrying value at September 30, 2023.\nDigi made early payments against the term loan of $18.9 million and $100.0 million in twelve months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table is a summary of our long-term indebtedness (in thousands):\nYear ended September 30,\n2023 2022\nTerm loan $ 213,625 $ 250,000\nLess unamortized issuance costs (10,051) (12,029)\nLess current maturities of long-term debt (15,523) (15,523)\nTotal long-term debt, net of current portion $ 188,051 $ 222,448\nThe following table is a summary of future maturities of our aggregate long-term debt at September 30, 2023 (in thousands):\nFiscal year Amount\n2024 $ 17,500\n2025 17,500\n2026 17,500\n2027 17,500\n2028 143,625\nTotal long-term debt $ 213,625\nCovenants and Security Interest\nThe agreements governing the Credit Facility contain a number of covenants. Among other thing, these covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios (net leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge ratio). At September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our assets.\n8.

LEASES\nAll of our leases are operating leases and primarily consist of leases for office space. For any lease with an initial term in excess of twelve months, the related lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as either operating or financing leases at the inception of an agreement where it is determined that a lease exists. We have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. We have elected to combine lease and non-lease components for all classes of assets. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Instead we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nOperating lease assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments. These assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future payments over the lease term at the commencement date. We generally use a collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date, including the lease term, in determining the present value of future payments. When determining our right-of-use asset, we generally do not include options to extend or terminate the lease unless it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.\nOur leases typically require payment of real estate taxes and common area maintenance and insurance. These components comprise the majority of our variable lease cost and are excluded from the present value of our lease obligations. Fixed payments may contain predetermined fixed rent escalations. We recognize the related rent expense on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the end of the lease term.\nThe following table shows the supplemental balance sheet information related to our leases (in thousands):\nBalance Sheet Location September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022\nAssets\nOperating leases Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 12,876 $ 15,299\nTotal lease assets $ 12,876 $ 15,299\nLiabilities\nOperating leases Current portion of operating lease liabilities $ 3,352 $ 3,196\nOperating leases Operating lease liabilities 13,989 16,978\nTotal lease liabilities $ 17,341 $ 20,174\nThe following were the components of our lease cost which is recorded in both cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expense (in thousands):\nStatement of Operations Location Year ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 Year ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nOperating lease cost Cost of goods sold and SG&A $ 3,815 $ 3,783\nVariable lease cost Cost of goods sold and SG&A 1,332 1,094\nShort-term lease cost Cost of goods sold and SG&A 93 109\nTotal lease cost $ 5,240 $ 4,986\nThe following table presents supplemental information related to operating leases (in thousands):\nYear ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 Year ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 2,965 $ 2,998\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities $ 276 $ 2,615\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n9.

RESTRUCTURING\n2021 Restructuring\nOn October 7, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a reorganization of our IoT Products & Services business segment. The restructuring plan aligned the business segment's organization around product lines. Under this plan, we recorded a charge of $0.7 million for employee termination charges and eliminated 19 employment positions primarily in the U.S. during the three months ended December 31, 2020. In the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we recorded an additional $0.2 million related to this restructuring. In the third quarter of fiscal 2021 we recorded an additional $0.1 million related to this restructuring. The charges relating to this restructuring were fully paid during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\nBelow is a summary of the restructuring charges and other activity within the restructuring accrual (in thousands):\n2021 Restructuring\nEmployee Termination Costs Total\nBalance on September 30, 2020 $ - $ -\nRestructuring charge 995 995\nPayments (935) (935)\nReversals - -\nForeign currency fluctuation (60) (60)\nBalance on September 30, 2021 $ - $ -\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n11.

Subscriber assets are equipment that we provide to customers pursuant to subscription-based contracts. In these cases, we retain the ownership of the equipment a customer uses and charge the customer subscription fees to receive our end-to-end solutions. The total net book value of subscriber assets of $16.6 million and $16.5 million as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively, are included in property, equipment and improvements, net. Depreciation expense for these subscriber assets was $3.8 million and $3.2 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We depreciate the cost of this equipment over its useful life and include these expenses in cost of sales.\nContract Assets\nContract assets at Digi consist of products and services that have been fulfilled, but for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Our contract asset balances were immaterial as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022.\nContract Liabilities\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Customers are invoiced for subscription services on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. Contract liabilities consist of unearned revenue related to annual or multi-year contracts for subscription services and related implementation fees, as well as product sales that have been invoiced, but not yet fulfilled.\nOur contract liabilities were $27.9 million and $21.6 million at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOf the $21.6 million and $15.5 million balances as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, Digi recognized $17.5 million and $13.2 million as revenue in the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nRemaining Performance Obligation\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had approximately $152.5 million of remaining performance obligations on contracts with an original duration of one year or more. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately $88.4 million of remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months. Revenue from the remaining performance obligations we expect to recognize over a range of two to five years.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n12.

We also had $0.6 million of carryforwards consisting of U.S. net operating losses of $0.2 million, non-U.S. net operating losses of $0.2 million and foreign tax credits of $0.2 million. The majority of our state research and development tax credits have a 15-year carryforward period. The majority of our non-U.S. net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards have an unlimited carryforward period. Our valuation allowance for certain U.S. and foreign attributes was $3.3 million at September 30, 2023 and $3.0 million at September 30, 2022. The increase in valuation allowance is primarily the result of additional reserves against state research and development credits. The deferred tax assets realized could vary if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities or changes in the amounts of future taxable income. If future taxable income projections are not realized, an additional valuation allowance may be required. This would be reflected as income tax expense at the time that any such change in future taxable income is determined.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n12.

We expect that it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of UTB will decrease by approximately $0.4 million over the next 12 months due to the expiration of various statutes of limitations. Of the $3.2 million of UTB, $2.3 million is included in non-current income taxes payable and $0.9 million is included with non-current deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2023.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, there were insignificant amounts of interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. We accrued $0.1 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2023 and 2022. These accrued interest and penalties are included in our non-current income taxes payable on our consolidated balance sheets.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n12. INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)\nWe operate in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. and face audits from various tax authorities regarding transfer pricing, tax credits, and other matters. Accordingly we must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions. This determination requires us to make several estimates and assumptions. Tax audits associated with the allocation of this income, and other complex issues, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in adjustments to our income tax balances in those years that are material to our consolidated balance sheets and results of operations.\nWe file a U.S. federal income tax return and income tax returns in various states and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to state and local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities.\nAt September 30, 2023, the majority of undistributed foreign earnings were taxed under the one time transition tax and the global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additionally, the previously un-taxed accumulated undistributed foreign earnings from prior fiscal years are still permanently reinvested and, as such, we have not accrued additional U.S. tax. It is our position that the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are to be reinvested indefinitely to fund current operations and provide for future international expansion opportunities and only repatriate earnings to the extent that U.S. taxes have already been recorded. As of September 30, 2023, we are permanently reinvested with respect to previously non-taxed accumulated earnings in all jurisdictions.\nAlthough we have no current need to repatriate historical foreign earnings that have not been taxed in the U.S., if we change our assertion from indefinitely reinvesting undistributed foreign earnings, we would have to accrue applicable taxes. The amount of any taxes and the application of any tax credits would be determined based on the income tax laws at the time of such repatriation. Under current tax law, we estimate the unrecognized tax liability to be immaterial.\n13. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nPublic Offering of Common Stock\nDuring March 2021 we sold 4,025,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $19.50 per share. The shares offered were registered pursuant to a registration statement that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We received net proceeds of $73.8 million, net of transaction expenses of $0.3 million related to the public offering.\n14. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nStock-based awards granted in 2023 were granted under the amended and restated 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the \"2021 Plan\"). Shares subject to awards under the 2021 Plan or any prior plans that are forfeited, canceled, returned to us for failure to satisfy vesting requirements, settled in cash or otherwise terminated without payment also will be available for grant under the 2021 Plan. The authority to grant options under the 2021 Plan and set other terms and conditions rests with the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe 2021 Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 3,500,000 common shares in connection with awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance-based full value awards or other stock-based awards. Eligible participants include our employees, our affiliates, non-employee directors of our Company and any consultant or advisor who is a natural person and provides services to us or our affiliates. Options that have been granted under the 2021 Plan typically vest over a four-year period and will expire if unexercised after seven years from the date of grant. Restricted stock unit awards (\"RSUs\") that have been granted to directors typically vest in one year. RSUs that have been granted to executives and employees typically vest in January over a four-year period. Performance stock unit awards (\"PSUs\") that have been granted to an executive will vest based on achievement of a cumulative adjusted earnings per share metric measured over a three-year period. Share-based compensation expenses recorded for this performance award is reevaluated at each reporting period based on the probability of achievement of the goal. The Amended Plan is scheduled to expire on January 28, 2032. Options under the Amended Plan can be granted as either incentive stock options or non-statutory stock options. The exercise price of options and the grant date price of RSUs and PSUs is determined by our Compensation Committee but will not be less than the fair market value of our common stock based on the closing price as of the date of grant. Upon exercise of options or settlement of vested RSUs or PSUs, we issue new shares of stock. As of September 30, 2023, there were approximately 2,365,365 shares available for future grants under the Amended Plan.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n14. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)\nStock-based awards granted in 2022 and 2021 were granted under the 2021 Plan before amendments were made to increase the number of authorized shares. There were no other material changes to the plan made in the amendments.\nCash received from the exercise of stock options was $3.9 million, $9.5 million and $8.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our stock option plans allow the net exercise of options. Shares with a value of $0.2 million and $4.3 million were forfeited to satisfy tax withholding for the year ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. No amount was forfeited in fiscal 2021.\nOur equity plans and corresponding forms of award agreements generally have provisions allowing employees to elect to satisfy tax withholding obligations through the delivery of shares, having us retain a portion of shares issuable under the award or paying cash to us for the withholding. During fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 our employees forfeited 106,012, 102,392 and 116,195 shares, respectively in order to satisfy $4.1 million, $2.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively, of withholding tax obligations related to stock-based compensation, pursuant to terms of awards under our board and shareholder-approved compensation plans.\nWe sponsor an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended and restated as of December 10, 2019 (the \"Purchase Plan\"), covering all domestic employees with at least 90 days of continuous service and who are customarily employed at least 20 hours per week. The Purchase Plan allows eligible participants the right to purchase common stock on a quarterly basis at the lower of 85% of the market price at the beginning or end of each three-month offering period. The most recent amendments to the Purchase Plan, ratified by our stockholders on January 29, 2020, increased the total number of shares to 3,425,000 that may be purchased under the plan. Employee contributions to the Purchase Plan were $2.3 million, $1.5 million and $1.2 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Pursuant to the Purchase Plan, 82,621, 80,225, and 78,644 shares of common stock were issued to employees during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Shares are issued under the Purchase Plan from treasury stock. As of September 30, 2023, 470,227 shares of common stock were available for future issuances under the Purchase Plan.\nStock-based compensation expense is included in the consolidated results of operations as (in thousands):\nYear ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nCost of sales $ 628 $ 466 $ 371\nSales and marketing 4,107 2,503 2,069\nResearch and development 1,777 1,236 1,032\nGeneral and administrative 6,774 4,373 4,663\nStock-based compensation before income taxes 13,286 8,578 8,135\nIncome tax benefit (2,840) (1,819) (1,755)\nStock-based compensation after income taxes $ 10,446 $ 6,759 $ 6,380\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n14.

The total intrinsic value of all options exercised during each of the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $5.2 million, $20.3 million and $6.5 million, respectively.\nThe table below shows the weighted average fair value, which was determined based upon the fair value of each option on the grant date utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the related assumptions:\nYear ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nWeighted average per option grant date fair value $ 19.87 $ 10.37 $ 6.97\nAssumptions used for option grants:\nRisk free interest rate 3.50% - 4.15%\n1.25% - 3.00%\n0.51% - 1.04%\nExpected term 6.00 years 6.00 years 6.00 years\nExpected volatility 46% 45% - 46%\n44% - 46%\nWeighted average volatility 46% 46% 45%\nExpected dividend yield 0% 0% 0%\nThe fair value of each option award granted during the periods presented was estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the above table. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our stock. We use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination information within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted is derived from the vesting period and historical information and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.

The employer matching contribution was reinstated for all employees after a suspension effective May 3, 2020 and ending on December 31, 2020 in the United States and Canada. We provided matching contributions of $3.4 million for fiscal 2023, $3.1 million for fiscal 2022 and $2.4 million for fiscal 2021. In addition, we may make contributions to the plan at the discretion of the Board of Directors.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLeases\nWe lease certain of our buildings and equipment under noncancelable lease agreements. Please refer to Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nLitigation\nIn November 2018, DimOnOff Inc., a company headquartered in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (\"DimOnOff\"), which sells control systems in the building automation and street lighting markets sued us and a former distributor from whom DimOnOff purchased certain Digi products. The suit was brought in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec in the District of Quebec (Canada) and alleges certain Digi products it purchased and incorporated into street lighting systems in a Canadian city were defective causing some of the street lights to malfunction. It alleged damages of just over CAD 1.0 million. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the lawsuit was settled and no payment will be made by us. However, we will be providing DimOnOff reduced product pricing on a limited number of products for an amount substantially lower than what was claimed in the lawsuit.\nData Logger Solutions, LLC (\"Data Loggers\") brought suit in Delaware Superior Court against us and our subsidiary Digi SmartSense, LLC in October, 2020. The suit alleges that Data Loggers has not been paid certain commissions it believes it is owed and will continue to be owed under a Reseller Agreement entered between Data Loggers and TempAlert. SmartSense is the successor of interest of TempAlert and terminated the Reseller Agreement in 2019. Data Loggers claims it is entitled to actual, speculative and punitive damages in connection with its allegations. Digi and SmartSense have made counterclaims against Data Loggers for breach of contract. Each party has submitted a motion for summary judgement in this case and a hearing is scheduled for January 2024. Pending a decision on each partys summary judgement motion, a trial presently is scheduled to commence in February 2024. We believe we have strong defenses against the allegations asserted by Data Loggers. We intend to defend the matter vigorously; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such defense. We are unable to estimate the total costs to defend the matter or the potential liability to us in the event that we are not successful in our defense.\nIn addition to the matters discussed above, in the normal course of business, we are presently, and expect in the future to be, subject to various claims and litigation with third parties such as non-practicing intellectual property entities as well as customers, vendors and/or employees. There can be no assurance that any claims by third parties, if proven to have merit, will not materially adversely affect our business, liquidity or financial condition. ITEM 9.

Based on their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d - 15(e) under the Security Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective and provide reasonable assurance on the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of Digi's financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023.\nIn making this assessment, management used the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management concluded that Digi's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023 based on Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Digi International Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Digi International Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023, of the Company and our report dated November 22, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nNovember 22, 2023 ITEM 9B.
