    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nWe are a business consulting company providing financial consulting services to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and prior to August 1, 2022, we manage a private equity fund with approximately $1.3 million assets under management (AUM). Since our inception in 2015, the main focus of our consulting business has been providing comprehensive going public consulting services designed to help SMEs become public companies on suitable markets and exchanges. Our goal is to become an international financial consulting company with clients and offices throughout Asia and North America. On January 4, 2021, we established an office in California, USA, through our wholly owned subsidiary ATIF Inc., a California corporation, which was incorporated on October 26, 2020, and launched, in addition to our business consulting services, additional service models consisting of asset management, investment holding and media services to expand our business with a flexible business concept to achieve a goal of high growth revenue and strong profit growth.\nWe have to date primarily focused on helping clients going public on the OTC markets and exchanges in the U.S., but we are in the process of expanding our service to listing clients on domestic exchanges in China as well as the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\nRecent Developments\nOn February 3, 2021, we terminated our VIE agreements with Qianhai and upon termination, Qianhai transferred all of its business and employees to Huaya. In addition, on January 29, 2021, we sold our 51.2% equity interest in LGC. As a result of termination of relationship with shareholders of Qianhai and sale of all our equity interests in LGC, since February 3, 2021, we have no VIE structure in connection with our operations.\nOn February 16, 2021, we established ATIF-1, LP (ATIF LP) as a private equity fund through our indirectly-wholly owned subsidiary, ATIF-1 GP, LLC (ATIF GP), a Delaware limited liability company, as the general partner. As of July 31, 2022, we own a 76.6% interest in ATIF LP as a limited partner. As of July 31, 2022, ATIF LP manages, approximately $1.3 million assets under management (AUM). The investment strategy of the fund involves directional long and short investments in equity securities, primarily issued by U.S. large capitalization companies, and American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) related to Chinese companies of various sizes, including private companies. The investment manager for the fund is ATIF Inc. Due to significant volatility in stock market, the private equity fund lost $1.5 million in fiscal year 2022 as compared to gain $0.2 million in fiscal year 2021. On August 1, 2022, ATIF USA entered into and closed a Sale and Purchase Agreement with Asia Time (HK) International Finance Service Limited (the Buyer) pursuant to which ATIF US sold all of its membership interests in ATIF GP (the Agreement) to the Buyer for cash consideration of US$50,000. Upon the closing of the Agreement on August 1, 2022, ATIF GP is no longer our subsidiary and ATIF USA ceased to be the investment manager of ATIF LP.\nOn August 23, 2021, we completed a five (5) for one (1) reverse stock split (the Reverse Split) of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares, par value $0.001 per share.\nOn December 22, 2021, we established ATIF BD LLC, a California limited liability company (ATIF BD) and our wholly-owned subsidiary, engaged in consultancy and information technology support services.\nOn April 25, 2022, we established ATIF Investment Limited, a British Virgin Islands company (ATIF Investment) and our wholly-owned subsidiary, engaged in consultancy and information technology support services.\nOn May 31, 2022, we completed the transfer of our equity interest in ATIF HK and Huaya to Mr. Pishan Chi, our former director and CEO, for $nil consideration. The transfer of equity interest was to mitigate the potential risks arising from the PRC government provision of new guidance to and restrictions on China-based companies raising capital offshore. We determined that the transfer of our equity interest in ATIF HK and Huaya did not have a major effect on its operations and financial results as we did not change our way of running business. We also determined that the transfer of equity interest does not represent a strategic shift in our business because there was no change to our operation of our consulting services. There was no change to the nature of our business, and did not affect our customers in North America, which is the major geographic market area of our business.\nOn October 3, 2022, we established ATIF Southern US, LLC (ATIF Southern), a California LLC, of which we own 60% of its membership interest, and is engaged in equity investment business in Texas.\nOn October 6, 2022, we established ATIF Business Consulting LLC, a California LLC (ATIF Consulting) and our wholly-owned subsidiary, engaged in IPO consulting services in North America.\nOn October 7, 2022, we established ATIF Business Management LLC, a California LLC (ATIF Management) and our wholly-owned subsidiary, engaged in comprehensive services such as IR, legal services and secretarial services in North America in future.\nCompetitive Strengths\nWe believe that the following strengths enable us to capture opportunities in the financial service industry in China and differentiate us from our competitors:\nExperienced and Highly Qualified Team\nWe have a highly qualified professional service team with extensive experience in going public consulting services. Our professional team members have an average of five years of experience in their respective fields of international finance and capital market, cross-border and domestic listing services, and marketing. The majority of the members of our team previously worked in the technology or finance industries. We highly value members of our qualified professional team and are on the constant lookout for new talents to join our team.\nRecognition and Reputation Achieved from Our Previous Success\nSince our inception in 2015, we have successfully helped eight clients to be quoted on the U.S. OTC markets and one client listed on the U.S Nasdaq market, respectively. Our proven track records and professionalism have won us recognition and reputation within the consulting service industry in China. We believe we are one of the few going public consulting service providers that possess the necessary resources and expertise to provide comprehensive personalized one-stop going public consulting services to clients.\nLong-Term Cooperation Relationship with Third-Party Professional Providers\nWe have established long-term professional relationships with a group of well-known third-party professional providers both domestically and in the U.S., such as investment banks, certified public accounting firms, law firms, and investor relations agencies, whose services and support are necessary for us to provide high-quality one-stop going public consulting service to our clients. It took us years of hard work to demonstrate to these professional organizations that we are a worthy partner capable of providing high-quality professional services that conforms to their high standards. As a result, our clients are able to gain direct access to and obtain high-quality professional services from our third-party professional providers.\nLong-Term Cooperation Relationships with Local Chamber of Commerce and Associations\nWe believe our recent success was at least partially attributable to our long-term cooperation relationships with local chambers of commerce and associations. There are no contractual relationships between us and these organizations. We were able to gain access to many prospective clients through events organized by these organizations. Our cooperation relationships with these local organizations help us to: (1) understand the evolving needs of our potential clients; (2) recognize the trends of the local business community we strive to serve; and (3) provide timely feedbacks to our potential clients and maintain open communication channels with local business communities.\nDESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS\nOur Business\nWe are a British Virgin Islands business company. We are a business consulting company providing financial consulting services to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Since our inception in 2015, the focus of our consulting business has been providing comprehensive going public consulting services designed to help SMEs become public companies on suitable markets and exchanges. Our goal is to become an international financial consulting company with clients and offices throughout Asia and North America. On January 4, 2021, we established an office in California, USA, through our wholly owned subsidiary ATIF Inc., a California corporation, which was incorporated on October 26, 2020, and launched, in addition to our business consulting services, additional service models consisting of asset management, investment holding and media services to expand our business with a flexible business concept to achieve a goal of high growth revenue and strong profit growth. Clients located within United States will be serviced by ATIF Inc., while clients outside United States will be supported by ATIF Inc.s business strategic cooperative partner Huaya.\nSince our inception, our revenue has been mainly generated from our going public consulting services. In April 2020, we acquired a 51.2% equity interest in Leaping Group Co., Ltd. (LGC) and our revenue was mainly comprised of going public consulting services and event execution and planning services for the year ended July 31, 2020. On January 29, 2021, we completed a disposition of 51.2% of the equity interest of LGC with three individuals. For the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, we reported net loss of $6.6 million and $11.0 million from discontinued operations of LGC as a separate component in the consolidated statements of operations.\nBeginning in August 2018, to complement and facilitate the growth of our going public consulting service, we launched AT Consulting Center to offer financial consulting programs in Shenzhen, and in September 2018, we acquired CNNM, or www.chinacnnm.com, a news and media website focused on distributing financial news and information. In July 2019, we launched an investment and financing analysis reporting business. We have not generated any revenue from this financial and news platform since its acquisition, and based on our current financial condition and operating performance, our management has assessed that the likelihood of future use of the financial and news platform is remote, and we provided full impairment on the financial and news platform in the year ended July 31, 2020.\nIn China, a fast-growing economy and a positive market environment have created many entrepreneurial and high-growth enterprises, many of which need assistance in obtaining development funds through financing. Due to restrictions imposed by Chinas foreign exchange regulations, it is difficult for foreign capital to enter Chinas capital market. Because of the strict listing policies and a relatively closed financial environment in mainland China, most small to medium sized enterprises in the development stage are unable to list on domestic exchanges in China. Therefore, many Chinese enterprises strive to enter international capital markets through overseas listing for equity financing. However, in China, there is a general lack of understanding of the international capital markets, as well as a lack of professional institutions that provide overseas going public consulting services to these companies, and many of them may not be familiar with overseas listing requirements.\nWe launched our consulting services in 2015. Our aim was to assist these Chinese enterprises by filling the gaps and forming a bridge between PRC companies and overseas markets and exchanges. We have a team of qualified and experienced personnel with legal, regulatory, and language expertise in several overseas jurisdictions. Our services are designed to help SMEs in China achieve their goal of becoming public companies. We create a going public strategy for each client based on many factors, including our assessment of the clients financial and operational situations, market conditions, and the clients business and financing requirements. Since our inception and up to July 31, 2022, we have successfully helped eight Chinese enterprises to be quoted on the U.S. OTC markets and are currently assisting our other clients in their respective going public efforts. All of our current and past clients have been Chinese companies, and we plan to expand our operations to other Asian countries, such as Malaysia, Vietnam, and Singapore, by as opportunities arises.\nOn January 4, 2021, we announced the relocation of our operating headquarter to California, USA, through our wholly owned subsidiary ATIF Inc., a California corporation incorporated on October 26, 2020, and launched, in addition to our business consulting services, additional service models consisting of asset management, investment holding and media services to expand our business with a flexible business concept to achieve a goal of high growth revenue and strong profit growth. As part of this relocation and to streamline the management chain and to improve management control with a goal of lower costs, we transition the services from our variable interest entity (VIE), Qianhai Asia Times (Shenzhen) International Financial Services Co., Ltd. (Qianhai), to ATIF Inc. and Huaya, and terminated the VIE agreements with Qianhai on January 31, 2021. Before the termination, operating revenue generated through Qianhai VIE amounted to $645,127, and net income (loss) amounted to $(1,562,037) for the years ended July 31, 2020. The termination of the Qianhai VIE agreements did not cause a material impairment of our long-lived assets (primarily including fixed assets such as office furniture and equipment and automobile) because such assets only amounted to $184,740 and $68,375 as of July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. All of the fixed assets were transferred to Huaya upon termination of the VIE agreement. In addition, we had discussions with other business organizations to collaborate with a goal of leveraging their resources to assist us to grow our business centers in other jurisdictions. We believe that this streamlined management model and strategic partnership strategy is in line with the current fast-changing and competitive business environment and will provide us with strong growth capability. The termination of the VIE agreement with Qianhai did not adversely affect Huaya, our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOn January 14, 2021, the Company entered into the Sale and Purchase Agreement with the majority shareholders of LGC consisting of Jiang Bo, Jiang Tao and Wang Di (collectively the LGC Buyers) to sell all interests in LGC. Pursuant to the Sales and Purchase Agreement, the Company sold 10,217,230 ordinary shares of LGC in exchange for (i) 5,555,548 ordinary shares of the Company owned by the LGC Buyers, and (ii) payment by the LGC Buyers in the amount of US$2,300,000 plus interest at an interest rate of 10% per annum on the unpaid amount if the principal amount of US$2,300,000 is not paid by January 14, 2022. All principal and accrued and unpaid interest shall be due on January 14, 2023. As of the date of this prospectus, the 5,555,548 shares of ordinary shares owned by the LGC Buyers have been returned to the Company and the $2.3 million cash payment has not yet been received from the LGC Buyers. The Company recognized an estimated loss of approximately $6.1 million from this transaction, which were reflected in the pro forma financial information as included in the Companys form 6-K as filed with SEC on February 4, 2021. After completion of the transaction, the Company shall no longer hold any shares of LGC and LGC shall no longer be subsidiary of ATIF. The Sales and Purchase Agreement closed on January 29, 2021.\nWe entered into the Sale Purchase Agreement because we believed that due to the continued impact of COVID-19 in China, it will take longer, and additional capital will be required for traditional entertainment and cinemas businesses like LGC to recover. Further, in light of the Company moving its headquarter to California and transitioning to a new business model focusing on business consulting, asset management, investment holding and media services, the Company no longer believes that its business has synergy with LGCs cinema advertising and cinema operation business. Our management and LGCs management also had different views of LGCs future business direction.\nOn February 16, 2021, we established ATIF-1, LP (ATIF LP) as a private equity fund through our indirectly-wholly owned subsidiary, ATIF-1 GP, LLC (ATIF GP), a Delaware limited liability company, as the general partner. As of July 31, 2022, we own a 76.6% limited partner interest in ATIF LP. ATIF LP manages, as of July 31, 2022, approximately $1.3 million assets under management (AUM). The investment strategy of the fund involves directional long and short investments in equity securities, primarily issued by U.S. large capitalization companies, and American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) related to Chinese companies of various sizes, including private companies. The investment manager for the fund is ATIF Inc. Due to significant volatility in stock market, the private equity fund lost $1.5 million in fiscal year 2022 as compared to gain $0.2 million in fiscal year 2021. On August 1, 2022, ATIF USA entered into and closed a Sale and Purchase Agreement with Asia Time (HK) International Finance Service Limited (the Buyer), pursuant to which ATIF USA sold all of its membership interests in ATIF GP (the Agreement) to the Buyer for cash consideration of US$50,000. Upon the closing of the Agreement, ATIF GP is no longer our subsidiary and ATIF USA ceased to be the investment manager of ATIF LP.\nOn May 31, 2022, we completed the transfer of our equity interest in ATIF HK and Huaya to Mr. Pishan Chi for $nil consideration. The transfer of equity interest was to mitigate the potential risks arising from the PRC government provision of new guidance to and restrictions on China-based companies raising capital offshore. We determined that the transfer of our equity interest in ATIF HK and Huaya did not have a major effect on our operations and financial results as we did not change our way of running business. We also determined that the transfer of equity interest does not represent a strategic shift in our business because there was no change to our operation of our consulting services. There was no change to the nature of our business, and did not affect our customers in North America, which is the major geographic market area of our business. However, we intend to continue cooperating with Huaya in connection with the expansion and provision of our business services in China. Before the disposal of ATIF HK and Huaya, operating revenue generated through Huaya amounted to $366,508 and $401,292, and net income (loss) amounted to $(812,434) and $86,758 for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively. The disposal of Huaya did not cause a material impairment of our long-lived assets (primarily including fixed assets such as office furniture and equipment and automobile) because it had no long-lived assets as of May 31, 2022.\nMarketing and Sales\nWe believe the success of our consulting business requires building mutually beneficial long-term relationships with relevant and influential entities, and we have developed our main marketing channels based on these relationships.\nSince our inception, we have cultivated and maintained cooperation with a number of city and provincial chambers of commerce and business associations in China, including the Zhejiang Chamber of Commerce in Shenzhen and Guangdong, Shenzhen Industrial Park Association, Meixian Chamber of Commerce in Shenzhen, Wenzhou Chamber of Commerce in Shenyang, Shenzhen Elite Chamber of Commerce, and the SME Service Platform in Northeast China. There are no contractual relationships between us and these organizations. However, these local business organizations have helped our marketing efforts greatly, due to the fact that: (1) they have access to the information of local enterprises and often recommend and connect us with potential clients; (2) they help us organize going public briefings and international financial lectures with local enterprises; and (3) they are able to utilize relationships with local government to initiate and organize government sponsored financial forums to promote and introduce our consulting services to the local enterprises.\nWe also strive to maintain professional relationships with our former and prospective clients. Our former clients have benefited from our services and oftentimes are willing and able to introduce prospective clients to us. After nearly three years operating as a consulting service provider specialized in cross-border going public services, we have developed a database consisting of former and prospective clients, using each as a resource for business connections and social relations.\nOur employees have been working in various industries for many years, and accumulated networks of business and social relations including personal connections, corporate associations, and governmental affiliations, which are all valuable resources through which we can potentially obtain new clients.\nWe are constantly seeking new and effective marketing channels in order to grow into an international consulting company with clients and branches throughout Asia. To complement and facilitate our growth perspectives, in 2018, we launched AT Consulting Center, we believe, it has the great potential in becoming instrumental in our marketing efforts for continued growth of our consulting business.\nIn addition to our marketing efforts described above, we also market our consulting services, through:\n\u25cf Social media, principally WeChat and Weibo;\n\u25cf Newsletters to our prospective clients; and\n\u25cf Business relationships with well-known corporations and web platforms with large online traffics that can direct traffic to our website through links on their websites.\nCompetition\nWe face competition from a number of consulting companies providing going public consulting services such as Greenpro Capital Corp., Forward Capital, and Dragon Victory, who recently entered going public consulting services in 2018. We believe that our relatively mature operating history of nearly three years differentiates our company from other competitors. Our comprehensive one-stop consulting services, through which we are directly involved in each of the three pre-defined phases of our clients going public process, are unlike the services provided by many of our competitors, who often act as mere initial order takers, and then outsource a majority of services to third-party providers.\nCurrently, many of the going public consulting providers in China operate on a relatively small scale, only with a few employees. We believe that we are currently one of the few consulting companies capable of providing comprehensive one-stop going public services to qualified enterprises. However, due to favorable market conditions, which may have been overheated by various Chinese government stimulus programs offered recently to encourage and reward enterprises going public, a number of companies have entered and are entering the going public consulting business. As such, we expect competition will become more intense, and it is possible that we will not be able to maintain the growth rate we have achieved previously.\nMajor Customers\nThe majority of our clients are small to medium-sized enterprises seeking growth and expansion through going public on recognized exchanges, and $1.6 million and $0.9 million was generated from our consulting services for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Since our inception in 2015 through July 31, 2022, most of our former and current clients were based in mainland China. The number of our new consulting service clients was five and three for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Due to the nature of our consulting business, which requires us to dedicate a large amount of resources to each of our clients, we were able to generate a relatively large revenue from a small number of clients. As a result, we had three and three clients that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues, for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As we continue to expand and grow the number of clients, we expect the risks arising from customer concentration will be mitigated accordingly.\nEmployees\nAs of July 31, 2022, we had 11 full-time employees, including 1 in China and 10 in America. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with us. We believe our employee relations are good.\nIntellectual Property\nWe have received the approval for the following trademark registrations:\nTrademark Jurisdiction Category Effective Date Expiration Date\nATIF China May 7, 2019 May 6, 2029\nATIF Hong Kong January 31, 2019 August 28, 2028\n\u4e9a\u6d32\u65f6\u4ee3 China May 14, 2017 May 13, 2027\n\u4e9e\u6d32\u6642\u4ee3 Hong Kong 35;36;41 November 26, 2019 April 11, 2029\nCNNM Hong Kong 35; August 29, 2018 August 28, 2028\nINTERNATIONAL SCHOOL OF FINANCE Hong Kong August 29, 2018 August 28, 2028\nIPOEX Hong Kong October 27, 2020 October 26, 2030\nIPOEX European Union January 30, 2021 October 15, 2030\nIPOEX China July 28, 2021 July 27, 2031\nIPOEX Singapore October 15, 2020 October 15, 2030\nIPOEX United Kingdom February 19, 2021 October 19, 2030\nIPOEX Korea February 21, 2022 February 21, 2032\nWe also own five domain names: ipoex.com, atifus.com, atifchina, chinacnnm.com and dpoex.com.\nBelow are images of our trademarks:\nGovernment Regulations\nPRC Regulations\nWe operate our business in China under a legal regime consisting of the National Peoples Congress, which is the countrys highest legislative body, the State Council, which is the highest authority of the executive branch of the PRC central government, and several ministries and agencies under its authority, including the SAIC, and their respective local offices, and Ministry of Housing & Urban-Rural Development (the MHURD) and their respective local offices. This section summarizes the principal PRC regulations applicable to our business.\nPRC Laws and Regulations relating to Foreign Investment\nInvestment activities in the PRC by foreign investors were principally governed by the Guidance Catalog of Industries for Foreign Investment, promulgated and as amended from time to time by MOFCOM and National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), which was later divided into two legal documents, including the Catalog of Industries for Encouraged Foreign Investment, or the Encouraged Catalog, and the Special Administrative Measures for Access of Foreign Investment (Negative List), or the Negative List. Industries listed in the Negative List are divided into two categories: restricted and prohibited. Industries not listed in the Negative List are generally constituted permitted, and are open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations. For restricted industries, some are limited to equity or contractual joint ventures, while in some cases Chinese partners are required to hold the majority interests in such joint ventures. In addition, restricted category projects are subject to higher-level government approvals. Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in industries in the prohibited category. The latest Negative List was released by MOFCOM and NDRC on September 18,2021 and became effective on January 1, 2022. Pursuant to the current and the updated Negative Lists, management consulting is an permitted industry for foreign investment access.\nPRC Laws and Regulations on Company Establishment\nThe establishment, operation, and management of companies in the PRC is governed by the PRC Company Law, or the Company Law, as promulgated by the SCNPC on December 29, 1993, effective on July 1, 1994, and subsequently amended in 1999, 2004, 2005, 2013, and 2018. According to the Company Law, companies established in the PRC are either limited liability companies or joint stock limited liability companies. The Company Law applies to both domestic companies and foreign-invested companies.\nOn March 15, 2019, the National Peoples Congress approved the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, or the Foreign Investment Law, which came into effect on January 1, 2020, repealing simultaneously the Law of the PRC on Sino-foreign Equity Joint Ventures, the Law of the PRC on Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprises, and the Law of the PRC on Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Ventures. The Foreign Investment Law adopts the management system of pre-establishment national treatment and negative list for foreign investment. Policies in support of enterprises shall apply equally to foreign-funded enterprises according to laws and regulations. Foreign investment enterprises shall be guaranteed that they could equally participate in the setting of standards, and the compulsory standards formulated by the State shall be equally applied. Fair competition for foreign investment enterprises to participate in government procurement activities shall be protected. The Foreign Investment Law also stipulates the protection on intellectual property rights and trade secrets. In addition, Regulations for the Implementation of the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC came into effect as of January 1, 2020.\nNotice on the Implementation of Foreign Investment Law and the Registration of Foreign-funded Enterprises was issued by the State Administration for Market Regulation on December 31, 2019. According to such notice, the State Administration for Market Regulation conducts business registration, and the applicant shall apply for the registration of foreign-funded enterprises through the enterprise registration system. The registration authority shall conduct formal examination on relevant application materials. Where a foreign investor or enterprise with foreign investment invests in a field other than those in the negative list, it shall register in accordance with the principle of consistency of domestic and foreign investment.\nThe Measures for Reporting Foreign Investment Information were adopted by MOFCOM on December 19, 2019, approved by the State Administration for Market Regulation, and became effective on January 1, 2020. According to such measures, when a foreign investor directly or indirectly conducts investment activities in China, the foreign investor or foreign-invested enterprise shall submit investment information to the competent department of commerce in accordance with the measures.\nPRC Laws and Regulations Relating to Management Consulting Industry\nLaw of the Peoples Republic of China on Promotion of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (the SME Promotion Law) was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress on June 29, 2002, amended on September 1, 2017, and became effective on January 1, 2018. According to the SME Promotion Law, the government encourage all kinds of services organization to provide services including training and counselling on entrepreneurship, intellectual property protection, management consulting, information consulting, credit service, marketing, development of projects, investment and financing, accounting and taxation, equity transaction, technology support, talent introduction, foreign cooperation, exhibition, and legal consulting.\nPursuant to the Opinions of the State Council on Further Promoting The Development of Small And Medium-sized Enterprises (the Opinions), which were promulgated by the State Council on September 19, 2009, the government supports organizations of management consulting for SMEs and activities of management consulting to guide SMEs to use external sources to improve their level on management.\nAccording to the SME Promotion Law and the Opinions, our business is encouraged by the government and is in compliance with relevant regulations in PRC. There are no further regulations on management consulting industry in the PRC presently. However, we cannot assure that there will not be more regulations on the management consulting industry to be issued by PRC government in the future that could affect our business.\nRegulation on Intellectual Property Rights\nRegulations on trademarks\nThe Trademark Law of the Peoples Republic of China was adopted at the 24th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Fifth National Peoples Congress on August 23, 1982. Three amendments were made on February 22, 1993, October 27, 2001, and August 30, 2013, respectively. The last amendment was implemented on May 1, 2014. The regulations on the implementation of the trademark law of the Peoples Republic of China were promulgated by the State Council of the Peoples Republic of China on August 3, 2002, and took effect on September 15, 2002. It was revised on April 29, 2014 and April 23, 2019. The PRC Trademark Office under the State Administration of Market Regulation handles trademark registrations and grants a term of 10 years to registered trademarks and another 10 years if requested upon expiration of the first or any renewed 10-year term. Trademark license agreements must be filed with the PRC Trademark Office for record. The PRC Trademark Law has adopted a first-to-file principle with respect to trademark registration. Where a trademark to be registered is identical or similar to another trademark which has already been registered or been subject to a preliminary examination and approval for use on the same kind of or similar goods or services, the application for registration of such trademark may be rejected. Any person applying for the registration of a trademark may not prejudice the existing right first obtained by others, nor may any person register in advance a trademark that has already been used by another party and has already gained a sufficient degree of reputation through such partys use. After receiving an application, the PRC Trademark Office will make a public announcement if the relevant trademark passes the preliminary examination. During the three months after this public announcement, any person entitled to prior rights and any interested party may file an objection against the trademark. The PRC Trademark Offices decisions on rejection, objection, or cancellation of an application may be appealed to the PRC Trademark Review and Adjudication Board, whose decision may be further appealed through judicial proceedings. If no objection is filed within three months after the public announcement or if the objection has been overruled, the PRC Trademark Office will approve the registration and issue a registration certificate, at which point the trademark is deemed to be registered and will be effective for a renewable 10-year period, unless otherwise revoked.

Besides, the MIIT is in charge of the administration of PRC internet domain names. The domain name registration follows a first-to-file principle. Applicants for registration of domain names shall provide true, accurate, and complete information of their identities to domain name registration service institutions. In accordance with the Notice from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on Regulating the Use of Domain Names in Internet Information Services, which was promulgated by the MIIT on November 27, 2017 and came into effect on January 1, 2018, Internet access service providers shall verify the identity of each Internet information service provider, and shall not provide services to any Internet information service provider which fails to provide real identity information. The applicant will become the holder of such domain names upon completion of the registration procedure. As of July 31, 2020, we had completed registration of five domain names, ipoex.com, chinacnnm.com, atifchina.com, atifus.com, and dpoex.com, in the PRC and became the legal holder of such domain names.\nCopyrights\nIn accordance with the Copyright Law of the PRC promulgated by the SCNPC on September 7, 1990, last amended on Nov 11,2020, and came into effect on June 1, 2021, Chinese citizens, legal persons, or other entities own the copyright in their works whether published or not, including written works, oral works, music, comedy, arts of talking and singing, dance and acrobatics, work of art and architecture work, photographic works, cinematographic work and work created by the method similar to the film production method, engineering design drawing, product design drawing, map, sketch and other graphic works and model works, computer software, and other works specified by laws and administrative regulations. The rights a copyright owner has include but not limited to the following rights of the person and property rights: the right of publication, right of authorship, right of modification, right of integrity, right of reproduction, distribution right, rental right, right of network communication, translation right, and right of compilation.\nIn accordance with the Regulations on the Protection of Computer Software promulgated by the State Council on December 20, 2001 and last amended on January 30, 2013, Chinese citizens, legal persons, or other entities own the copyright, including the right of publication, right of authorship, right of modification, right of reproduction, distribution right, rental right, right of network communication, translation right, and other rights software copyright owners shall have in software developed by them, regardless of whether the software has been published. In accordance with the Measures for the Registration of Computer Software Copyright promulgated by the National Copyright Administration on April 6, 1992 and last amended on February 20, 2002, software copyrights, exclusive licensing contracts for software copyrights, and software copyright transfer contracts shall be registered, and the National Copyright Administration shall be the competent authority for the administration of software copyright registration and the Copyright Protection Center of China is designated as a software registration authority. The Copyright Protection Center of China shall grant a registration certification to a computer software copyright applicant who complies with relevant regulations.\nRegulations on Patents\nPursuant to the Patent Law of the PRC, or the Patent Law, promulgated by the SCNPC on March 12, 1984, most recently amended on October 17, 2020, and effective from June 1, 2021, and the Implementation Rules of the Patent Law of the PRC, promulgated by the State Council on June 15, 2001 and most recently amended on January 9, 2010, there are three types of patents in the PRC: invention patent, utility model patent, and design patent. The protection period is 20 years for invention patent and 10 years for utility model patent and 15 years for design patent, commencing from their respective application dates. Any individual or entity that utilizes a patent or conducts any other activity in infringement of a patent without prior authorization of the patentee shall pay compensation to the patentee and is subject to a fine imposed by relevant administrative authorities and, if the infringement constitutes a crime, shall be held criminally liable. In the event that a patent is owned by two or more co-owners without an agreement regarding the distribution of revenue generated from the exploitation of any co-owner of the patent, such revenue shall be distributed among all the co-owners.\nExisting patents can become narrowed, invalid, or unenforceable due to a variety of grounds, including lack of novelty, creativity, and deficiencies in patent application. In China, a patent must have novelty, creativity, and practical applicability. Under the Patent Law, novelty means that before a patent application is filed, no identical invention or utility model has been publicly disclosed in any publication in China or overseas or has been publicly used or made known to the public by any other means, whether in or outside of China, nor has any other person filed with the patent authority an application that describes an identical invention or utility model and is recorded in patent application documents or patent documents published after the filing date. Creativity means that, compared with existing technology, an invention has prominent substantial features and represents notable progress, and a utility model has substantial features and represents any progress. Practical applicability means an invention or utility model can be manufactured or used and may produce positive results. Patents in China are filed with the State Intellectual Property Office, or the SIPO. Normally, the SIPO publishes an application for an invention patent within 18 months after the filing date, which may be shortened at the request of applicant. The applicant must apply to the SIPO for a substantive examination within three years from the date of application.\nPRC Laws and Regulations Relating to Merger and Acquisition\nThe Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, adopted by six PRC regulatory agencies in August 2006 and amended in 2009, requires a foreign investor to obtain necessary approvals when engaged in certain forms of acquisition of a domestic enterprise and further requires an overseas special purpose vehicle formed for listing purposes through acquisitions of PRC domestic companies and controlled by PRC companies or individuals to obtain the approval of the CSRC, prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicles securities on an overseas stock exchange. In September 2006, the CSRC published a notice on its official website specifying documents and materials required to be submitted to it by a special purpose vehicle seeking CSRC approval of its overseas listings. Pursuant to the Manual of Guidance on Administration for Foreign Investment Access, which was issued and became effective on December 18, 2008 by MOFCOM, notwithstanding the fact that (i) the domestic shareholder is connected with the foreign investor or not, or (ii) the foreign investor is the existing shareholder or the new investor, the M&A Rules shall not apply to the transfer of an equity interest in an incorporated foreign-invested enterprise from the domestic shareholder to the foreign investor. However, the application of the M&A Rules remains unclear.\nOur PRC counsel, Dentons Law Firm, has advised us based on their understanding of the current PRC laws, rules, and regulations that the CSRCs approval should not be required for the listing and trading of our ordinary shares on the NASDAQ in the context of our IPO, given that: (i) we established our PRC subsidiary, Huaya, by means of direct investment rather than by merger with or acquisition of PRC domestic companies; and (ii) no explicit provision in the M&A Rules classifies the respective contractual arrangements between Huaya, Qianhai, and its shareholders as a type of acquisition transaction falling under the M&A Rules.\nHowever, there remains some uncertainty as to how the M&A Rules will be interpreted or implemented in the context of an overseas offering and the CSRCs opinions summarized above are subject to any new laws, rules, and regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations in any form relating to the M&A Rules. We cannot assure you that relevant PRC government agencies, including the CSRC, would reach the same conclusion as we do. If the CSRC or any other PRC regulatory agencies subsequently determines that we need to obtain the CSRCs approval for our IPO or if the CSRC or any other PRC government agencies promulgates any interpretation or implements rules that would require us to obtain CSRC or other governmental approvals for our IPO, we may face adverse actions or sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies. Sanctions may include fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limitations on our operating privileges in the PRC, delays in or restrictions on the repatriation of the proceeds from our IPO into the PRC, restrictions on or prohibition of the payments or remittance of dividends by our PRC subsidiary, or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation, and prospects, as well as the trading price of our ordinary shares. In addition, if the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies later promulgate new rules or explanations requiring that we obtain their approvals for our IPO, we may be unable to obtain a waiver of such approval requirements, if and when procedures are established to obtain such a waiver. Any uncertainties and/or negative publicity regarding such approval requirement could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of ordinary shares.\nPRC Laws and Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange\nGeneral administration of foreign exchange\nThe principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in the PRC is the Administrative Regulations of the PRC on Foreign Exchange (the Foreign Exchange Regulations), which were promulgated on January 29, 1996, became effective on April 1, 1996, and were amended on January 14, 1997, and August 1, 2008. Under these rules, RMB is generally freely convertible for payments of current account items, such as trade- and service-related foreign exchange transactions and dividend payments, but not freely convertible for capital account items, such as capital transfer, direct investment, investment in securities, derivative products, or loans unless prior approval and prior registration by competent authorities for the administration of foreign exchange is obtained and made. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC may purchase foreign exchange under the current accounts without the approval of SAFE to pay dividends by providing certain evidentiary documents, including board resolutions, tax certificates, or for trade- and services-related foreign exchange transactions, by providing commercial documents evidencing such transactions.\nCircular No. 75, Circular No. 37, and Circular No. 13\nCircular 37 was released by SAFE on July 4, 2014, and abolished Circular 75 which had been in effect since November 1, 2005. Pursuant to Circular 37, a PRC resident should apply to SAFE for foreign exchange registration of overseas investments prior to the establishment or control of an offshore special purpose vehicle, or SPV, using his or her legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests. SPVs are offshore enterprises directly established or indirectly controlled by domestic residents for the purpose of investment and financing by utilizing domestic or offshore assets or interests they legally hold. Following any significant change in a registered offshore SPV, such as capital increase, reduction, equity transfer or swap, consolidation or division involving domestic resident individuals, the domestic individuals shall amend the registration with SAFE. Where an SPV intends to repatriate funds raised after completion of offshore financing to the PRC, it shall comply with relevant PRC regulations on foreign investment and foreign debt management. A foreign-invested enterprise established through return investment shall complete relevant foreign exchange registration formalities in accordance with the prevailing foreign exchange administration regulations on foreign direct investment and truthfully disclose information on the actual controller of its shareholders.\nIf any shareholder who is a PRC resident (as determined by Circular 37) holds any interest in an offshore SPV and fails to fulfil the required foreign exchange registration with the local SAFE branches, the PRC subsidiaries of that offshore SPV may be prohibited from distributing their profits and dividends to their offshore parent company or from carrying out other subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities. The offshore SPV may also be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries. Where a domestic resident fails to complete relevant foreign exchange registration as required, fails to truthfully disclose information on the actual controller of the enterprise involved in the return investment or otherwise makes false statements, the foreign exchange control authority may order them to take remedial actions, issue a warning, and impose a fine of less than RMB300,000 (approximately $43,000) on an institution or less than RMB50,000 (approximately $7,300) on an individual.\nCircular 13 was issued by SAFE on February 13, 2015, and became effective on June 1, 2015. Pursuant to Circular 13, a domestic resident who makes a capital contribution to an SPV using his or her legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests is no longer required to apply to SAFE for foreign exchange registration of his or her overseas investments. Instead, he or she shall register with a bank in the place where the assets or interests of the domestic enterprise in which he or she has interests are located if the domestic resident individually seeks to make a capital contribution to the SPV using his or her legitimate domestic assets or interests; or he or she shall register with a local bank at his or her permanent residence if the domestic resident individually seeks to make a capital contribution to the SPV using his or her legitimate offshore assets or interests. The qualified bank will directly examine the applications and accept registrations under the supervision of SAFE.\nAs of the date of this annual report, our shareholders have not completed registrations in accordance with Circular 37, they are currently working on their registrations in the local Administration of Exchange Control. The failure of our shareholders to comply with the registration procedures may subject each of our shareholders to warnings and fines. If the registration formalities cannot be processed retrospectively, then the repatriation of the financing funds, profits, or any other interests of our shareholders obtained through special purpose vehicles, for use in China, would be prohibited. As a result, any cross-border capital flows between our PRC subsidiary and its offshore parent company, including dividend distributions and capital contributions, would be illegal\nCircular 19 and Circular 16\nCircular 19 was promulgated by SAFE on March 30, 2015, and became effective on June 1, 2015. According to Circular 19, foreign exchange capital of foreign-invested enterprises shall be granted the benefits of Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement (Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement). With Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement, foreign exchange capital in the capital account of a foreign-invested enterprise for which the rights and interests of monetary contribution has been confirmed by the local foreign exchange bureau, or for which book-entry registration of monetary contribution has been completed by the bank, can be settled at the bank based on the actual operational needs of the foreign-invested enterprise. The allowed Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement percentage of the foreign exchange capital of a foreign-invested enterprise has been temporarily set to be 100%. The RMB converted from the foreign exchange capital will be kept in a designated account and if a foreign-invested enterprise needs to make any further payment from such account, it will still need to provide supporting documents and to complete the review process with its bank.\nFurthermore, Circular 19 stipulates that foreign-invested enterprises shall make bona fide use of their capital for their own needs within their business scopes. The capital of a foreign-invested enterprise and the RMB if obtained from foreign exchange settlement shall not be used for the following purposes\n\u25cf directly or indirectly used for expenses beyond its business scope or prohibited by relevant laws or regulations;\n\u25cf directly or indirectly used for investment in securities unless otherwise provided by relevant laws or regulations;\n\u25cf directly or indirectly used for entrusted loan in RMB (unless within its permitted scope of business), repayment of inter-company loans (including advances by a third party) or repayment of bank loans in RMB that have been sub-lent to a third party; and\n\u25cf directly or indirectly used for expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use (except for foreign-invested real estate enterprises).\nCircular 16 was issued by SAFE on June 9, 2016. Pursuant to Circular 16, enterprises registered in the PRC may also convert their foreign debts from foreign currency to RMB on a self-discretionary basis. Circular 16 provides an integrated standard for conversion of foreign exchange capital items (including but not limited to foreign currency capital and foreign debts) on a self-discretionary basis applicable to all enterprises registered in the PRC. Circular 16 reiterates the principle that an enterprises RMB converted from foreign currency-denominated capital may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes beyond its business scope or purposes prohibited by PRC laws or regulations, and such converted RMB shall not be provided as loans to non-affiliated entities.\nCirculars 16 and 19 address foreign direct investments into the PRC, and stipulate the procedures applicable to foreign exchange settlement. As we do not plan to transfer any proceeds raised to our subsidiaries in the PRC, such proceeds would not be subject to Circular 19 or Circular 16. However, if and when circumstances require funds to be transferred to our subsidiaries in the PRC from our offshore entities, then any such transfer would be subject to Circulars 16 and 19.\nPRC Laws and Regulations Relating to Taxation\nEnterprise Income Tax\nThe EIT Law was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress on March 16, 2007, and became effective on January 1, 2008, and then amended on February 24, 2017 as well as December 29, 2018. The Implementation Rules of the EIT Law (the Implementation Rules) were promulgated by the State Council on December 6, 2007, and became effective on January 1, 2008, and was amended on April 23, 2019. According to the EIT Law and the Implementation Rules, enterprises are divided into resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises. Resident enterprises shall pay enterprise income tax on their incomes obtained in and outside the PRC at the rate of 25%. Non-resident enterprises setting up institutions in the PRC shall pay enterprise income tax on the incomes obtained by such institutions in and outside the PRC at the rate of 25%. Non-resident enterprises with no institutions in the PRC, and non-resident enterprises whose incomes having no substantial connection with their institutions in the PRC, shall pay enterprise income tax on their incomes obtained in the PRC at a reduced rate of 10%. An enterprise established outside of the PRC with its de facto management bodies located within the PRC is considered a resident enterprise, meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a PRC domestic enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The Implementing Rules of the EIT Law define a de facto management body as a managing body that in practice exercises substantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties of the enterprise. It is more likely than not that the Company and its offshore subsidiary would be treated as a non-resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes.\nThe Arrangement between the Mainland China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax Evasion on Income (the Arrangement) was promulgated by the State Administration of Taxation (SAT) on August 21, 2006, and came into effect on December 8, 2006. According to the Arrangement, a company incorporated in Hong Kong will be subject to withholding tax at the lower rate of 5% on dividends it receives from a company incorporated in the PRC if it holds a 25% interest or more in the PRC company. Pursuant to the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Relating to Beneficial Owner in Tax Treaties promulgated by SAT on February 3, 2018 and became effective on April 1, 2018, a beneficial ownership analysis will be applied in light of the actual circumstances of the specific cases to determine the status of a beneficial owner under the relevant tax treaty and whether or not to grant tax treaty benefits.\nBefore May 31,2022, Huaya is a resident enterprise and qualifies as a Small and Low Profit Enterprise and pays EIT tax at the rate of 10% in PRC. It is more likely than not that we and our offshore subsidiary would be treated as a non-resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes.\nValue-added Tax\nThe Provisional Regulations on Value-Added Tax of the PRC (the VAT Regulations) were promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993, and took effect on January 1, 1994, which were last amended on November 19, 2017. The Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Value Added Tax of the PRC (the Rules) were promulgated by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on December 25, 1993, and were last amended on October 28, 2011. Pursuant to the VAT Regulations and the Rules, entities or individuals in the PRC engaged in the sale of goods, the provision of processing, repairs, and replacement services and the importation of goods are required to pay VAT, on the value added during the course of the sale of goods or provision of services. Unless otherwise specified, the applicable VAT rate is 17% for taxpayers selling goods, labor services, or tangible movable property leasing services or importing goods, except otherwise specified; 11% for taxpayers selling transport services, postal services, basic telecommunications services, construction services, or real property leasing services, selling real property, transferring the land use right, or selling or importing the goods within specified scope listed, except otherwise specified; 6% for taxpayers selling services or intangible assets and not falling within the scope as specified in other items; and 3% for small-scale taxpayers.\nThe SAT and the MOF jointly promulgated Notice on Implementing the Pilot Program of Replacing Business Tax with Value-Added Tax in an All-round Manner (the Notice) on March 20, 2019, which became effective on April 1, 2019. Pursuant to this new circular, entities and individuals shall pay VAT at a rate of 9 % for providing transportation, postal services, basic telecommunications, construction or immovable property leasing services, selling any immovable property, or transferring the right to use land; rate of 13% for providing tangible movable property leasing services; rate of 0% for a cross-border taxable act within the territory of China and rate of 6% for conducting any taxable act other than the above-mentioned taxable acts.\nAccording to the above-regulations, our PRC subsidiary is generally subject to a 3% VAT rate.\nAdditional Taxes\nBefore September 1, 2021, the Provisional Regulations of the Peoples Republic of China on Urban Maintenance and Construction Tax, or the Provisional Regulations, promulgated by the State Council on February 8, 1985 and revised on January 8, 2011 governs the payment of urban maintenance and construction tax. According to the Provisional Regulations, all units and individuals paying consumption tax, VAT, and business tax are taxpayers of urban maintenance and construction tax, and shall pay urban maintenance and construction tax in accordance with the provisions of these regulations. The Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress passed the Tax Law of the Peoples Republic of China on Urban Maintenance and Construction on August 11, 2020, which became effective after September 1, 2021. According to this law, the urban maintenance and construction tax is based on VAT and consumption tax actually paid by taxpayers. Therefore, if VAT is exempted, urban construction tax will also be exempted.\nThe Interim Provisions on Levying Educational Surcharges, or the Interim Provisions, was issued by the State Council on April 28, 1986 and revised on June 7, 1990, August 20, 2005, and January 8, 2011. According to the Interim Provisions, the educational surcharges shall be calculated and levied on the basis of the actual VAT, business tax, and consumption tax paid by various units and individuals. The education surcharges rate is 3%, which shall be paid at the same time as the VAT, business tax, and consumption tax.\nThe Notice on Expanding the Exemption Scope of Relevant Government Funds, or The Notice, was issued by the MOF and the SAT on January 29, 2016 and implemented from February 1, 2016. According to The Notice, with the approval of the State Council, the scope of exemption from education surcharges, local education surcharges, and water conservancy construction funds shall be expanded from the payers whose monthly sales volume or turnover does not exceed RMB30,000 (quarterly sales or turnover paid on a quarterly basis shall not exceed RMB90,000) to RMB100,000 (quarterly sales or turnover paid on a quarterly basis shall not exceed RMB300,000).\nDividend Withholding Tax\nThe Enterprise Income Tax Law and the Implementation Rules provides that since January 1, 2008, an income tax rate of 10% will normally be applicable to dividends declared to non-PRC resident investors which do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or which have such establishment or place of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC.\nPursuant to an Arrangement Between the Mainland of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Incomes (Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement) and other applicable PRC laws, if a Hong Kong resident enterprise is determined by the competent PRC tax authority to have satisfied the relevant conditions and requirements under such Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement and other applicable laws, the 10% withholding tax on the dividends the Hong Kong resident enterprise receives from a PRC resident enterprise may be reduced to 5%. However, based on the Circular on Certain Issues with Respect to the Enforcement of Dividend Provisions in Tax Treaties (the SAT Circular 81) issued on February 20, 2009, by SAT, if the relevant PRC tax authorities determine, in their discretion, that a company benefits from such reduced income tax rate due to a structure or arrangement that is primarily tax-driven, such PRC tax authorities may adjust the preferential tax treatment. According to the Circular on Several Questions regarding the Beneficial Owner in Tax Treaties, which was issued on February 3, 2018, by the SAT and took effect on April 1, 2018, when determining the applicants status of the beneficial owner regarding tax treatments in connection with dividends, interests or royalties in the tax treaties, several factors, including without limitation, whether the applicant is obligated to pay more than 50% of his or her income in 12 months to residents in a third country or region, whether the business operated by the applicant constitutes the actual business activities, and whether the counterparty country or region to the tax treaties does not levy any tax or grant tax exemption on relevant incomes or levy tax at an extremely low rate, will be taken into account, and it will be analyzed according to the actual circumstances of the specific cases. This circular further provides that applicants who intend to prove his or her status of the beneficial owner shall submit the relevant documents to the relevant tax bureau according to the Announcement on Issuing the Measures for the Administration of Non-Resident Taxpayers Enjoyment of the Treatment under Tax Agreements.\nWe have not commenced the application process for a Hong Kong tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority, and there is no assurance that we will be granted such a Hong Kong tax resident certificate. We also have not filed required forms or materials with the relevant PRC tax authorities to prove that we should enjoy the 5% PRC withholding tax rate.\nPRC Laws and Regulations Relating to Employment and Social Welfare\nLabor Law of the PRC\nPursuant to the Labor Law of the PRC, which was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the NPC on July 5, 1994, with an effective date of January 1, 1995, and was last amended on December 29, 2018, and the Labor Contract Law of the PRC, which was promulgated on June 29, 2007, became effective on January 1, 2008, and was last amended on December 28, 2012, with the amendments coming into effect on July 1, 2013, enterprises and institutions shall ensure the safety and hygiene of a workplace, strictly comply with applicable rules and standards on workplace safety and hygiene in China, and educate employees on such rules and standards. Furthermore, employers and employees shall enter into written employment contracts to establish their employment relationships. Employers are required to inform their employees about their job responsibilities, working conditions, occupational hazards, remuneration, and other matters with which the employees may be concerned. Employers shall pay remuneration to employees on time and in full accordance with the commitments set forth in their employment contracts and with the relevant PRC laws and regulations. Until May 31,2022, before we transfer all our equity interest in Huaya, Huaya has entered into written employment contracts with all its employees and performed its obligations required under the relevant PRC laws and regulations.\nSocial Insurance and Housing Fund\nAs required under the Regulation of Insurance for Labor Injury implemented on January 1, 2004, and amended in 2010, the Provisional Measures for Maternity Insurance of Employees of Corporations implemented on January 1, 1995, the Decisions on the Establishment of a Unified Program for Pension Insurance of the State Council issued on July 16, 1997, the Decisions on the Establishment of the Medical Insurance Program for Urban Workers of the State Council promulgated on December 14, 1998, the Unemployment Insurance Measures promulgated on January 22, 1999, the Interim Regulations Concerning the Collection and Payment of Social Insurance Premiums implemented on January 22, 1999, and the Social Insurance Law of the PRC, which was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the NPC on October 28, 2010, became effective on July 1, 2011, and last amended on December 29, 2018, employers in the PRC shall provide their employees with welfare schemes covering basic pension insurance, basic medical insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, and occupational injury insurance. Huaya has deposited the social insurance fees in full for all the employees in compliance with the relevant regulations since June 2019 to May 31,2022.\nIn accordance with the Regulations on Management of Housing Provident Fund, which were promulgated by the State Council on April 3, 1999, and last amended on March 24, 2019, employers must register at the designated administrative centers and open bank accounts for depositing employees housing funds. Employer and employee are also required to pay and deposit housing funds, with an amount no less than 5% of the monthly average salary of the employee in the preceding year in full and on time.\nHong Kong Regulations\nWe own and operate CNNM, www.chinacnnm.com, a news and media platform, in Hong Kong. The following is a summary of certain aspects of major Hong Kong laws and regulations that are or may be applicable to us.\nRegulations on Digital Media Publication, Domain Name Registration, and Advertising Services\nThere are no specific legislations governing domain name registration or digital media publication in Hong Kong.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the summary of risk factors described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You also should read the section entitled Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements above for a discussion of what types of statements are forward-looking statements, as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this report. The risk factors below do not address all the risks relating to securities, business and operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nWe have a limited operating history and are subject to the risks encountered by early-stage companies.\nWe have only been in business since November 2015. We did not generate any revenue until the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. We launched AT Consulting Center, which offers financial and advisory services to our clients in August 2018 and acquired CNNM, a media and news platform, in September 2018. As a start-up company, our business strategies and model are constantly being tested by the market and operating results, and we pursue to adjust our allocation of resources accordingly. As such, our business may be subject to significant fluctuations in operating results in terms of amounts of revenues and percentages of total with respect to the business segments.\nWe are, and expect for the foreseeable future to be, subject to all the risks and uncertainties, inherent in a new business and in an industry which is in the early stages of development in China. As a result, we must establish many functions necessary to operate a business, including expanding our managerial and administrative structure, assessing and implementing our marketing program, implementing financial systems and controls and personnel recruitment. Accordingly, you should consider our prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies with a limited operating history. These risks and challenges are, among other things:\n\u25cf we operate in an industry that is or may in the future be subject to increasing regulation by various governmental agencies in China;\n\u25cf we may require additional capital to develop and expand our operations which may not be available to us when we require it;\n\u25cf our marketing and growth strategy may not be successful;\n\u25cf our business may be subject to significant fluctuations in operating results; and\n\u25cf we may not be able to attract, retain and motivate qualified professionals.\nOur future growth will depend substantially on our ability to address these and the other risks described in this annual report. If we do not successfully address these risks, our business would be significantly harmed.\nWe have incurred net losses for the year ended July 31, 2022 and expect losses to continue in the near future.\nFor the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, we incurred a loss of $2,909,584. Our operations have been adversely affected by the effect of Covid 19. In addition, the PRC has recently issued statements that may have the effect of slowing down our business consulting services of assisting PRC companies to go public in the United States. As a result, until the PRC further clarifies its views and regulations regarding PRC companies seeking to go public in the United States, and PRC companies are comfortable with the business climate and seeking our services, we anticipate that we continue to experience losses in the future.\nWe need additional capital.\nAs at July 31, 2022, we had cash of $1,750,137. We will continue to incur costs to fund our operations and will need to raise capital for working capital until our revenues increase. As a result, we will be required to raise capital for our operations primarily through equity offerings which may dilute existing shareholders. No assurance can be given that we will be able to raise capital through equity offerings which could have a substantial dilutive effect to existing shareholders.\nIf we do not continue to satisfy the Nasdaq Capital Market continued listing requirements, our Ordinary Shares could be delisted.\nThe listing of our Ordinary Shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market is contingent on our compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Markets conditions for continued listing. On December 16, 2020, we received notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market (Nasdaq) indicating we were not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share under the Nasdaq Listing Rules. In addition, on December 17, 2020, we received notice from Nasdaq stating that because we had not yet filed our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended July 31, 2020 (the Form 20-F) by its due date, we were no longer in compliance with Listing Rule which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On December 31, 2020, we filed our Form 20-F with the SEC and on January 28,2021 Nasdaq provide us confirmation that our closing bid price traded over $1.00 for ten consecutive business days. Accordingly, we are now in compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nOn July 26, 2021, we received another notice from Nasdaq indicating we that were not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share under the Nasdaq Listing Rules. The July 26, 2021 notice indicated that it had 180 calendar days, or until January 24, 2022, to regain compliance with the Listing Rules. On August 23, 2021, we effected the Reverse Split in order to the meet the minimum bid price of $1.00, and on September 14, 2021, we received notice from Nasdaq that we were back in compliance.\nIn the future, should we fail to meet the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we may be subject to delisting by Nasdaq. In the event our Ordinary Shares are no longer listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Markets, our trading volume and share price may decrease and we may experience difficulties in raising capital which could materially affect our operations and financial results. Further, delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market could also have other negative effects, including potential loss of confidence by partners, lenders, suppliers and employees. Finally, delisting could make it harder for us to raise capital and sell securities.\nWe lost our foreign private issuer status, which could result in significant additional costs and expenses.\nThe regulatory and compliance costs under U.S. federal securities laws as a U.S. domestic issuer may be significantly more than the costs incurred as a foreign private issuer. Because we are no longer deemed to be a foreign private issuer, we are required to file periodic and current reports and registration statements on U.S. domestic issuer forms with the SEC, which are more detailed and extensive than the forms available to a foreign private issuer. In addition, we lost the ability to rely upon certain exemptions from the Nasdaq Capital Markets corporate governance requirements that are available to foreign private issuers.\nOur historical financial results may not be indicative of our future performance.\nWe may not be able to sustain our historical rapid growth and/or may not be able to grow our business at all. Our net revenue increased from $3.6 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017 and $5.3 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018. However, our net revenue decreased to $1.7 million, $0.9 million and $0.6 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our net income was $0.6 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017, $1.9 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, and $0.4 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, and decreased to a net loss of $17.3 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, and our net losses were $3.4 million and $9.0 million for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2022 respectively. However, our historical growth rate, limited history of operation, changes to business operations, among other factors, make it difficult to evaluate our prospects.\nSubstantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nBecause of our losses from operations, working capital deficit, and our requirement of additional capital to fund our current operating plan, at July 31, 2022, these factors indicate the existence of an uncertainty that raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and is dependent on our ability to raise addition working capital through debt or equity financings.\nWe may incur liability for unpaid taxes, including interest and penalties.\nIn the normal course of business, we may be subject to challenges from various PRC taxing authorities regarding the amounts of taxes due. The PRC taxing authorities may take the position that we owe more taxes than we have paid. We recorded tax liabilities of $Niland $0.1 million as of July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for the possible underpayment of income and business taxes. It is possible that our tax for past taxes may be higher than those amounts if the PRC authorities determine that we are subject to penalties or that we have not paid the correct amount. Although our management believes it may be able to negotiate with local PRC taxing authorities a reduction to any amounts that such authorities may believe are due and a reduction to any interest or penalties thereon, we have no guarantee that we will be able to negotiate such a reduction. To the extent we are able to negotiate such amounts, national-level taxing authorities may take the position that localities are without power to reduce such liabilities, and such PRC taxing authorities may attempt to collect unpaid taxes, interest and penalties in amounts greatly exceeding managements estimates.\nWe face business disruption and related risks resulting from the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which could have a material adverse effect on our business plan.\nOur financial consulting services to small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs) and the businesses of the SMEs could be disrupted and materially adversely affected by the recent outbreak of COVID-19. As a result of measures imposed by the China governments in affected regions, businesses and schools have been suspended due to quarantines intended to contain this outbreak. The spread of COVID-19 from China to other countries has resulted in the Director General of the World Health Organization declaring the outbreak of COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), based on the advice of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. issued a warning on February 25, 2020 regarding the likely spread of COVID-19 to the U.S. Even though the COVID-19 situation is now normalizing internationally, however, the Chinese government is continuing to impose strict measures which could negatively affect the Chinese economy, and has continued to contribute to the on-going slow-down of the Chinese economy. We are continuing to assess our business plans and the impact COVID-19 may have on our ability to provide financial consulting services to SMEs and to the SMEs businesses, but there can be no assurance that this analysis will enable us to avoid part or all of any impact from the spread of COVID-19 or its consequences, including downturns in business sentiment generally or in our sector in particular. In addition, no assurance can be given that there would not be a future outbreak of COVID-19 which may result in additional quarantine and other measures taken to try to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the U.S. capital markets could make our services less attractive to our clients and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur consulting services help our clients based in mainland China become public companies. We are expanding our consulting services to include Chinese domestic exchanges and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, but currently, all of our former and current clients have chosen to go public in the U.S. We believe this is due to the more flexible rules provided by the U.S. OTC markets and exchanges than the Chinese domestic exchanges, as well as the attractive financing and growth opportunities the U.S. capital market, which has remained relatively stable comparing to the Chinese capital market, are perceived to be able to provide to the Chinese enterprises. As a result, our going public consulting business has flourished since its inception in 2015. However, changes in the U.S. capital markets could make our service less desirable to Chinese enterprises. For example, if the U.S. OTC markets and exchanges make their rules more stringent to Chinese enterprises, then fewer Chinese enterprises will be able to use our consulting services to go public in the U.S., and our business and financial condition will be adversely affected as a result.\nBecause we lack a diversified client base, a severe or prolonged downturn in Chinese economy could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nOur goal is to become an international business serving clients throughout Asia, but as of the date of this annual report all our former and current clients are based in mainland China. Accordingly, we do not have a geographically diversified client base, and there will be a potentially devastating effect on our business if the Chinese economy experiences a severe or prolonged downturn.\nFailure to maintain or enhance our brand or image could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe believe our ATIF brand is associated with a well-recognized, integrated consulting services company in the market that it operates, with comprehensive personalized one-stop consulting services to suit our clients needs. Our brand is integral to our sales and marketing efforts. Our continued success in maintaining and enhancing our brand and image depends to a large extent on our ability to satisfy customers needs by further developing and maintaining quality of services across our operations, as well as our ability to respond to competitive pressures. If we are unable to satisfy customers needs or if our public image or reputation were otherwise diminished, our business transactions with our clients may decline, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in implementing important new strategic initiatives, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. Our new strategic initiatives, AT Consulting Center and CNNM, which were launched in 2018, and the investment and financing analysis reporting business, which was launched in July 2019, are designed to create growth, improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value. However, our management may lack required experience, knowledge, insight, or human and capital resources to carry out the effective implementation to expand into new spaces outside the financial consulting industry. As such, we may not be able to realize our expected growth, and our business and financial results will be adversely impacted.\nIncreasing competition within our industry could have an impact on our business prospects.\nThe financial consulting market is an industry where new competitors can easily enter into since there are no significant barriers to entry. Competing companies may have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do and may offer services that are more attractive to companies seeking funds; increased competition would have a negative impact on both our revenues and our profit margins.\nOur results of operations and cash flows may fluctuate due to the non-recurring nature of our going public consulting services provided to our clients.\nWe generated the bulk of our total revenues from going public consulting services provided to small and medium-sized enterprises in China. Unlike other service businesses that have the potential of retaining their clients for long-term and recurring services, our consulting contractual relationships with our clients usually last for 12 months; there is no recurring business from our clients once they become public companies. Therefore, we face the constant challenge of identifying and recruiting new clients in order to maintain our operations and cash flows, which are difficult for us to predict from year to year.\nIn addition, even though we screen our prospective clients carefully before entering into service agreements, occasionally we have to discontinue our consulting services due to a variety of unforeseeable reasons such as the clients shortage in funds, disagreements regarding the going public process, and changes in the clients business and expectations, among others. Due to the fact that our consulting fee is paid on installments, we will not be able to realize the complete contracted amounts under these circumstances, without getting into potentially costly litigations.\nArbitration proceedings, legal proceedings, investigations, and other claims or disputes are costly to defend and, if determined adversely to us, could require us to pay fines or damages, undertake remedial measures, or prevent us from taking certain actions, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nIn the course of our business, we are, and in the future may be, a party to arbitration proceedings, legal proceedings, investigations, and other claims or disputes, which have related and may relate to subjects including commercial transactions, intellectual property, securities, employee relations, or compliance with applicable laws and regulations. As discussed below, we are engaged in a lawsuit relating to certain engagement agreements we had in connection with our and Leaping Group Co.s initial public offering.\nOn May 14, 2020, Boustead Securities, LLC (Boustead) filed its original complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (CV-03749) against LGC and us. The case arises from a consulting agreement between us and Boustead, wherein Boustead claims that it is entitled to fees in connection with our cancellation of an $1,851,000 outstanding debt owed by LGC and issuance of 9,940,002 ordinary shares (1,988,000 ordinary shares retrospectively restated for effect of reverse stock split on August 30, 2021) to LGC in exchange for a 51.2% interest in LGC. Boustead claims that we breached that consulting agreement and is entitled to fees in connection with our acquiring control of LGC. Bousteads complaint alleges four causes of action against us including breach of contract; breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; tortious interference with business relationships and quantum meruit.\nOn October 6, 2020, we filed a motion to dismiss Bousteads Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(5). On October 9, 2020, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York directed Boustead to respond to the motion or amend its Complaint by November 10, 2020. Boustead opted to amend its complaint and filed the amended complaint on November 10, 2020. Bousteads first amended complaint asserted the same four causes of action against LGC and us as its original complaint. We filed another motion to dismiss Bousteads amended complaint on December 8, 2020.\nOn August 25, 2021, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted ATIFs motion to dismiss Bousteads first amended complaint. In its order and opinion, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York allowed Boustead to move for leave to amend its causes of action against us as to breach of contract and tortious interference with business relationships, but not breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and quantum meruit. On November 4, 2021, Boustead filed a motion seeking leave to file a second amended complaint to amend its cause of action for Breach of Contract. The Court granted Bousteads motion for leave and Boustead filed the second amended complaint on December 28, 2021 alleging only breach of contract and dropping all other causes of action alleged in the original complaint. On January 18, 2022, the Company filed a motion to dismiss Bousteads second amended complaint. Boustead filed its opposition on February 1, 2022 and the Company replied on February 8, 2022.\nOn July 6, 2022, the Court denied our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. Thereafter, on August 3, 2022, the Company filed a motion to compel arbitration of Bousteads claims in California. Briefing on the Companys motion to compel concluded on August 23, 2022. The Court has yet to rule on that motion. Boustead is also seeking a default judgment against LGC and recently filed an order to show cause for default judgment against LGC. The Court has not ruled on Bousteads request for entry of default judgment against LGC.\nIn sum, the Boustead litigation is currently in the pleadings stage. Our management believes it is premature to assess and predict the outcome of this pending litigation.\nAs the operator of a website ipoex.com, we may be subject to damages resulting from unauthorized access or hacking and other cyber risks.\nHacking is the process of attempting to gain or successfully gaining unauthorized access to computer system. As with any website, our website may be subject to hacking regardless of whether we have in place securities systems which limit access to our platform. When a person engages in website hacking, he or she takes control of the website from the website owner. Password hacking is obtaining a users secret password from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system. Computer hacking is obtaining access to and viewing, creating or editing material without authorization. Hackers can bring a website down by causing large numbers of users to seek to access the website without the knowledge of the users, which is known as denial-of-service hacking. Despite our disclaimers, injured parties may seek to obtain damages from us for their loss. Thus, in additional to any financial or reputation losses that we may sustain, it is possible that a court or administrative body may hold us liable for damages sustained by others. Any such losses could materially impair our financial condition and our ability to conduct business.\nIf we fail to hire, train, and retain qualified managerial and other employees, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe place substantial reliance on the consulting and financial service industry experience and knowledge of our senior management team as well as their relationships with other industry participants. The loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management could hinder our ability to effectively manage our business and implement our growth strategies. Finding suitable replacements for our current senior management could be difficult, and competition for such personnel of similar experience is intense. If we fail to retain our senior management, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur consulting service personnel are critical to maintaining the quality and consistency of our services, brand, and reputation. It is important for us to attract qualified managerial and other employees who have experience in consulting services and are committed to our service approach. There may be a limited supply of such qualified individuals. We must hire and train qualified managerial and other employees on a timely basis to keep pace with our rapid growth while maintaining consistent quality of services across our operations. We must also provide continuous training to our managerial and other employees so that they are equipped with up-to-date knowledge of various aspects of our operations and can meet our demand for high-quality services. If we fail to do so, the quality of our services may decrease, which in turn, may cause a negative perception of our brand and adversely affect our business.\nAny failure to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe believe our trademarks, \u4e9e\u6d32\u6642\u4ee3 in Hong Kong, ATIF in Hong Kong and China, \u4e9a\u6d32\u65f6\u4ee3 in China, CNNM in Hong Kong INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL OF FINANCE in Hong Kong, IPOEX in China, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Singapore, and is also in the process of registration with the trademark office of Korea, and other intellectual property rights are critical to our success. Any unauthorized use of our trademarks and other intellectual property rights could harm our competitive advantages and business. Historically, China has not protected intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States, and infringement of intellectual property rights continues to pose a serious risk of doing business in China. Monitoring and preventing unauthorized use are difficult. The measures we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate. Furthermore, the application of laws governing intellectual property rights in China and abroad is uncertain and evolving, and could involve substantial risks to us. If we are unable to adequately protect our brand, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, we may lose these rights and our business may suffer materially.\nAs internet domain name rights are not rigorously regulated or enforced in China, other companies may incorporate in their domain names elements similar in writing or pronunciation to the ATIF, CNNM, and INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL OF FINANCE, and IPOEX trademarks or their Chinese equivalents. This may result in confusion between those companies and our company and may lead to the dilution of our brand value, which could adversely affect our business.\nPoor performance of our private equity fund would cause a decline in our revenues, net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future funds.\nWhen our private equity fund performs poorly, either by incurring losses or underperforming benchmarks or our competitors, our investment record suffers. Poor investment performance by our private equity fund also adversely affects our incentive income and, all else being equal, may lead to a decline in our AUM, resulting in a reduction of our management fees. Moreover, in such circumstances, we may experience losses on our investments of our own capital. If a fund performs poorly, we will receive little or no incentive income with regard to the fund and little income or possibly losses from our own principal investment in the fund. Poor performance of our private equity fund could also make it more difficult for us to raise new capital. Investors in our private equity fund may decline to invest in future funds we raise, and investors in our private equity fund may withdraw their investments in the fund as a result of poor performance. Our investors and potential investors continually assess our funds performance, both on a standalone basis and relative to market benchmarks, our competitors, and other investment products, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future funds and avoid excessive redemption levels depends on our funds performance.\nRisks Relating to Doing Business in China\nIf we are unable to substantially comply with any PRC rules and regulations, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. The central or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof, and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties.\nAs such, our business operations of and the industries we operate in may be subject to various government and regulatory interference in the provinces in which they operate. We could be subject to regulation by various political and regulatory entities, including various local and municipal agencies and government sub-divisions. We may incur increased costs necessary to comply with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply. In the event that we are not able to substantially comply with any existing or newly adopted laws and regulations, our business operations may be materially adversely affected and the value of our ordinary shares may significantly decrease.\nFurthermore, the PRC government authorities may strengthen oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers like us. Such actions taken by the PRC government authorities may intervene or influence our operations at any time, which are beyond our control. Therefore, any such action may adversely affect our operations and significantly limit or hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to you and reduce the value of such securities.\nThe PRCs stock regulators statements regarding PRC companies seeking listing abroad, such as the United States, may adversely affect our business.\nRecently, the PRC has stated that it plans to propose new rules that would ban companies with large amounts of sensitive consumer data from going public in the U.S. which could deter PRC company tech firms to list abroad. The PRC has primarily focused on firms in the internet, telecommunications and education industry from listing abroad due to political or national-security concerns. As a result of these statements, this position by the PRC could adversely affect our business consulting services which assist PRC companies to go public in the United States.\nA severe or prolonged downturn in the global or Chinese economy could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nAlthough the Chinese economy has grown steadily in the past decade, there is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the Peoples Bank of China and financial authorities of some of the worlds leading economies, including the United States and China. There have been concerns over unrest and terrorist threats in the Middle East, Europe, and Africa, which have resulted in volatility in oil and other markets. There have also been concerns on the relationship among China and other Asian countries, which may result in or intensify potential conflicts in relation to territorial disputes. Economic conditions in China are sensitive to global economic conditions, as well as changes in domestic economic and political policies and the expected or perceived overall economic growth rate in China. Any severe or prolonged slowdown in the global or Chinese economy may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe recent state government interference into business activities on U.S. listed Chinese companies may negatively impact our existing and future operations in China.\nRecently, the Chinese government announced that it would step up supervision of Chinese companies listed offshore. Under the new measures, China will improve regulation of cross-border data flows and security, crack down on illegal activity in the securities market and punish fraudulent securities issuance, market manipulation and insider trading, China will also check sources of funding for securities investment and control leverage ratios. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has also opened a cybersecurity probe into several U.S.-listed tech giants focusing on anti-monopoly, financial technology regulation and more recently, with the passage of the Data Security Law, how companies collect, store, process and transfer data.\nWe are headquartered and have operations in China. We currently do not, and we do not plan to use variable interest entities to execute our business plan or to conduct our China-based operations. However, because we have operations in China, there is always a risk that the Chinese government may in the future seek to intervene or influence operations of any company with any level of operations in China, including its ability to offer securities to investors, list its securities on a U.S. or other foreign exchange, conduct its business or accept foreign investment. In light of Chinas recent announcements, there are risks and uncertainties which we cannot foresee for the time being, and rules and regulations in China can change quickly with little or no advance notice. The Chinese government may intervene or influence the Companys current and future operations in China at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in issuers likes ourselves.\nIf any or all of the foregoing were to occur, this could lead to a material change in our operations and/or the value of its common stock and/or significantly limit or completely hinder its ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.\nIncreases in labor costs in the PRC may adversely affect our business and our profitability.\nChinas economy has experienced increases in labor costs in recent years. Chinas overall economy and the average wages in China are expected to continue to grow. The average wage level for our employees has also increased in recent years. We expect that our labor costs, including wages and employee benefits, will continue to increase. Our consulting service is heavy on labor costs, as the main cost of our business is compensation and benefits for our professionals. Unless we are able to pass on these increased labor costs to our customers by increasing prices for our services, our profitability and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, we have been subject to stricter regulatory requirements in terms of entering into labor contracts with our employees and paying various statutory employee benefits, including pensions, housing fund, medical insurance, work-related injury insurance, unemployment insurance and maternity insurance to designated government agencies for the benefit of our employees. Pursuant to the PRC Labor Contract Law, or the Labor Contract Law, that became effective in January 2008, its implementing rules that became effective in September 2008 and its amendments that became effective in July 2013, employers are subject to stricter requirements in terms of signing labor contracts, minimum wages, paying remuneration, determining the term of employees probation and unilaterally terminating labor contracts. In the event that we decide to terminate some of our employees or otherwise change our employment or labor practices, the Labor Contract Law and its implementing rules may limit our ability to effect those changes in a desirable or cost-effective manner, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs the interpretation and implementation of labor-related laws and regulations are still evolving, we cannot assure you that our employment practice does not and will not violate labor-related laws and regulations in China, which may subject us to labor disputes or government investigations. If we are deemed to have violated relevant labor laws and regulations, we could be required to provide additional compensation to our employees and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nSubstantial uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation and implementation of any new PRC laws, rules and regulations relating to foreign investment and how it may impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and our business operations.\nOn March 15, 2019, the Standing Committee of National Peoples Congress promulgated the Foreign Investment Law, which came into effect on January 1, 2020 and replaced the three existing laws regulating foreign investment in China, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The existing foreign-invested enterprises, or FIEs, established prior to the effectiveness of the Foreign Investment Law may keep their corporate forms within five years. The Foreign Investment Law stipulates that China implements the management system of pre-establishment national treatment plus a negative list to foreign investment, and the government generally will not expropriate foreign investment, except under certain special circumstances, in which case it will provide fair and reasonable compensation to foreign investors. Foreign investors are barred from investing in prohibited industries on the negative list and must comply with the specified requirements when investing in restricted industries on such list. On December 26, 2019, the State Council promulgated the Implementing Regulations of the Foreign Investment Law, which came into effect on January 1, 2020 and further requires that FIEs and domestic enterprises be treated equally with respect to policy making and implementation.\nPursuant to the Foreign Investment Law, foreign investment means any foreign investors direct or indirect investment in the PRC, including: (i) establishing FIEs in the PRC either individually or jointly with other investors; (ii) obtaining stock shares, stock equity, property shares, other similar interests in Chinese domestic enterprises; (iii) investing in new project in the PRC either individually or jointly with other investors; and (iv) making investment through other means provided by laws, administrative regulations or State Council provisions. Although the Foreign Investment Law does not explicitly classify the contractual arrangements, as a form of foreign investment, it contains a catch-all provision under the definition of foreign investment, which includes investments made by foreign investors in China through other means stipulated by laws or administrative regulations or other methods prescribed by the State Council without elaboration on the meaning of other means. However, the Implementing Regulations of the Foreign Investment Law still does not specify whether foreign investment includes contractual arrangements.\nChanges in Chinas economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAll of our manufacturing operations are located in China. Accordingly, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced to a significant degree by political, economic and social conditions in China generally and by continued economic growth in China as a whole.\nThe Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the amount of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the government. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies and change of enforcement practice of such rules and policies can change quickly with little advance notice.\nWhile the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. Since 2012, Chinas economic growth has slowed down. Any prolonged slowdown in the Chinese economy may reduce the demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nUncertainties and quick change in the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations with little advance notice could result in a material and negative impact our business operation, decrease the value of our ordinary shares and limit the legal protections available to us.\nThe PRC legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions have limited value as precedents. Since these laws and regulations are relatively new and the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involves uncertainties. The enforcement of laws and that rules and regulations in China can change quickly with little advance notice and the risk that the Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China- based issuers, could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our ordinary shares.\nWe cannot rule out the possibility that the PRC government will institute a licensing regime or pre-approval requirement covering our industry at some point in the future. If such a licensing regime or approval requirement were introduced, we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain any newly required license in a timely manner, or at all, which could materially and adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operations.\nFrom time to time, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights. However, since PRC administrative and court authorities have some discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, it may be difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings. Furthermore, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published in a timely manner or at all) that may have retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. Such uncertainties, including uncertainty over the scope and effect of our contractual, property (including intellectual property) and procedural rights, could materially and adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operations.\nWe are not in compliance with the PRCs regulations relating to offshore investment activities by PRC residents, and as a result, we and our shareholders may be subject to severe penalties if we are not able to remediate the non-compliance.\nIn July 2014, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration Over the Overseas Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment by Domestic Residents Via Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 37, which replaced Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents Corporate Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 75. Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, referred to in Circular 37 as a special purpose vehicle for the purpose of holding domestic or offshore assets or interests. Circular 37 further requires amendment to a PRC residents registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as an increase or decrease in the capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. Under these regulations, PRC residents failure to comply with specified registration procedures may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant PRC entity, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent, as well as restrictions on capital inflows from the offshore entity to the PRC entity, including restrictions on its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries. Further, failure to comply with the SAFE registration requirements could result in penalties under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange regulations.\nWe have requested our shareholders who are Chinese residents to make the necessary applications, filings, and amendments as required under Circular 37 and other related rules. However, we cannot provide any assurances that all of our shareholders who are Chinese residents will comply with our request to make or obtain any applicable registration. Any failure by any of our shareholders who is a PRC resident, or is controlled by a PRC resident, to comply with relevant requirements under these regulations could subject us to fines or sanctions imposed by the PRC government, including restrictions on Huayas ability to pay dividends or make distributions to us and on our ability to increase our investment in Huaya. However, we have transferred all our equity interest in Huaya on May 31,2022 and since then, we shall not be affected by the above restrictions.\nWe are not in compliance with the PRCs regulations relating to employees housing funds, and as a result, we and our shareholders may be subject to penalties if we are not able to remediate the non-compliance.\nIn accordance with the Regulations on Management of Housing Provident Fund (the Regulations of HPF), which were promulgated by the PRC State Council on April 3, 1999, and last amended on March 24, 2002, employers must register at the designated administrative centers and open bank accounts for employees housing funds deposits. Employers and employees are also required to pay and deposit housing funds, in an amount no less than 5% of the monthly average salary of each of the employees in the preceding year in full and on time. Huaya has registered at the designated administrative centers and opened bank accounts for its employees housing funds deposits. However, Huaya has not deposited the housing funds for all the employees with an amount no less than 5% of the monthly average salary of the employee in compliance with the relevant regulations since June 2019 to May 31,2022, which might subject us to pay and deposit housing funds in full and on time within the prescribed time limit by relevant authorities. If we fail to do so, relevant authorities could file applications to competent courts for compulsory enforcement of payment and deposit. Since May 31,2022, all our equity interest in Huaya has been transferred, and we will not be liable to pay and deposit housing funds for its employees.\nBecause our business is conducted in RMB and the price of our Ordinary Shares is quoted in U.S. dollars, changes in currency conversion rates may affect the value of your investments.\nWe currently cooperate with Huaya to expand our business in the PRC, our books and records are maintained in RMB, which is the currency of the PRC, and the financial statements that we file with the SEC and provide to our shareholders are presented in U.S. dollars. Changes in the exchange rate between the RMB and U.S. dollar affect the value of our assets and the results of our operations in U.S. dollars. The value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in the PRCs political and economic conditions and perceived changes in the economy of the PRC and the United States. Any significant revaluation of the RMB may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenue, and financial condition.\nUnder the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, we may be classified as a resident enterprise of China, which could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders.\nThe EIT Law and its implementing rules provide that enterprises established outside of China whose de facto management bodies are located in China are considered resident enterprises under PRC tax laws. The implementing rules promulgated under the EIT Law define the term de facto management bodies as a management body which substantially manages, or has control over the business, personnel, finance and assets of an enterprise. In April 2009, the State Administration of Taxation, or SAT, issued a notice, known as SAT Notice 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether a PRC-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having a de facto management body in China. However, there are no further detailed rules or precedents governing the procedures and specific criteria for determining de facto management body. Although our board of directors and management are located in the PRC, it is unclear if the PRC tax authorities would determine that we should be classified as a PRC resident enterprise.\nIf we are deemed as a PRC resident enterprise, we will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on our worldwide income at a uniform tax rate of 25%, although dividends distributed to us from our existing PRC subsidiary and any other PRC subsidiaries which we may establish from time to time could be exempt from the PRC dividend withholding tax due to our PRC resident recipient status. This could have a material and adverse effect on our overall effective tax rate, our income tax expenses, and our net income. Furthermore, dividends, if any, paid to our shareholders may be decreased as a result of the decrease in distributable profits. In addition, if we were considered a PRC resident enterprise, any dividends we pay to our non-PRC investors, and the gains realized from the transfer of our Ordinary Shares may be considered income derived from sources within the PRC and be subject to PRC tax, at a rate of 10% in the case of non-PRC enterprises or 20% in the case of non-PRC individuals (in each case, subject to the provisions of any applicable tax treaty). It is unclear whether holders of our Ordinary Shares would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise. This could have a material and adverse effect on the value of your investment in us and the price of our Ordinary Shares.\nThere are significant uncertainties under the EIT Law relating to the withholding tax liabilities of our PRC subsidiary, and dividends payable by our PRC subsidiary to our offshore subsidiaries may not qualify to enjoy certain treaty benefits.\nUnder the EIT Law and its implementation rules, the profits of a foreign invested enterprise generated through operations, which are distributed to its immediate holding company outside the PRC, will be subject to a withholding tax rate of 10%. Pursuant to a special arrangement between Hong Kong and the PRC, such rate may be reduced to 5% if a Hong Kong resident enterprise owns more than 25% of the equity interest in the PRC company. Our PRC subsidiary is wholly-owned by our Hong Kong subsidiary. Moreover, under the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues regarding the Administration of the Dividend Provision in Tax Treaties promulgated on February 20, 2009, the tax payer needs to satisfy certain conditions to enjoy the benefits under a tax treaty. These beneficial owners of the relevant dividends and the corporate shareholder to receive dividends from the PRC subsidiary must have continuously met the direct ownership thresholds during the 12 consecutive months preceding the receipt of the dividends. Pursuant to the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Relating to Beneficial Owner in Tax Treaties promulgated by SAT on February 3, 2018 and became effective on April 1, 2018, certain detailed factors are set forth and a beneficial ownership analysis will be applied in light of the actual circumstances of the specific cases in determining the beneficial owner status under the relevant tax treaty and whether or not to grant tax treaty benefits. In current practice, a Hong Kong enterprise must obtain a tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority to apply for the 5% lower PRC withholding tax rate. As the Hong Kong tax authority will issue such a tax resident certificate on a case-by-case basis, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority. As of the date of this annual report, we have not commenced the application process for a Hong Kong tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority, and there is no assurance that we will be granted such a Hong Kong tax resident certificate.\nEven after we obtain the Hong Kong tax resident certificate, we are required by applicable tax laws and regulations to file required forms and materials with relevant PRC tax authorities to prove that we can enjoy 5% lower PRC withholding tax rate. ATIF HK intends to obtain the required materials and file with the relevant tax authorities when it plans to declare and pay dividends, but there is no assurance that the PRC tax authorities will approve the 5% withholding tax rate on dividends received from ATIF HK.\nPRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may delay or prevent us from making loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nAny funds we transfer to our PRC subsidiary, either as a shareholder loan or as an increase in registered capital, are subject to approval by or registration with relevant governmental authorities in China. According to the relevant PRC regulations on foreign-invested enterprises, or FIEs, the combined amount of offshore capital contributions and loans cannot exceed the FIEs approved total investment amount. Any capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary must be filed with MOFCOM or its local counterparts, and registered with a local bank authorized by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE. In addition, (a) any loan provided by us to WFOE, which is a FIE, cannot exceed the difference between its total investment amount and registered capital, and must be registered with SAFE or its local counterparts, and (b) any loan provided by us to our VIE which is a domestic PRC entity, over a certain threshold, must be approved by the relevant government authorities and must be registered with SAFE or its local counterparts. Given that the registered capital and total investment amount of WFOE are currently the same, if we seek to make a capital contribution to WFOE we must first apply to increase both its registered capital and total investment amount, while if we seek to provide a loan to WFOE, we must first increase its total investment amount. Although we currently do not have any immediate plans to utilize the proceeds from our initial public offering (IPO) to make capital contribution into WFOE or provide any loan to WFOE or to our VIE, if we seek to do so in the future, we may not be able to obtain the required government approvals or complete the required registrations on a timely basis, if at all. If we fail to receive such approvals or complete such registrations, our ability to use the proceeds of our IPO and to capitalize our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nOn March 30, 2015, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Reforming the Management Approach Regarding the Foreign Exchange Capital Settlement of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 19. SAFE Circular 19 launched a nationwide reform of the administration of the settlement of the foreign exchange capitals of FIEs and allows FIEs to settle their foreign exchange capital at their discretion, but continues to prohibit FIEs from using the RMB fund converted from their foreign exchange capitals for expenditure beyond their business scopes, providing entrusted loans or repaying loans between non-financial enterprises. Violations of these Circulars could result in severe monetary or other penalties. SAFE Circular 19 and relevant foreign exchange regulatory rules may significantly limit our ability to use RMB converted from the net proceeds of our IPO to fund the establishment of new entities in China by our consolidated affiliates, to invest in or acquire any other PRC companies through our PRC subsidiary or consolidated affiliates or to establish new consolidated affiliates in the PRC, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we become directly subject to the scrutiny, criticism, and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations, stock price, and reputation.\nU.S. public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism, and negative publicity by investors, financial commentators, and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism, and negative publicity has centered on financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto, and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the scrutiny, criticism, and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies sharply decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits and SEC enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect this sector-wide scrutiny, criticism, and negative publicity will have on us, our business, and our stock price. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend our company. This situation will be costly and time consuming and distract our management from growing our business. If such allegations are not proven to be groundless, we and our business operations will be severely affected and you could sustain a significant decline in the value of our stock.\nIf the Chinese government were to impose new requirements for permission or approval from the PRC Authorities including China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) or CAC, or any other entity that is required to approve this offering, to issue our ordinary shares to foreign investors or list on a foreign exchange, such action could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.\nOur PRC counsel, Dentons Law Firm, has advised us based on their understanding of the current PRC laws, rules, and regulations that as of the date of this prospectus, we and our PRC subsidiaries, (1) are not required to obtain permissions from any PRC authorities to operate or issue our Ordinary Shares to foreign investors, (2) are not subject to permission requirements from the CSRC, CAC or any other entity that is required to approve of our PRC subsidiaries operations, and (3) have not received or were denied such permissions by any PRC authorities. Nevertheless, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the Opinions on Severely Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities According to Law, or the Opinions, which were made available to the public on July 6, 2021. The Opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities, and the need to strengthen the supervision over overseas listings by Chinese companies. On November 16, 2021, thirteen departments including Cyberspace Administration of China,the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of Commerce jointly promulgated the Measures for Cyber Security Examination, which will be effective on February 15, 2022. The Measures for Cyber Security Examination include data processing activities of network platform operators that affect or may affect national security into cyber security review, and make it clear that network platform operators with personal information of more than one million users must apply for cyber security review to the Cyber security Review Office when they go public abroad. The CSRC issued Administrative Provisions of The State Council on Overseas Issuance and Listing of Securities by Domestic Enterprises (Draft for Public Comments) (Administrative Provisions) and Measures for the Administration of Filing overseas Issuance and Listing of Securities by Domestic Enterprises (Draft for Public Comments) (Measures) to solicit public opinions on December 24, 2021. The Administrative Provisions and Measures stipulate that no matter the domestic enterprises are directly or indirectly listed (including variable interest entities structure), the filing with CSRC management will be uniformly applied. The National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce issued the Special Administrative Measures for Foreign Investment Access (Negative List) (2021 version) (Negative List) on December 27, 2021 , which will come into force on January 1, 2022. Compared to the previous version, there arent any new specific industries added to the negative list. Given the current PRC regulatory environment, it is uncertain when and whether we or our PRC subsidiaries, will be required to obtain permission from the PRC government to list on U.S. exchanges in the future, and even when such permission is obtained, whether it will be denied or rescinded.\nFurther, since these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and list on an U.S. exchange. If, (i) we inadvertently conclude that such approvals or permissions are not required, or (ii) applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change and we are required to obtain such approvals and permissions in the future, and we are unable to obtain such approvals and permissions, Borqs will not be able to perform R&D and manufacturing in China, our revenues will be adversely affected and we will have to expand our R&D activities in India and relocate our manufacturing activities outside China to India or other Asian countries. Also, if applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change, and we are required to obtain permission or approval from the PRC authority for the offering of our Ordinary Shares in the U.S. in the future, and if any of such permission or approval were not received maintained, or subsequently rescinded, it may significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to complete this offering or cause the value of our Ordinary Shares to significantly decline or become worthless\nThe disclosures in our reports and other filings with the SEC and our other public pronouncements are not subject to the scrutiny of any regulatory bodies in the PRC.\nWe are regulated by the SEC and our reports and other filings with the SEC are subject to SEC review in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Our SEC reports and other disclosures and public pronouncements are not subject to the review or scrutiny of any PRC regulatory authority. For example, the disclosure in our SEC reports and other filings are not subject to the review by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, a PRC regulator that is responsible for oversight of the capital markets in China. Accordingly, you should review our SEC reports, filings, and our other public pronouncements with the understanding that no local regulator has done any review of us, our SEC reports, other filings or any of our other public pronouncements.\nThe failure to comply with PRC regulations relating to mergers and acquisitions of domestic entities by offshore special purpose vehicles may subject us to severe fines or penalties and create other regulatory uncertainties regarding our corporate structure.\nOn August 8, 2006, MOFCOM, joined by the CSRC, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, the SAT, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (the SAIC), and SAFE, jointly promulgated regulations entitled the Provisions Regarding Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Entities by Foreign Investors (the M&A Rules), which took effect as of September 8, 2006, and as amended on June 22, 2009. The M&A Rules stipulate that foreign investors shall comply with the M&A Rules when they purchase equity interests of a domestic company or subscribe the increased capital of a domestic company, and thus changing the nature of the domestic company into a foreign-invested enterprise, when the foreign investors establish a foreign-invested enterprise in the PRC, purchase the assets of a domestic company and operate the assets, or when the foreign investors purchase the assets of a domestic company, establish a foreign-invested enterprise by injecting such assets, and operate the assets. As for merger and acquisition of a domestic company with a related party relationship by a domestic company, enterprise or natural person in the name of an overseas company legitimately incorporated or controlled by the domestic company, enterprise of natural person, such merger and acquisition shall be subject to examination and approval of MOFCOM. The parties involved shall not use domestic investment by foreign investment enterprises or other methods to circumvent the requirement of examination and approval. These regulations, among other things, have certain provisions that require offshore special purpose vehicles formed for the purpose of acquiring PRC domestic companies and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC individuals and companies, to obtain the approval of MOFCOM prior to engaging in such acquisitions and to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock market and trading of such special purpose vehicles securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website a notice specifying the documents and materials that are required to be submitted for obtaining CSRC approval.\nThe application of the M&A Rules with respect to our corporate structure remains unclear, with no current consensus existing among leading PRC law firms regarding the scope and applicability of the M&A Rules. Thus, it is possible that the appropriate PRC government agencies, including MOFCOM, would deem that the M&A Rules required us or our entities in China to obtain approval from MOFCOM or other PRC regulatory agencies. If the CSRC, MOFCOM, or another PRC regulatory agency determines that government approval was required, or if prior CSRC approval for overseas financings is required and not obtained, we may face severe regulatory actions or other sanctions from MOFCOM, the CSRC, or other PRC regulatory agencies. In such event, these regulatory agencies may impose fines or other penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from overseas financings into the PRC, restrict or prohibit payment or remittance of dividends to us, or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation, and prospects, as well as the trading price of our Ordinary Shares. The CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies may also take actions requiring us, or making it advisable for us, to delay or cancel overseas financings, to restructure our current corporate structure, or to seek regulatory approvals that may be difficult or costly to obtain.\nThe M&A Rules, along with certain foreign exchange regulations discussed below, will be interpreted or implemented by the relevant government authorities in connection with our future offshore financings or acquisitions, and we cannot predict how they will affect our acquisition strategy.\nRisks related to a future determination that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB) is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor completely.\nThe audit report included in this prospectus, and our annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended July 31, 2021, was issued by ZH CPA, a U.S.-based accounting firm that is registered with the PCAOB and can be inspected by the PCAOB. We have no intention of dismissing ZH CPA in the future or of engaging any auditor not based in the U.S. and not subject to regular inspection by the PCAOB. There is no guarantee, however, that any future auditor engaged by the Company would remain subject to full PCAOB inspection during the entire term of our engagement. The PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections in China without the approval of Chinese government authorities. If it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor completely, investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection. Any audit reports not issued by auditors that are completely inspected by the PCAOB, or a lack of PCAOB inspections of audit work undertaken in China that prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our auditors audits and their quality control procedures, could result in a lack of assurance that our financial statements and disclosures are adequate and accurate. In addition, under the HFCAA, our securities may be prohibited from trading on the Nasdaq or other U.S. stock exchanges or in the over the counter trading market in the U.S. if our auditor is not inspected by the PCAOB for three consecutive years, and this ultimately could result in our Ordinary Shares being delisted. Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the AHFCAA, which, if enacted, would amend the HFCAA and require the SEC to prohibit an issuers securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges or in the over the counter trading market in the U.S. if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three.\nOn December 2, 2021, SEC has announced the adoption of amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCAA. The rules apply to registrants the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate (Commission-Identified Issuers). The final amendments require Commission-Identified Issuers to submit documentation to the SEC establishing that, if true, it is not owned or controlled by a governmental entity in the public accounting firms foreign jurisdiction. The amendments also require that a Commission-Identified Issuer that is a foreign issuer, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 3b-4, provide certain additional disclosures in its annual report for itself and any of its consolidated foreign operating entities. Further, the adopting release provides notice regarding the procedures the SEC has established to identify issuers and to impose trading prohibitions on the securities of certain Commission-Identified Issuers, as required by the HFCAA. The SEC will identify Commission-Identified Issuers for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 18, 2020. A Commission-Identified Issuer will be required to comply with the submission and disclosure requirements in the annual report for each year in which it was identified. If a registrant is identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer based on its annual report for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2021, the registrant will be required to comply with the submission or disclosure requirements in its annual report filing covering the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2022.\nRisks Relating to the Trading Market\nThe Warrants we sold in a Private Placement Completed on November 5, 2020 contain repricing features which may have the effect of limiting our ordinary share price and make it more expensive to raise capital in the future.\nIn a November 5, 2020, private placement, we sold warrants to purchase 869,565 Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of $4.60 per Ordinary Share. Each warrant will expire five years from the date of issuance. The warrant exercise price may be subject to adjustment in the event that we issue certain securities at prices below the then exercise price. In connection with our reverse stock split, the exercise price for these warrants were repriced at $2.74 per ordinary share. Until these warrants all exercised, these repricing exercise features may have the effect of limiting our ordinary share price and make it more expensive to raise capital in the future. As of July 31, 2022, 563,855 warrants have been exercised for 459,986 Ordinary Shares, among which 389,855 warrants were exercised at $2.74 per ordinary share for an aggregate total of $1.1 million, and the remaining 174,000 warrants were cashless exercises.\nSales of a significant number of our Ordinary Shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our Ordinary Shares.\nIn connection with a private placement of warrants to purchase 869,565 Ordinary Shares that closed on November 5, 2020, we have filed a registration statement allowing the holders of the warrants to resale the Ordinary Shares that they may acquire upon the exercise thereof in the public market. The exercise of the warrants and subsequent sales of those Ordinary Shares in the public market could depress the market price of our Ordinary Shares and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our Ordinary Shares would have on the market price of our Ordinary Shares.\nOur largest shareholder owns approximately 54.7% of our Ordinary Shares, which will allow him the ability to elect directors and approve matters requiring shareholder approval by way of resolution of members.\nMr. Jun Liu, who is our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, is currently the beneficial owner of 5,268,330 ordinary shares (as adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split), or 54.7% of our current outstanding Ordinary Shares (36.0% directly held by Tianzhen Investments Limited, an entity 100% owned by Mr. Liu, and the remaining 19.0% that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by Mr. Liu through the assignment of a proxy agreement entered with Eno Group Limited on September 30, 2018 to Tianzhen Investments Limited on February 10, 2021). Mr. Liu has the power to elect all directors and approve all matters requiring shareholder approval without the votes of any other shareholder, significant influence over a decision to enter into any corporate transaction, and the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of shareholders, regardless of whether or not our directors or other shareholders believe that such a transaction is in our best interests. Such concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change of control or other business combination, which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on the market price of our Ordinary Shares or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the then-prevailing market price for their Ordinary Shares.\nSince we are deemed a controlled company under the Nasdaq listing rules, we may follow certain exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that could adversely affect our public shareholders.\nOur largest shareholder owns more than a majority of the voting power of our outstanding ordinary shares. Under the Nasdaq listing rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group, or another company is a controlled company and is permitted to phase in its compliance with the independent committee requirements. Although we do not intend to rely on the controlled company exemptions under the Nasdaq listing rules even though we are deemed a controlled company, we could elect to rely on these exemptions in the future. If we were to elect to rely on the controlled company exemptions, a majority of the members of our board of directors might not be independent directors and our nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees might not consist entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, if we rely on the exemptions, during the period we remain a controlled company and during any transition period following a time when we are no longer a controlled company, you would not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our Ordinary Shares if the market price of our Ordinary Shares increases.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nWe are subject to reporting obligations under the U.S. securities laws. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, adopted rules requiring every public company to include a management report on such companys internal controls over financial reporting in its annual report, which contains managements assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal controls over financial reporting. As we are an emerging growth company, we are expected to first include a management report on our internal controls over financial reporting in our annual report in the second fiscal year end following the effectiveness of our IPO. As such, these requirements applied to our annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ending on July 31, 2021. Our management may conclude that our internal controls over our financial reporting are not effective. Moreover, even if our management concludes that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may still decline to attest to our managements assessment or may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our internal controls or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. Our reporting obligations as a public company will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future.\nPrior to our IPO, we were a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal controls and procedures. We plan to remedy our material weaknesses and other control deficiencies in time to meet the deadline imposed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we fail to timely achieve or maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting. Moreover, effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud. As a result, our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our Ordinary Shares. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will incur considerable costs and devote significant management time and efforts and other resources to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if the publish a negative report regarding our Ordinary Shares, the price of our Ordinary Shares and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Ordinary Shares may depend in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade us, the price of our Ordinary Shares would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price of our Ordinary Shares and the trading volume to decline.\nThe market price of our Ordinary Shares may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe market price of our Ordinary Shares may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results;\n\u25cf the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u25cf actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u25cf price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u25cf lawsuits threatened or filed against us; and\n\u25cf other events or factors, including those resulting from war or incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of many companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.\nBecause we are an emerging growth company, we may not be subject to requirements that other public companies are subject to, which could affect investor confidence in us and our Ordinary Shares.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure and other requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, most significantly, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for so long as we are an emerging growth company. As a result, if we elect not to comply with such auditor attestation requirements, our investors may not have access to certain information they may deem important. After we are no longer an emerging growth company, we expect to incur significant additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance increased disclosure requirements.\nBecause we have ceased to qualify as a foreign private issuer, we are required to comply fully with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, and we will incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses that we would not incur as a foreign private issuer.\nBecause we are no longer a foreign private issuer, we are no longer exempt from the rules under the Exchange Act prescribing the furnishing and content of proxy statements, and our officers, directors, and principal shareholders are no longer exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In addition, we are now required under the Exchange Act to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as United States domestic issuers, and we are now required to disclose in our periodic reports all of the information that United States domestic issuers are required to disclose.\nIf we were deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business and the price of our Ordinary Shares.\nWe do not believe that we are an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act). Generally, a person is an investment company if it owns investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. However, if we were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and would have a material adverse effect on our business and the price of our Ordinary Shares.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control.\nSome provisions in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company or management that shareholders may consider favorable, including, among other things, the following:\n\u25cf provisions that permit our board of directors by resolution to amend certain provisions of the memorandum and articles of association, including to create and issue classes of shares with preferred, deferred or other special rights or restrictions as the board of directors determine in their discretion, without any further vote or action by our shareholders. If issued, the rights, preferences, designations, and limitations of any class of preferred shares would be set by the board of directors by way of amendments to relevant provisions of the memorandum and articles of association and could operate to the disadvantage of the outstanding ordinary shares the holders of which would not have any pre-emption rights in respect of such an issue of preferred shares. Such terms could include, among others, preferences as to dividends and distributions on liquidation, or could be used to prevent possible corporate takeovers; and\n\u25cf provisions that restrict the ability of our shareholders holding in aggregate less than thirty percent (30%) of the outstanding voting shares in the company to call meetings and to include matters for consideration at shareholder meetings.\nBecause we are a BVI company, you may be unable to bring an action against us or our officers and directors or to enforce any judgment you may obtain.\nWe are incorporated in the BVI and some of our directors and officers reside outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us or against these individuals in the United States in the event that you believe we have violated your rights, either under United States federal or state securities laws or otherwise, or if you have a claim against us. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the BVI may not permit you to enforce a judgment against our assets outside of the United States or the assets of our directors and officers.\nOur board of directors may decline to register transfers of ordinary shares in certain circumstances.\nOur board of directors may, in its sole discretion, decline to register any transfer of any Ordinary Share issued in certificated form, which is not fully paid up or on which we have a lien. Our directors may also decline to register any transfer of any share issued in certificated form in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the share is to be transferred does not exceed four. A shareholder wishing to transfer its Ordinary Shares is liable to pay to the Company a fee of such maximum sum as Nasdaq Capital Market may determine to be payable, or such lesser sum as our board of directors may from time to time require in respect thereof.\nIf our directors refuse to register a transfer they shall, within one month after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged, send to each of the transferor and the transferee notice of such refusal. The registration of transfers may, on 14 days notice being given by advertisement in such one or more newspapers or by electronic means, be suspended and the register closed at such times and for such periods as our board of directors may from time to time determine, provided, however, that the registration of transfers shall not be suspended nor the register closed for more than 30 days in any year.\nCertain types of class or derivative actions generally available under U.S. law may not be available as a result of the fact that we are incorporated in the BVI. As a result, the rights of shareholders may be limited.\nWhilst statutory provisions do exist in British Virgin Islands law for derivative actions to be brought in certain circumstances, these rights may be more limited than the rights afforded to minority shareholders under the laws of states in the United States and shareholders of BVI companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a court of the United States. Furthermore, questions of interpretation of our memorandum and articles of association will be questions of BVI law and determined by the BVI courts. In any event, the circumstances in which any such action may be brought, if at all, and the procedures and defenses that may be available in respect to any such action, may result in the rights of shareholders of a BVI company being more limited than those of shareholders of a company organized in the United States. Accordingly, shareholders may have fewer alternatives available to them if they believe that corporate wrongdoing has occurred. The BVI courts are also unlikely to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts in the United States based on certain liability provisions of U.S. securities law or to impose liabilities against us, in original actions brought in the BVI, based on certain liability provisions of U.S. securities laws that are penal in nature.\nThere is no statutory recognition in the BVI of judgments obtained in the United States, although the courts of the BVI will in certain circumstances recognize such a foreign judgment and treat it as a cause of action in itself which may be sued upon as a debt at common law so that no retrial of the issues would be necessary provided that:\n(i) the U.S. court issuing the judgment had jurisdiction in the matter and the company either submitted to such jurisdiction or was resident or carrying on business within such jurisdiction and was duly served with process; is final and for a liquidated sum;\n(ii) the judgment given by the U.S. court was not in respect of penalties, taxes, fines or similar fiscal or revenue obligations of the company;\n(iii) in obtaining judgment there was no fraud on the part of the person in whose favor judgment was given or on the part of the court;\n(iv) recognition or enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary to public policy in the BVI; and\n(v) the proceedings pursuant to which judgment was obtained were not contrary to natural justice.\nIn appropriate circumstances, a BVI Court may give effect in the British Virgin Islands to other kinds of final foreign judgments such as declaratory orders, orders for performance of contracts and injunctions.\nRecent statements by the SEC on the PRCs guidance and restrictions on China-based companies seeking to raise capital in the United States may raise scrutiny as to our operations and SEC disclosures.\nIn light of the PRC providing new guidance to and restrictions on China-based companies raising capital offshore, including PRC government-led cybersecurity reviews, the Chairman of the SEC has requested his staff to review disclosures from offshore issuers associated with China-based operating companies in connection with the filing of registration statements in the United States. In particular, the SEC Chairman was concerned about an investors understanding of a VIE contract structure. We previously conducted our going public related consulting service business through Qianhai utilizing a VIE contract structure which relationship was terminated in February 2021. In connection with our internal reorganization in January and February 2021, we terminated the Qianhai VIE agreements. The termination of the Qianhai VIE agreements did not discontinue our public listing related consulting service business, because such consulting service business has been transferred to Huaya to serve the client located in China and to ATIF Inc. to serve the clients located within the United States. Currently, we plan to use Huaya, a wholly owned subsidiary of ATIF, to continue to provide consulting services to our clients located in the PRC, and we do not plan to use variable interest entities to execute our business plan and to conduct our China-based operations in the near term. However, since we have business operations in China, there is always a risk that the Chinese government may in the future seek to intervene or influence operations of any company with any level of operations in China, including its ability to offer securities to investors, list its securities on a U.S. or other foreign exchange, conduct its business or accept foreign investment. If we conduct business in the PRC in the future with a PRC entity using a VIE contract structure, that business structure may subject us to further review by the SEC.\nYou may have more difficulty protecting your interests than you would as a shareholder of a U.S. corporation.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by the provisions of our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time, the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004 as amended from time to time (the BVI Act) and the common law of the BVI. The rights of shareholders and the statutory duties and fiduciary responsibilities of our directors and officers under BVI law may not be clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in some jurisdictions in the United States, and some states (such as Delaware) have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law.\nThese rights and responsibilities are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the BVI Act and the common law of the BVI. The common law of the BVI is derived in part from judicial precedent in the BVI as well as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the BVI. In addition, BVI law does not make a distinction between public and private companies and some of the protections and safeguards (such as statutory pre-emption rights, save to the extent expressly provided for in the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association) that investors may expect to find in relation to a public company are not provided for under BVI law.\nThere may be less publicly available information about us than is regularly published by or about U.S. issuers. Also, the BVI regulations governing the securities of BVI companies may not be as extensive as those in effect in the United States, and the BVI law and regulations regarding corporate governance matters may not be as protective of minority shareholders as state corporation laws in the United States. Therefore, you may have more difficulty protecting your interests in connection with actions taken by our directors and officers or our principal shareholders than you would as a shareholder of a corporation incorporated in the United States.\nThe laws of BVI provide limited protections for minority shareholders, so minority shareholders will not have the same options as to recourse in comparison to the United States if the shareholders are dissatisfied with the conduct of our affairs.\nUnder the laws of the BVI there is limited statutory protection of minority shareholders other than the provisions of the BVI Act dealing with shareholder remedies. The principal protections under BVI statutory law are derivative actions, actions brought by one or more shareholders for relief from unfair prejudice, oppression and unfair discrimination and/or to enforce the BVI Act or the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Shareholders are entitled to have the affairs of the company conducted in accordance with the BVI Act and the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, and are entitled to payment of the fair value of their respective shares upon dissenting from certain enumerated corporate transactions.\nThe common law of the BVI is derived in part from judicial precedent in the BVI as well as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the BVI. There are common law rights for the protection of shareholders that may be invoked, largely dependent on English company law, since the common law of the BVI is less extensive than that of England. Under the general rule pursuant to English company law known as the rule in Foss v. Harbottle, a court will generally refuse to interfere with the management of a company at the insistence of a minority of its shareholders who express dissatisfaction with the conduct of the companys affairs by the majority or the board of directors. However, every shareholder is entitled to seek to have the affairs of the company conducted properly according to law and the constitutional documents of the company. As such, if those who control the company have persistently disregarded the requirements of company law or the provisions of the companys memorandum and articles of association, then the courts may grant relief. Generally, the areas in which the courts will intervene are the following: (i) a company is acting or proposing to act illegally or beyond the scope of its authority; (ii) the act complained of, although not beyond the scope of the authority, could only be effected if duly authorized by more than the number of votes which have actually been obtained; (iii) the individual rights of the plaintiff shareholder have been infringed or are about to be infringed; or (iv) those who control the company are perpetrating a fraud on the minority.\nThese rights may be more limited than the rights afforded to minority shareholders under the laws of states in the United States.\nThere are no pre-emptive rights in favor of holders of ordinary shares so you may not be able to participate in future equity offerings.\nThere are no pre-emptive rights applicable under the BVI Act or the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association in favor of holders of ordinary shares in respect of further issues of shares of any class. Consequently, you will not be entitled under applicable law to participate in any such future offerings of further ordinary shares or any preferred or other classes of shares.\nIf we are classified as a passive foreign investment company, United States taxpayers who own our Ordinary Shares may have adverse United States federal income tax consequences.\nA non-U.S. corporation such as ourselves will be classified as a passive foreign investment company, which is known as a PFIC, for any taxable year if, for such year, either\n\u25cf At least 75% of our gross income for the year is passive income; or\n\u25cf The average percentage of our assets (determined at the end of each quarter) during the taxable year which produce passive income or which are held for the production of passive income is at least 50%.\nPassive income generally includes dividends, interest, rents and royalties (other than rents or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or business), and gains from the disposition of passive assets.\nIf we are determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. taxpayer who holds our ordinary shares, the U.S. taxpayer may be subject to increased U.S. federal income tax liability and may be subject to additional reporting requirements.\nDepending on the amount of assets held for the production of passive income, it is possible that, for our 2022 taxable year or for any subsequent year, more than 50% of our assets may be assets which produce passive income. We will make this determination following the end of any particular tax year. For purposes of the PFIC analysis, in general, according to Internal Revenue Code Section 1297(c), a non-U.S. corporation is deemed to own its pro rata share of the gross income and assets of any entity in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the stock by value. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur principal executive office and production facility is located in Lake Forest, California, USA, where we lease approximately 7237 square feet of office space. We lease an aggregate of 7237 square feet of property from an unrelated third party pursuant to the terms of a lease agreement. The term of the lease is from June 1, 2021 to May 31, 2027, with monthly rental expenses of $20,000.\nIn addition, we also lease an office space in Irvine, California, for approximately 4182 square feet of office space for a term of three years from March 1, 2021 to February 29, 2024, and with monthly rental expenses of $20,073. As of August 25, 2022, we have subleased this office space to an unrelated third party company from August 25, 2022 to March 1, 2024. Our total rent expense was approximately $0.5 million and $0.6 million for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWe believe that our current leased property is in good condition and suitable for the conduct of our business. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. Except for the litigation disclosed below, we are not currently a party to any legal or arbitration proceeding the outcome of which, if \u2018determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition.\nOn May 14, 2020, Boustead filed a lawsuit against the Company and Leaping Group Co., Ltd. a limited liability organized under the laws of Cayman Islands (LGC) for breaching the underwriting agreement Boustead had with each of the Company and LGC, in which Boustead was separately engaged as the exclusive financial advisor to provide financial advisory services to the Company and LGC.\nIn April 2020, the Company acquired 51.2% equity interest in LGC after LGC terminated its efforts to launch an IPO on its own. Boustead alleged that the acquisition transaction between the Company and LGC was entered into during the lockup period of the exclusive agreement between Boustead and LGC, and therefore deprived Boustead of compensation that Boustead would otherwise have been entitled to receive under its exclusive agreement with LGC. Therefore, Boustead is attempting to recover from the Company an amount equal to a percentage of the value of the transaction it conducted with LGC.\nBousteads Complaint alleged four causes of action against the Company, including breach of contract; breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; tortious interference with business relationships and quantum meruit.\nOn October 6, 2020, we filed a motion to dismiss Bousteads Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(5). On October 9, 2020, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York directed Boustead to respond to the motion or amend its Complaint by November 10, 2020. Boustead opted to amend its complaint and filed the amended complaint on November 10, 2020. Bousteads first amended complaint asserted the same four causes of action against LGC and us as its original complaint. We filed another motion to dismiss Bousteads amended complaint on December 8, 2020.\nOn August 25, 2021, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted ATIFs motion to dismiss Bousteads first amended complaint. In its order and opinion, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York allowed Boustead to move for leave to amend its causes of action against us as to breach of contract and tortious interference with business relationships, but not breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and quantum meruit. On November 4, 2021, Boustead filed a motion seeking leave to file a second amended complaint to amend its cause of action for Breach of Contract. The Court granted Bousteads motion for leave and Boustead filed the second amended complaint on December 28, 2021 alleging only breach of contract and dropping all other causes of action alleged in the original complaint. On January 18, 2022, the Company filed a motion to dismiss Bousteads second amended complaint. Boustead filed its opposition on February 1, 2022 and the Company replied on February 8, 2022.\nOn July 6, 2022, the Court denied our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. Thereafter, on August 3, 2022, the Company filed a motion to compel arbitration of Bousteads claims in California. Briefing on the Companys motion to compel concluded on August 23, 2022. The Court has yet to rule on that motion. Boustead is also seeking a default judgment against LGC and recently filed an order to show cause for default judgment against LGC. The Court has not ruled on Bousteads request for entry of default judgment against LGC.\nIn sum, the Boustead litigation is currently in the pleadings stage. Our management believes it is premature to assess and predict the outcome of this pending litigation. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5 - MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket for Common Stock\nOur Ordinary Shares have been listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market since May 3, 2019, under the symbol ATIF.\nHolders of Record of Ordinary Shares\nAs of October 25, 2022, we had approximately 32 shareholders of record for our ordinary shares.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale by the selling shareholders of the ordinary shares. Upon any exercise of the warrants by payment of cash, however, we will receive the exercise price of the warrants.\nIn April 2021, we filed a registration statement on Form (File Number 333-255545) to offer ordinary shares and warrants to purchase ordinary shares not to exceed an aggregate offering price of up to $15,000.000. We intend to use the net proceeds from such offerings in the manner as disclosed in our registration statement on Form (File Number 333-255545).\nOn August 12, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split (the Reverse Split) of the Companys issued and outstanding ordinary shares, par value $0.001 per share, at a ratio of 5-for-1 so that every five (5) shares of US$0.001 par value in issue on the date of the Reverse Split was combined into one (1) share of US$0.005 par value.

[RESERVED] ITEM 7. - MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the statements contained in the following discussion of the Companys financial condition and results of operations refer to future expectations or include other forward-looking information. Those statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contemplated, including, but not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this report under the heading Risk Factors, which are incorporated herein by reference. See Special Note regarding Forward-Looking Statements included in this Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of factors to be considered when evaluating forward-looking information detailed below. These factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.\nBusiness Overview\nWe offer financial consulting services to small and medium-sized enterprise customers in Asia and North America. Our goal is to become an international financial consulting company with clients and offices throughout Asia. Since our inception in 2015, the focus of our consulting business has been providing comprehensive going public consulting services designed to help SMEs become public companies on suitable markets and exchanges.\nOn January 4, 2021, we established an office in California, USA, through our wholly owned subsidiary ATIF Inc., a California corporation, and launched, in addition to our business consulting services, additional service models consisting of asset management, investment holding and media services to expand our business with a flexible business concept to achieve a goal of high growth revenue and strong profit growth.\nReverse Split\nOn August 12, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split (the Reverse Split) of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares, par value $0.001 per share, at a ratio of 5-for-1 so that every five (5) shares of US$0.001 par value in issue on the date of the Reverse Split was combined into one (1) share of US$0.005 par value. Shareholders otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share as a result of the reverse stock split will receive a whole share in lieu of such factional share, as relevant. Both before and after completion of the Reverse Split, the Company is and will be authorized to issue 100,000,000,000 ordinary shares of US$0.001 par value each. As a result of the Reverse Split, the Companys issued and outstanding ordinary shares was reduced from 45,806,952 ordinary shares of US$0.001 par value each to approximately 9,161,390 ordinary shares of par value $0.005 per share. On August 23, 2021, we amended our Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association in connection with our five-for-one reverse stock split to amend the par value back to $0.001 per ordinary share. Our ordinary shares, as adjusted per the Reverse Split, began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on August 30, 2021.\nRecent Updates\nOn February 16, 2021, ATIF-1, LP (ATIF LP) was established as a private equity fund through our indirectly-wholly owned subsidiary, ATIF-1 GP, LLC (ATIF GP), a Delaware limited liability company, as the general partner. We own 76.6% limited partner interest in ATIF, LP. The investment manager for the fund is ATIF Inc. ATIF LP manages approximately $1.3 million and $4.8 million assets under management (AUM) as of July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the year ended July 31, 2022, three limited partners of ATIF LP withdrew the investment of $3.0 million. In addition, the Company also paid investment gain of $29,149 to the limited partner, which was recorded as a reduction of non-controlling interest. On August 1, 2022, ATIF USA entered into and closed a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the Agreement) with Asia Time (HK) International Finance Service Limited (the Buyer), pursuant to which the Company sold all of its equity interest in ATIF GP for cash consideration of US$50,000 (the Agreement). The management believed the disposition does not represent a strategic shift because it is not changing the way it is running its business. The Company has not shifted the nature of its operations. The termination is not accounted as discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 205-20. Upon the closing of the Agreement, ATIF GP is no longer our subsidiary and ATIF USA ceased to be the investment manager of ATIF LP.\nOn May 31, 2022, we completed the transfer of our equity interest in ATIF HK and Huaya to Mr. Pishan Chi for $nil consideration. The transfer of equity interest was to mitigate the potential risks arising from the PRC government provision of new guidance to and restrictions on China-based companies raising capital offshore. We determined that the transfer of our equity interest in ATIF HK and Huaya did not have a major effect on its operations and financial results as we did not change our way of running business. We also determined that the transfer of equity interest does not represent a strategic shift in our business because there was no change to our operation of our consulting services. There was no change to the nature of our business, and did not affect our customers in North America, which is the major geographic market area of our business. The termination is not accounted as discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 205-20.\nOn February 3, 2021, we closed termination of our variable interest entity (VIE) agreements with Qianhai Asia Times (Shenzhen) International Financial Services Co., Ltd. (Qianhai) and its shareholders. As of the date of this report, we do not, and do not plan to use variable interest entities to execute our business plan or to conduct our China-based operations. Qianhai transferred all of its China-based business and employees to Huaya before termination of the VIE agreements. The termination of the VIE agreements did not cause material impairment of our long-lived assets (primarily including fixed assets such as office furniture and equipment and automobile) because all of the fixed assets have been transferred to our PRC subsidiary Huaya upon termination of the VIE agreements and there were no assets held for sale or disposal. The termination of the Qianhai VIE agreements does not represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the Companys operations because our consulting service business as originally undertook by Qianhai has been transferred to Huaya and ATIF Inc. to serve the clients located in China and U.S. respectively. The termination of the VIE agreements did not cause any regulatory penalties or non-compete agreements. As a result, management concluded that the termination of the Qianhai VIE agreements does not deemed to be a discontinued operation of our consulting service business.\nOn January 29, 2021, we completed the disposition of 51.2% of the equity interest of LGC. We sold all of our shares of LGC to Jiang Bo, Jiang Tao and Wang Di (collectively, the Buyers) in exchange for (i) 1,111,110 of our ordinary shares owned by the Buyers and (ii) payment by the Buyers in the amount of $2,300,000 plus interest at an interest rate of 10% per annum on the unpaid amount if the principal amount of US$2,300,000 is not paid by January 14, 2022. All principal and accrued and unpaid interest shall be due on January 14, 2023. As of July 31, 2022, the principal and accrued and unpaid interest amounted to $2,654,767.\nAs of July 31, 2022, we have one reporting segment, which is the provision of financial consulting services.\nOur financial consulting services\nWe launched our consulting services in 2015. Our aim was to assist these Chinese enterprises by filling the gaps and forming a bridge between PRC companies and overseas markets and exchanges. We have a team of qualified and experienced personnel with legal, regulatory, and language expertise in several overseas jurisdictions. Our services are designed to help SMEs in China achieve their goal of becoming public companies. We create a going public strategy for each client based on many factors, including our assessment of the clients financial and operational situations, market conditions, and the clients business and financing requirements. Since our inception and up to the date of this report, we have successfully helped three Chinese enterprises to be quoted on the U.S. OTC markets and are currently assisting our other clients in their respective going public efforts. All of our current and past clients have been Chinese companies, and we plan to expand our operations to other Asian countries, such as Malaysia, Vietnam, and Singapore in the coming years.\nFor the year ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, we provided consulting services to three customers and three customers, respectively, which primarily engaged the Company to provide consulting services relating to going public in the US through IPO, reverse merger and acquisition. The low volume of consulting services was due to the recent intense tariff issues between the U.S. and China, which has become more fragile as a result of the outbreak and spread of COVID-19, plus the tightening of U.S. legislation and public listing rules to curb some small Chinese companies to access the U.S. capital markets. As a result, an increasing number of Chinese companies are putting off or slowing down their plans for U.S. listings due to these uncertainties. On May 31, 2022, we completed the transfer of our equity interest in ATIF HK and Huaya, through which we provided consulting services to Chinese companies We plan to focus on providing consulting services to customers based in North America and other areas and intend to continue cooperating with Huaya in connection with the expansion and provision of our business services in China. From April 2022 through the date of this report, the Company entered into consulting agreements with five customers, among which four are based in the North America.\nOur total revenue generated from consulting services amounted to $1.6 million and $0.9 million for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nKey Factors that Affect our Business\nWe believe the following key factors may affect our consulting services:\nThe trade disputes between China and the United States has negatively impacted our business.\nDuring the past two years, the U.S. government has, among other actions, imposed new or higher tariffs on specified products imported from China to penalize China for what it characterizes as unfair trade practices and China has responded by imposing new or higher tariffs on specified products imported from the United States. The uncertainties arising from the trade disputes between China and the United States negatively impacted our potential customers confidence to go public through IPOs in the United States in fiscal year 2020 through 2022. As a result, both the number of our new going public consulting service customers and our going public consulting service revenue were kept at low volume in fiscal year 2022 and 2021.\nOur business success depends on our ability to acquire customers effectively.\nOur customer acquisition channels primarily include our sales and marketing campaigns and existing customer referrals. In order to acquire customers, we have made significant efforts in building mutually beneficial long-term relationships with local government, academic institutions, and local business associations. In addition, we also market our consulting services through social media, such as WeChat or Weibo. If any of our current customer acquisition channels becomes less effective, if we are unable to continue to use any of these channels or if we are not successful in using new channels, we may not be able to attract new customers in a cost-effective manner or convert potential customers into active customers or even lose our existing customers to our competitors. To the extent that our current customer acquisition and retention efforts become less effective, our service revenue may be significantly impacted, which would have a significant adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur consulting business faces strong market competition.\nWe are currently facing intense market competition. Some of our current or potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and support of their customer acquisition and retention channels. In light of the low barriers to entry in the financial consulting industry, we expect more players to enter this market and increase the level of competition. Our ability to differentiate our services from other competitors will have significant impact on our business growth in the future\nChanges in PRC regulatory environment may impact our business and results of operations.\nThe regulatory environment for the financial consulting industry in China is evolving. Recently, many local governments have established various subsidization schemes and policies to stimulate and encourage local business enterprises to go public, and this may stimulate the growth of more financial consulting firms to become new players given the low barrier of entry into the financial consulting industry as well. As more players enter into the competition, PRC governmental authorities may publish and promulgate various new laws and rules to regulate the financial consulting marketplace. We have been closely tracking the development and implementation of new rules and regulations likely to affect us. We will continue to ensure timely compliance with any new rules and regulations and believe that such timely compliance is essential to our growth. To the extent that we may be required to adapt our operations to new laws and regulations, our operating costs may increase which will impact our profitability.\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nWe rely heavily on the expertise and leadership of our directors and officers to maintain our core competence. Under their leadership, we have been able to achieve rapid expansion and significant growth since our inception in 2015. As our business scope increases, we expect to continue to invest significant resources in hiring and retaining a deep talent pool of financial consultancy professionals. Our ability to sustain our growth will depend on our ability to attract qualified personnel and retain our current staff.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Operation Results for the Years Ended July 31, 2022 and 2021\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and provides information regarding the dollar and percentage increase or (decrease) during such periods.\nFor the years ended\nChanges\nJuly 31,\nJuly 31,\nAmount\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nPercentage\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nRevenues - third parties\n$ 905,310\n$ 936,935\n$ (31,625 )\n(3 )%\nRevenues - related party\n762,000\n-\n762,000\n%\nRevenues\n$ 1,667,310\n$ 936,935\n$ 730,375\n%\nCost of revenues\n(660,000 )\n-\n(660,000 )\n%\nGross profit\n1,007,310\n936,935\n70,375\n%\nOperating expenses:\nSelling expenses\n569,529\n439,174\n130,355\n%\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n2,651,361\n2,919,675\n(268,314 )\n(9 )%\nTotal operating expenses\n3,220,890\n3,358,849\n(137,959 )\n(4 )%\nLoss from operations\n(2,213,580 )\n(2,421,914 )\n208,334\n(9 )%\nOther income (expenses):\nInterest income, net\n354,832\n354,519\n113,265 %\nOther expenses, net\n(123,296 )\n(84,194 )\n(39,102 )\n%\nLoss from investment in trading securities\n(2,432,107 )\n(258,738 )\n(2,173,369 )\n%\nGain from disposal of subsidiaries and VIE\n1,043,052\n390,183\n652,869\n%\nTotal other (expense) income, net\n(1,157,519 )\n47,564\n(1,205,083 )\n(2,534 )%\nLoss before income taxes\n(3,371,099 )\n(2,374,350 )\n(996,749 )\n(42 )%\nIncome tax provision\n-\n-\n-\n%\nNet loss from continuing operations\n(3,371,099 )\n(2,374,350 )\n(996,749 )\n(42 )%\nNet loss from discontinued operations\n-\n(6,625,898 )\n6,625,898\n(100 )%\nNet loss\n$ (3,371,099 )\n$ (9,000,248 )\n$ 5,629,149\n(63 )%\nRevenues. Our total revenue increased by $0.73 million, or 78%, from $0.9 million in fiscal year 2021, to $1.7 million in fiscal year 2022, primarily attributable to completion of more phases of consulting services to customers. Among the revenues of $1.7 million, $0.8 million was contributed from a related party. In July 2022, we provided consulting services to one of our related partys customers and earned revenues $0.8 million.\nFor the year ended July 31, 2022, provision of our going public consulting services remained stable as compared with that of the same period of 2021. For the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, we provided going public services to three and three customers. Our low-volume provision of consulting services was mainly attributable to tightening of U.S. legislation and public listing rules to curb some small Chinese companies to access the U.S. capital markets. Accordingly an increasing number of Chinese companies are putting off or slowing down their plans for U.S. listings due to these uncertainties. As a result, our potential customers perception and confidence to go public through initial public offerings (IPOs) in the United States has been negatively impacted.\nGiven the uncertainty arising from the tightened U.S. legislation and public listing rules to curb IPOs by small Chinese companies to access the United States capital market, we anticipate our limited revenue growth from our consulting services and our continuous operating net loss in the near terms. However, we terminated VIE agreements with Qianhai and its shareholders, and we transferred equity interest in ATIF HK and Huaya, and we aimed to provide our consulting services to more customers based in the U.S. We also plan to hire more specialized and talented employees in order to provide better services to our customers in the future. We believe our competitive strengths, including but not limited to, highly qualified professional service team with extensive experience in going public and consulting services, recognition and reputation of our services achieved from our previous success helping our clients going public, established long-term professional relationships with a group of well-known third-party professional providers both domestically and in the U.S., and established long-term cooperation relationships with local chambers of commerce and associations, will help us develop more customers for our consulting services to generate increased revenue in the long run.\nFrom April 2022 through the date of this report, we have entered into consulting service agreement with five customers, among which four are based in the North America.\nCost of revenues. We incurred cost of revenues of $0.7 million in the fiscal year 2022 which was mainly incurred for direct costs including purchase of a shell company on the over-the-counter (OTC) market and consulting expenses for one customer.\nSelling expenses. Selling expenses increased by $0.1 million, or 30%, from $0.4 million in fiscal year 2021 to $0.5 million in fiscal year 2022. Our selling expenses primarily consisted of outsourced service fees charged by third-party service providers, business development expenses, potential customer referral commissions, salary and welfare expenses of our business development team, and business travel expenses. The decrease in our selling expenses was primarily due to the following reasons: 1) an increase of $0.3 million in consulting service fees for two consultants and marketing services for three consulting firms; partially offset against 2) a decrease of $0.2 million in expenses incurred by Qianhai, the VIE agreement with which was terminated in February 2021.\nAs a percentage of sales, our selling expenses were 34% and 47% of our total revenues for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. Our general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.3 million, or 9%, from $2.9 million in fiscal year 2021 to $2.6 million in fiscal year 2022. Our general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of salary and welfare expenses of management and administrative team, office expenses, operating lease expenses, and professional fees such as audit and legal fees. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease of professional fees of $0.4 million because our auditor and counselor decreased service fees with termination of Qianhai VIE Agreement, partially offset against an increase of payroll and welfare expenses of $0.1 million as we employed increasing headcount in the USA.\nAs a percentage of sales, our general and administrative expenses were 159% and 312% of our total revenues for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nInterest income, net. For the year ended July 31, 2022, interest income represented 1) the interest income of $0.4 million from outstanding balance of $2.3 million due from buyers of LGC arising from the Companys disposition of 51.2% equity interest in LGC. The interest rate for outstanding balance was 10% per annum, and 2) the minimal interest income from bank deposits. For the year ended July 31, 2021, interest income arose from bank deposits.\nLoss from investment in trading securities. Loss from investment in trading securities represented fair value changes from investment in trading securities, which was measured at market price. For the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded an investment loss of $2.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively.\nGain from disposal of subsidiaries and VIE. For the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company reported a gain of $1.0 million from disposal of ATIF HK and Huaya. For the year ended July 31, 2021, the Company reported a gain of $0.4 million from termination of VIE agreement with Qianhai.\nNet loss from discontinued operations. In January 2021, we completed the disposition of 51.2% of the equity interest of LGC. The results of LGC, as a discontinued operation, for the years ended July 31, 2021 are reported as components of net loss separate from the net loss of continuing operations. For details of composition of net loss from discontinued operations, please see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included with this annual report.\nIncome taxes. We are incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Under the current laws of the British Virgin Islands, we are not subject to tax on income or capital gains in the British Virgin Islands. Additionally, upon payments of dividends to the shareholders, no British Virgin Islands withholding tax will be imposed.\nATIF HK is subject to Hong Kong profits tax at a rate of 16.5%. However, ATIF HK did not have any assessable profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, and accordingly no provision for Hong Kong profits tax had been made in these periods.\nHuaya was incorporated in the PRC. Under the Income Tax Laws of the PRC, Huaya is subject to income tax at a rate of 10% under the preferential tax treatment to Smaller-scale Taxpayers.\nATIF Inc, ATIF GP, ATIF LP and ATIF BD were incorporated in the U.S and are subject to federal and state income taxes on its business operations. The federal tax rate is 21% and state tax rate is 8.84%. We also evaluated the impact from the recent tax reforms in the United States, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) and Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act (HERO Act), which were both passed in 2020, No material impact on the ATIF US is expected based on our analysis. We will continue to monitor the potential impact going forward.\nIncome tax expense was $nil and $nil for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021 due to significant net operating loss in fiscal year 2022 and 2021 which resulted in taxable losses.\nNet loss. As a result of foregoing, net loss was $3.4 million for the year ended July 31, 2022, a decrease of $5.6 million from net loss of $9.0 million in fiscal year 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through cash flows from operations, working capital loans from our major shareholders, proceeds from our initial public offering, and equity financing through public offerings of our securities. We plan to support our future operations primarily from cash generated from our operations and cash on hand.\nLiquidity and Going concern\nFor the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company reported a net loss from continuing operations of approximately $3.4 million and $2.4 million, respectively, and operating cash outflows from continuing operations of approximately $0.1 million and $2.5 million.\nIn assessing the Companys ability to continue as a going concern, the Company monitors and analyzes its cash and its ability to generate sufficient cash flow in the future to support its operating and capital expenditure commitments.\nAs of July 31, 2022, the Company had cash of $1.8 million. On the other hand, the Company had current liabilities of $2.8 million. Currently the Company had three service-in-progress agreements, and expected to generate consulting service fees of $2.5 million for the next 12 months. The Company also had $2.7 million receivable from buyers of LGC in connection with the disposal of LGC which will be due in early 2023. In addition, due to the recent intense relationship between the U.S. and China, which has become more fragile as a result of the outbreak and spread of COVID-19, plus the tightening of U.S. legislation and public listing rules to curb some small Chinese companies to access the U.S. capital markets, an increasing number of Chinese companies are putting off or slowing down their plans for U.S. listings due to these uncertainties. Furthermore, due to the impact of COVID-19, some of our existing customers may experience financial distress or business disruptions, which could lead to potential delay or default on their payments. Any increased difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, or early termination of our existing consulting service agreements due to deterioration in economic conditions could further negatively impact our cash flows. Given these factors, our potential customers perception and confidence to go public in the United States has been negatively impacted and our operating revenue and cash flows may continue to underperform in the near terms. Although we had cash of $1.8 million as of July 31, 2022, given the above-mentioned uncertainties, the management believes that the Company will continue as a going concern in the following 12 months from the date the Companys 2022 consolidated financial statements are issued.\nWe believe that our existing cash, together with $3.2 million that currently remains available under our $8.0 million revolving line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB Credit Facility), and $4.0 million available under the subordinated line of credit (Subordinated LOC) as of September 12, 2022, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital resources to fund planned operations for the next twelve (12) months.\nCurrently, the Company intends to finance its future working capital requirements and capital expenditures from cash generated from operating activities and funds raised from equity financings. In October 2021, the Company raised proceeds of $1.1 million from exercise of warrants to purchase 389,855 of its ordinary shares by warrant holders who subscribed for ordinary shares in the registered direct offering closed in November 2020.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above.\nWe have not declared nor paid any cash dividends to our shareholders. We do not plan to pay any dividends out of our restricted net assets as of July 31, 2022.\nWe have limited financial obligations denominated in U.S. dollars, thus the foreign currency restrictions and regulations in the PRC on the dividends distribution will not have a material impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe following table sets forth summary of our cash flows for the years indicated:\nFor the Years Ended\nJuly 31,\nNet cash used in by operating activities $ (146,944 ) $ (2,667,060 )\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities (1,591,535 ) 861,921\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities (1,960,946 ) 6,835,000\nEffect of exchange rate change on cash (147,178 ) 138,611\nNet (decrease) increase in cash (3,846,603 ) 5,187,083\nCash, beginning of year 5,596,740 428,258\nCash, end of year $ 1,750,137 $ 5,596,740\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $0.1 million in fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. Net cash used in operating activities was primarily comprised of net loss of $3.4 million, adjusted for loss of $2.4 million from investment in trading securities, and net changes in our operating assets and liabilities, principally comprising of an increase of accounts receivable of $0.8 million due from a related party, and an increase of accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $1.8 million as the Company is liable to an investment bank for loss making during the year ended July 31, 2022.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million in fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, consisting of the net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations and discontinued operations of $2.6 million and $0.1 million, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was primarily comprised of net loss from continuing operations of $2.4 million, adjusted for amortization of right-of-use assets of $0.5 million, loss of $0.3 million from investment in trading securities, and net changes in our operating assets and liabilities, principally comprising of a decrease of tax payable by $0.6 million and a decrease of lease liabilities of $0.5 million due to the termination of our VIE agreements with Qianhai and its shareholders, leading to the decrease of such accounts.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.6 million in fiscal year 2022, primarily consisting of purchase of investment of $1.4 million in listed equity securities, investment of $0.3 million in two equity securities, against proceeds of $0.2 million from disposal of property and equipment.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $0.9 million in fiscal year 2021, primarily consisting of purchase of investment of $0.4 million in listed equity securities, collection of investment deposit of $1.2 million for life insurance contract, against cash of $0.1 million provided by discontinued operations.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $2.0 million in fiscal year 2022, primarily consisting of payment of $3.0 million to three limited partners of ATIF LP, as withdrawal of investment, partially offset by proceeds of $1.1 million in relation to exercise of warrants by investors who subscribed for ordinary shares offered in registered direct offering which closed in November 2020.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $6.8 million in fiscal year 2021, primarily consisting of capital injection of $3.3 million from ATIF LP, and capital of $3.5 million raised in a registered direct offering in November 2020.\nCritical Accounting Estimate\nWe prepare our audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires our management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our estimates on our own historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable after taking account of our circumstances and expectations for the future based on available information. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis.\nOur expectations regarding the future are based on available information and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, which together form our basis for making judgments about matters that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, our actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require a higher degree of judgment than others in their application.\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. When reading our audited consolidated financial statements, you should consider our selection of critical accounting policies, the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions.\nValuation allowance for deferred tax assets\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in earnings. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance through a charge to income tax expense when, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that a portion of or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe operate through our subsidiaries. The valuation allowance is considered on an individual entity basis. As of July 31, 2022 and 2021, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets are provided because we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that certain of the subsidiaries will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the near future, to realize the deferred tax assets carried-forwards.\nAs of July 31, 2022 and 2021, the total valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was $1,668,413 and $997,378, respectively.\nUncertain tax position\nIn order to assess uncertain tax positions, we apply a more likely than not threshold and a two-step approach for the tax position measurement and financial statement recognition. Under the two-step approach, the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. we recognize interest and penalties, if any, under accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and under other expenses in its consolidated statement of comprehensive loss. As of July 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not have any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions.\nFair value of trading securities\nWe measured our trading securities, which consisted of certain publicly-listed equity securities through various open market transactions, at market value. We reported a loss of $2,432,107 and $258,738 from investment in trading securities for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAs a smaller reporting company we are not required to provide the information required by this item. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe financial statements required by this item begin on page with the index to financial statements followed by the financial statements. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, which is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of July 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our management has concluded that, as of July 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file and furnish under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our conclusion is based on the fact that we do not have sufficient full-time accounting and financial reporting personnel with appropriate levels of accounting knowledge and experience to monitor the daily recording of transactions, to address complex U.S. GAAP accounting issues and the related disclosures under U.S. GAAP. In addition, there was a lack of sufficient documented financial closing procedure and a lack of risk assessment in accordance with COSCO 2013 framework. Our management is currently in the process of evaluating the steps necessary to remediate the ineffectiveness, such as (i) hiring more qualified accounting personnel with relevant U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience and qualifications to strengthen the financial reporting function and to set up a financial and system control framework, and (ii) implementing regular and continuous U.S. GAAP accounting and financial reporting training programs for our accounting and financial reporting personnel, and (iii) establishing an internal audit function and standardizing the Companys semi-annual and year-end closing and financial reporting processes.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. In assessing our internal control over financial reporting, prior to the offering in April 2019, we have been a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources to address our internal controls and procedures. Our independent registered public accounting firm, has not conducted an audit of our internal control over financial reporting. However, in connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended July 31, 2022, we identified four material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\n\u25cf We did not have sufficient personnel with appropriate levels of accounting knowledge and experience to address complex U.S. GAAP accounting issues and to prepare and review financial statements and related disclosures under U.S. GAAP. Specifically, our control did not operate effectively to ensure the appropriate and timely analysis of and accounting for unusual and non-routine transactions and certain financial statement accounts;\n\u25cf We have not established an internal control department and had a lack of adequate policies and procedures in internal audit function to ensure that our policies and procedures have been carried out as planned;\n\u25cf We have not established sufficient risk assessment in accordance with the requirement of COSCO 2013 Framework; and\n\u25cf We did not have sufficient documented financial closing policies and procedures.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, within the meaning of PCAOB Auditing Standard AS 2201, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have hired additional accounting staffs and are in the progress of improving our system security environment and conducting regular backup plan and penetration testing to ensure the network and information security. In addition, we plan to address the weaknesses identified above by implementing the following measures:\nFurthermore, we are in the process of implementing a number of measures to address the first to third material weakness that has been identified, including:\n1) hiring more qualified accounting personnel with relevant U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience and qualifications to strengthen the financial reporting function and to set up a financial and system control framework; and\n2) implementing regular and continuous U.S. GAAP accounting and financial reporting training programs for our accounting and financial reporting personnel.\nEspecially for the identified material weakness related to internal control, we will hire experts to improve and test our internal control and the set up a series of standard and recurring internal audit work procedures before July 2023. We schedule to will perform self-assessment of internal control effectiveness on a continuous basis, which will be led by our accounting and risk management department within year 2023. We will also hire more competent personnel and involve professional service companies to help us implement SOX 404 compliance together with the establishment of our internal audit function.\nHowever, we cannot assure you that we will remediate our material weaknesses in a timely manner.\nAttestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis annual report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting, as such report is not required due to the Companys status as a smaller reporting company.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nExcept as disclosed above, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

In considering related person transactions, our audit committee will take into account the relevant available facts and circumstances, which may include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf the risks, costs, and benefits to us;\n\u25cf the impact on a directors independence in the event the related person is a director, immediate family member of a director or an entity with which a director is affiliated;\n\u25cf the terms of the transaction;\n\u25cf the availability of other sources for comparable services or products;\n\u25cf the terms available to or from, as the case may be, unrelated third parties; and\n\u25cf our audit committee will approve only those transactions that it determines are fair and in our best interests.\nDirector Independence\nA majority of our Board of Directors are independent directors, see the discussion above under the section Item 10.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two- year period ended July 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nThe Companys ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operating activities. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements evaluation of the events and conditions and plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nATIF Holdings Limited (ATIF or the Company), formerly known as Eternal Fairy International Limited and Asia Times Holdings Limited, was incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (BVI) on January 5, 2015, as a holding company to develop business opportunities in the Peoples Republic of China (the PRC or China). The Company adopted its current name on March 7, 2019.\nATIF owns 100% equity interest of ATIF Limited (ATIF HK), formerly known as China Elite International Holdings Limited and Asia Times International Finance Limited, a limited liability company established in Hong Kong on January 6, 2015, and adopted its current name on March 7, 2019. ATIF HK acquired a financial and news media platform www.chinacnnm.com in September 2018.\nOn May 20, 2015, ATIF HK incorporated Huaya Consultant (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. (Huaya) as a Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise (WFOE) in China. On September 5, 2018, Huaya entered into a series of contractual arrangements with the owners of Qianhai Asia Era (Shenzhen) International Financial Service Co., Ltd. (Qianhai), a company incorporated on November 3, 2015, under the laws of China with a registered capital of RMB5 million (approximately $0.75 million), which had been fully funded in December 2017. Qianhai is primarily engaged in providing business advisory and financial consulting services to small and medium-sized enterprise customers in the PRC.\nQianhai originally owned a 100% controlled subsidiary Qianhai Asia Era (Shenzhen) International Fund Management Co., Ltd. (Asia Era Fund), which had limited operation since its inception on December 11, 2015. In connection with the reorganization of the legal structure for the initial public offering (IPO) of the Company, Asia Era Fund was spun off in two steps in August 2018 through September 2018.\nOn January 21, 2021, the Company incorporated ATIF-1 GP, LLC (ATIF GP) under the laws of Delaware of the United States. ATIF GP is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and focuses on fund management business.\nOn February 16, 2021, ATIF-1, LP (ATIF LP) was established as a private equity fund through our indirectly-wholly owned subsidiary, ATIF-1 GP, LLC (ATIF GP), a Delaware limited liability company, as the general partner. As of July 31, 2022, the Company owns 76.6% limited partner interest in ATIF, LP. The investment manager for the fund is ATIF Inc. ATIF LP manages approximately $1.3 million and $4.8 million assets under management (AUM) as of July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the year ended July 31, 2022, three limited partners of ATIF LP withdrew the investment of $3.0 million. In addition, the Company also paid investment gain of $29,149 to the limited partner, which was recorded as a reduction of non-controlling interest.\nOn December 22, 2021, ATIF Inc. incorporated ATIF BD LLC (ATIF BD) under the laws of California of the United States. On April 25, 2022, the Company incorporated ATIF Investment Limited (ATIF Investment) under the laws of BVI.\nDisposal of ATIF HK and Huaya\nOn May 20, 2022, the Company entered into a share transfer agreement with Mr. Pishan Chi, pursuant to which the Company transferred all of its equity interest in ATIF HK and its wholly owned subsidiary, Huaya to Mr. Chi at $nil consideration. Mr. Chi was the Companys former Chief Executive Officer for the period from July 10, 2020 through August 4, 2021. The transfer of equity interest was closed on May 31, 2022.\nThe transfer of equity interest in ATIF HK and Huaya was for the purpose of mitigation of restrictions on China-based companies raising capital offshore by the PRC government. Upon the transfer of ATIF HK and Huaya, the Company would continue its effort to provide financial consulting services to clients from North America and other areas. The management believed the disposition does not represent a strategic shift because it is not changing the way it is running its business. The Company has not shifted the nature of its operations, not is it exiting the North America market, which is the Companys major geographic market area. The termination is not accounted as discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 205-20 (see Note 6).\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS (continued)\nTermination of VIE agreements with Qianai\nOn February 3, 2021, the Company closed termination of its variable interest entity (VIE) agreements with Qianhai Asia Times (Shenzhen) International Financial Services Co., Ltd. (Qianhai). Upon the termination, Qianhai transferred all of its business and employees to Huaya, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The termination of the Qianhai VIE agreements did not contain any penalties or non-compete agreements.\nQianhai transferred all of its China-based business and employees to Huaya before termination of the VIE agreements. The termination of the VIE agreements did not discontinue our consulting service business because such services has been transferred to Huaya and ATIF Inc. to serve the clients located in China and the United States, respectively. The termination also did not cause material impairment of our long-lived assets (primarily including fixed assets such as office furniture and equipment and automobile) because all of the fixed assets have been transferred to our PRC subsidiary Huaya upon termination of the VIE agreements. The management believed the termination of Qianhai VIE agreements does not represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the Companys operations and financial results. The termination is not accounted as discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 205-20 (see Note 5).\nAcquisition of Leaping Group Co., Ltd. (LGC)\nOn April 22, 2020, the Company completed an acquisition of 51.2% of the equity interest of Leaping Group Co., Ltd. (LGC) from its original shareholders for a total consideration of approximately $22.92 million, including cash consideration of $1.85 million and issuance of 9,940,002 shares (1,988,000 ordinary shares retrospectively restated for accounting purposes for effect of reverse stock split on August 30, 2021) of ATIFs common stock with fair value of approximately $21.07 million (see Note 4). LGC, through its subsidiaries and similar VIE contractual agreements, controls Leaping Media Group Co., Ltd. (LMG), an operating entity located in Shenyang, China. LMG, along with its operating subsidiaries, is engaged in the multi-channel advertising business, event planning and execution business, film production business and movie theater operating business (collectively media business) in China. LMG used to be one of the Companys clients that sought business advisory services. Upon closing of the acquisition, ATIF owns 51.2% equity interest of LGC and hereby consolidates operations of LGC.\nDisposition of LGC\nOn January 29, 2021, the Company completed a disposition of 51.2% of the equity interest of LGC. The Company sold all of its shares of LGC to Jiang Bo, Jiang Tao and Wang Di (collectively, the Buyers) in exchange for (i) 5,555,548 ordinary shares (1,111,110 ordinary shares retrospectively restated for accounting purposes for effect of reverse stock split on August 30, 2021) of the Company owned by the Buyers and (ii) payment by the Buyers in the amount of $2,300,000 plus interest at an interest rate of 10% per annum on the unpaid amount if the principal amount of US$2,300,000 is not paid by January 14, 2022. All principal and accrued and unpaid interest shall be due on January 14, 2023. As of July 31, 2022, the principal and accrued and unpaid interest amounted to $2,654,767.\nIn accordance with ASC 205-20, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results when the components of an entity meets the criteria in paragraph 205-20-45-1E to be classified as held for sale. The disposition of LGC met the criteria in paragraph 205-20-45-1E and was reported as a discontinued operation (Note 4).\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 - LIQUIDITY and GOING CONCERN\nFor the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company reported a net loss from continuing operations of approximately $3.4 million and $2.4 million, respectively, and operating cash outflows from continuing operations of approximately $0.1 million and $2.5 million.\nIn assessing the Companys ability to continue as a going concern, the Company monitors and analyzes its cash and its ability to generate sufficient cash flow in the future to support its operating and capital expenditure commitments.\nAs of July 31, 2022, the Company had cash of $1.8 million. On the other hand, the Company had current liabilities of $2.8 million. Currently the Company had three service-in-progress agreements, and expected to collect consulting service fees of $2.5 million for the next 12 months. The Company also had $2.7 million receivable from buyers of LGC in connection with the disposal of LGC which will be due in early 2023. In addition, due to the recent intense relationship between the U.S. and China, which has become more fragile as a result of the outbreak and spread of COVID-19, plus the tightening of U.S. legislation and public listing rules to curb some small Chinese companies to access the U.S. capital markets, an increasing number of Chinese companies are putting off or slowing down their plans for U.S. listings due to these uncertainties. Furthermore, due to the impact of COVID-19, some of our existing customers may experience financial distress or business disruptions, which could lead to potential delay or default on their payments. Any increased difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, or early termination of our existing consulting service agreements due to deterioration in economic conditions could further negatively impact our cash flows. Given these factors, our potential customers perception and confidence to go public in the United States has been negatively impacted and our operating revenue and cash flows may continue to underperform in the near terms. Although we had cash of $1.8 million as of July 31, 2022, given the above mentioned uncertainties, the management believes that the Company will continue as a going concern in the following 12 months from the date the Companys 2022 consolidated financial statements are issued.\nWe believe that our existing cash, together with $3.2 million that currently remains available under our $8.0 million revolving line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB Credit Facility), and $4.0 million available under the subordinated line of credit (Subordinated LOC) as of September 12, 2022, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital resources to fund planned operations for the next twelve (12) months.\nCurrently, the Company intends to finance its future working capital requirements and capital expenditures from cash generated from operating activities and funds raised from equity financings. In October 2021, the Company raised proceeds of $1.1 million from exercise of warrants to purchase 389,855 of its ordinary shares by warrant holders who subscribed for ordinary shares in the registered direct offering closed in November 2020.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above.\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements of the Company also include the accounts of ATIF LP, for which the Company is an investment manager and has primary beneficiary over the ATIF LP. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nAs of July 31, 2022, the Companys consolidated financial statements reflect the operating results of the following entities:\nName of Entity\nDate of\nIncorporation\nPlace of\nIncorporation\n% of\nOwnership\nPrincipal Activities\nParent company:\nATIF Holdings Limited (ATIF)\nJanuary 5, 2015\nBritish Virgin Islands\nParent\nInvestment holding\nWholly owned subsidiaries of ATIF\nATIF Inc.

Before the termination of the Qianhai VIE agreements on February 3, 2021 (see Note 5) and disposition of LGC on January 31, 2021 (see Note 4), the Company was still operating under the VIE structure and the Companys main operating entities Qianhai and LMG are controlled through contractual arrangements in lieu of direct equity ownership by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation (continued)\nRisks associated with the VIE structure\nThe Company believes that the contractual arrangements with its VIEs and respective shareholders are in compliance with PRC laws and regulations and are legally enforceable. However, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit the Companys ability to enforce the contractual arrangements. If the legal structure and contractual arrangements were found to be in violation of PRC laws and regulations, the PRC government could:\n\u25cf revoke the business and operating licenses of the Companys PRC subsidiary and VIEs;\n\u25cf discontinue or restrict the operations of any related-party transactions between the Companys PRC subsidiary and VIEs;\n\u25cf limit the Companys business expansion in China by way of entering into contractual arrangements;\n\u25cf impose fines or other requirements with which the Companys PRC subsidiary and VIEs may not be able to comply;\n\u25cf require the Company or the Companys PRC subsidiary and VIEs to restructure the relevant ownership structure or operations; or\n\u25cf restrict or prohibit the Companys use of the proceeds from the IPO to finance the Companys business and operations in China.\nThe Companys ability to conduct its consulting services business may be negatively affected if the PRC government were to carry out of any of the aforementioned actions. As a result, the Company may not be able to consolidate its VIEs in its consolidated financial statements as it may lose the ability to exert effective control over the VIEs and its respective shareholders and it may lose the ability to receive economic benefits from its VIEs. The Company, however, does not believe such actions would result in the liquidation or dissolution of the Company, its PRC subsidiary, or its VIEs.\nThe Company has not provided any financial support to the VIEs for the years ended July 31, 2021.\nBecause the Company terminated Qianhai VIE agreements on February 3, 2021 (see Note 5) and disposed of LGC on January 31, 2021 (Note 4), the Company had no balances of VIEs included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of July 31, 2022 and 2021.\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation (continued)\nThe follow table summarized operating results of the VIEs for the period from August 1, 2021 through VIE termination date.\nFor the\nperiod from\nAugust 1,\nthrough\nFebruary 3, 2021 For the\nperiod from\nAugust 1,\nthrough\nJanuary 31, 2021\nQianhai VIE LMG VIE Total\nOperating revenue $ 380,954 $ 2,117,551 $ 2,498,505\nIncome (loss) from operations $ (60,242 ) $ (1,154,067 ) $ (1,214,309 )\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ (63,765 ) $ (1,166,287 ) $ (1,230,052 )\nNet income (loss) $ (63,765 ) $ (1,142,160 ) $ (1,205,925 )\nThe follow table summarized cash flow information of the VIEs for the period from August 1, 2021 through VIE termination date.\nFor the\nperiod from\nAugust 1,\nthrough\nFebruary 3, 2021 For the\nperiod from\nAugust 1,\nthrough\nJanuary 31, 2021\nQianhai VIE LMG VIE Total\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (286,657 ) $ (119,612 ) $ (406,269 )\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ -\n$ 118,541 $ 118,541\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ -\n$ -\n$ -\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nNoncontrolling Interests\nAs of July 31, 2022 and 2021, the non-controlling interest represent minority shareholders 76.6% and 68.8% ownership interest in ATIF LP, over which the Company had 23.4% and 31.2% ownership interest and acted as an investment manager through ATIF GP, its wholly owned subsidiary. The Company had non-controlling interest of $(369,045) and $120,809 as of July 31, 2022 and 2021.\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based on information as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates required to be made by management include, but are not limited to, the valuation of accounts receivable, useful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets, the recoverability of long-lived assets, revenue recognition, provision necessary for contingent liabilities and realization of deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash includes cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts maintained with commercial banks. The Company considers all highly liquid investment instruments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains most of its bank accounts in the PRC.\nAccounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company usually determines the adequacy of reserves for doubtful accounts based on individual account analysis and historical collection trends. The Company establishes a provision for doubtful receivables when there is objective evidence that the Company may not be able to collect amounts due. The allowance is based on managements best estimates of specific losses on individual exposures, as well as a provision on historical trends of collections. The provision is recorded against accounts receivables balances, with a corresponding charge recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Delinquent account balances are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable. As of July 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no allowance against doubtful accounts receivable.\nInvestment in Trading Securities\nEquity securities not accounted for using the equity method are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, according to ASC 321 Investments - Equity Securities. During the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company purchased certain publicly-listed equity securities through various open market transactions and accounted for such investments as investment in trading securities and subsequently measure the investments at fair value. The Company made a loss of $2,432,107 and $258,738 from investment in trading securities for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021.\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nProperty and Equipment, net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. The straight-line depreciation method is used to compute depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:\nUseful life\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment 3-5 years\nTransportation vehicles 5 years\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs, which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets, are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments which substantially extend the useful life of assets are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as other income or expenses.\nLong-term investments\nIn accordance with ASC 321-10 Investments - Equity Securities, the Company elects to record equity investments in a privately held company, over which the Company did not have control or exercise significant influence, using the measurement alternative at cost, less impairment, with subsequent adjustments for observable price changes resulting from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer.\nEquity investment in a privately held company accounted for using the measurement alternative is subject to periodic impairment reviews. The Companys impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant effect on the fair value of these equity securities, including consideration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs of July 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not record impairment loss against the long-term investments.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, including plant and equipment and intangible with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant adverse change to market conditions that will impact the future use of the assets) indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate and recognize an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset. If an impairment is identified, the Company would reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flows approach or, when available and appropriate, to comparable market values.\nFor the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not record impairment against long-lived assets from its continuing operations, respectively.\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nASC 825-10 requires certain disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\n\u25cf Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n\u25cf Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted market prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\n\u25cf Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable.\nFair value of investment in trading securities are based on quoted prices in active markets. The carrying amounts of the Companys other financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, deposits, due from buyers of LGC and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. For lease liabilities, fair value approximates their carrying value at the year-end as the interest rates used to discount the host contracts approximate market rates.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606).\nTo determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when it transfers its goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in such exchange.\nThe Company currently generates its revenue from the following main sources:\n(1) Revenue from customers initial registration fee\nIn order to engage with the Company for various consulting services, a new customer is required to pay an initial non-refundable registration fee to the Company and the Company will then post the customers information and profiles on its website, at which point, the Companys performance obligations are satisfied and such registration fee is recognized as revenue. The Company does not charge additional customer profile maintenance fee after the initial posting is completed as limited effort is required for the Company to maintain such information on an on-going basis. No revenues were generated from customers initial registration for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021.\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nRevenue Recognition (continued)\n(2) Revenue from consulting services\nThe Company provides various consulting services to its members, especially to those who have the intention to be publicly listed in the stock exchanges in the United States and other countries. The Company categorizes its consulting services into three Phases:\nPhase I consulting services primarily include due diligence review, market research and feasibility study, business plan drafting, accounting record review, and business analysis and recommendations. Management estimates that Phase I normally takes about three months to complete based on its past experience.\nPhase II consulting services primarily include reorganization, pre-listing education and tutoring, talent search, legal and audit firm recommendation and coordination, VIE contracts and other public-listing related documents review, merger and acquisition planning, investor referral and pre-listing equity financing source identification and recommendations, and independent directors and audit committee candidates recommendation. Management estimates that Phase II normally takes about eight months to complete based on its past experience.\nPhase III consulting services primarily include shell company identification and recommendation for customers expecting to become publicly listed through reverse merger transaction; assistance in preparation of customers public filings for IPO or reverse merger transactions; and assistance in answering comments and questions received from regulatory agencies. Management believes it is very difficult to estimate the timing of this phase of service as the completion of Phase III services is not within the Companys control.\nEach phase of consulting services is stand-alone and fees associated with each phase are clearly identified in service agreements. Revenue from providing Phase I and Phase II consulting services to customers is recognized ratably over the estimated completion period of each phase as the Companys performance obligations related to these services are carried out over the whole duration of each Phase. Revenue from providing Phase III consulting services to customers is recognized upon completion of the reverse merger transaction or IPO transaction when the Companys promised services are rendered and the Companys performance obligations are satisfied. Revenue that has been billed and not yet recognized is reflected as deferred revenue on the balance sheet.\nDepending on the complexity of the underlying service arrangement and related terms and conditions, significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates may be required to determine when substantial delivery of contract elements has occurred, whether any significant ongoing obligations exist subsequent to contract execution, whether amounts due are collectible and the appropriate period or periods in which, or during which, the completion of the earnings process occurs. Depending on the magnitude of specific revenue arrangements, adjustment may be made to the judgments, assumptions, and estimates regarding contracts executed in any specific period.\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nRevenue Recognition (continued)\nRevenue from LGC\nBefore the disposal of 51.2% equity interest in LGC, the Company generated revenue from Multi-Channel advertising, Event planning and execution, Movie Theater Operating and others. The revenues from these revenue streams were classified as a component of net loss from discontinued operations upon the close of the disposition. See Note 4.\n(1) Multi-Channel advertising\nThe Companys multi-channel advertising services include pre-movie advertisements display, elevator and supermarket advertising, and brand promotion. Most of the Companys client contracts are individually negotiated and, accordingly, the service period and prices vary significantly. Service periods typically range from one day to one year.\nThe Company provides advertising services over the contract period. Revenues from advertising services are recognized on straight-line basis over the contract period, which approximates the pattern of when the underlying services are performed. Prepayments for advertising services are deferred and recognized as revenue when the advertising services are rendered and the Companys performance obligations are satisfied.\nThe Company also provides advertising services through its regional distributors. Pursuant to advertising services distribution agreements, the Company grants the regional distributors the exclusive rights to provide local pre-movie advertising. The advertising services distribution agreements with these regional distributors typically have terms ranging from 11 to 24 months without automatic renewal provisions. Under the advertising services distribution agreements, the Company has the right to set the minimum local pre-movie advertisement prices in the movie theaters, regulate the content and quality of local pre-movie advertisements according to related laws and movie theater rules, and examine the source of local pre-movie advertisements and refuse to display advertisements from any competitors. The receipt of distribution fee is initially recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as revenue ratably as services are rendered and the Companys performance obligations are satisfied.\n(2) Event planning and execution\nThe Companys event planning and execution business includes planning and arrangement of events, and production of related advertising materials. From the preparation of the events to executing it typically takes no more than one week. Revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with the client arrangement and upon the completion of the earnings process.\n(3) Movie Theater Operating\nThe Companys movie theater operating revenues are generated primarily from box office admissions and theater food and beverage sales. Revenues of this business line are recognized when admissions and food and beverage sales are rendered at the theaters and are reported net of sales tax. The Company defers 100% of the revenue associated with the sales of gift cards and packaged tickets until such time as the items are redeemed.\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nRevenue Recognition (continued)\nFor the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, the disaggregation of revenues from continuing operations and discontinued operations was as below:\nFor the Years Ended\nJuly 31,\nConsulting service revenue from continuing operations* $ 1,626,102 $ 936,935\nOther service revenues 41,208 -\nRevenues from continuing operations $ 1,667,310 $ 936,935\nRevenue from discontinued operations (multi-channel advertising, event planning and execution and movie theater operation business under LGC) $ -\n$ 2,117,551\n* The revenues generated by Qianhai, ATIF HK and Huaya were included in consulting service revenue from continuing operations, because the termination of Qianhai VIE agreement and share transfer of ATIF HK and Huaya were not accounted as discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 205-20 (see Note 5 and Note 6).\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period including the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nAn uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. Penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the period incurred. The Company did not have unrecognized uncertain tax positions or any unrecognized liabilities, interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefit as of July 31, 2022. As of July 31, 2022, all of the Companys income tax returns for the tax years ended December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2021 remain open for statutory examination by relevant tax authorities.\nValue Added Tax (VAT)\nSales revenue derived from advertising service revenues is subject to VAT. The applicable VAT rate for the Company is 3% for Huaya. All of the VAT returns of the Company have been and remain subject to examination by the tax authorities for five years from the date of filing.\nLoss per Share\nThe Company computes loss per share (EPS) in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share (ASC 260). ASC 260 requires companies with complex capital structures to present basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured as net loss divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of potential common shares (e.g., convertible securities, options and warrants) as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date, if later. Potential common shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS. For the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no dilutive shares.\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency for ATIF is the U.S Dollar (US$\"). ATIF HK uses Hong Kong dollar as its functional currency, and Huaya uses RMB as its functional currency. For the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company primarily operates its business through ATIF Inc, ATIF HK and Huaya, and the latter two entities were disposed of on May 31, 2022. For the year ended July 31, 2021, the Company operates its business through ATIF HK and Huaya.\nThe Companys consolidated financial statements have been translated into US$.\nAssets and liabilities accounts are translated using the exchange rate at each reporting period end date. Equity accounts are translated at historical rates. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange during the reporting period. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses resulting from the translations of foreign currency transactions and balances are reflected in the results of operations.\nThe RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currency and all foreign exchange transactions must take place through authorized institutions. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US$ at the rates used in translation.\nThe following table outlines the currency exchange rates that were used in creating the consolidated financial statements in this report:\nMay 31, 2022 July 31, 2021\nForeign currency Period-end\nspot rate Average rate Period-end\nspot rate Average rate\nRMB: 1USD 0.1499 0.1555 0.1547 0.1521\nHKD: 1USD 0.1282 0.1282 0.1282 0.1282\nComprehensive loss\nComprehensive loss consists of two components, net loss and other comprehensive income (loss).\nThe foreign currency translation gain or loss resulting from translation of the financial statements expressed in RMB to US$ is reported in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nOperating Leases\nThe Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02-Leases (Topic 842) since August 1, 2019, using a modified retrospective transition method permitted under ASU No. 2018-11. This transition approach provides a method for recording existing leases only at the date of adoption and does not require previously reported balances to be adjusted. In addition, the Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed the Company to carry forward the historical lease classification. The standard did not materially impact the consolidated net earnings and cash flows.\nUpon adoption of ASC 842, the lease liabilities are recognized upon lease commencement for operating leases based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. As the rates implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, the incremental borrowing rates at the lease commencement date are used in determining the imputed interest and present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rates were determined using a portfolio approach based on the rates of interest that the Company would have to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company recognizes the single lease cost on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term for operating leases.\nThe Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less; expenses for these leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nStatement of Cash Flows\nIn accordance with ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, cash flows from the Companys operations are formulated based upon the local currencies. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheets.\nDiscontinued operation\nIn accordance with ASC 205-20, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results when the components of an entity meets the criteria in paragraph 205-20-45-1E to be classified as held for sale. When all of the criteria to be classified as held for sale are met, including management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the entity, the major current assets, other assets, current liabilities, and noncurrent liabilities shall be reported as components of total assets and liabilities separate from those balances of the continuing operations. At the same time, the results of all discontinued operations, less applicable income taxes (benefit), shall be reported as components of net loss separate from the net loss of continuing operations in accordance with ASC 205-20-45.\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nSegment reporting\nThe Company had four operating business lines, including Business Advisory and Consulting Services, Multi-channel Advertising Services, Event Planning and Execution Services and Movie Theater Operation Services. However, due to changes in our organizational structure associated with the LGC, which engaged in Multi-channel Advertising Services, Event Planning and Execution Services and Movie Theater Operation Services, as a discontinued operation (Note 4 - Discontinued operation), management has determined that the Company now operates in one operating segment with one reporting segment as of July 31, 2022 and 2021, which is the consulting service business.\nReclassification\nCertain items in the financial statements of comparative period have been reclassified to conform to the financial statements for the current period, primarily for the effects of discontinued operations of LGC (see Note 4 for detail) and reverse split of the Companys ordinary shares (see Note 16 for detail).\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business, which cover a wide range of matters. Liabilities for contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated.\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss is incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability is accrued in the Companys financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.\nLoss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed.\nRisks and Uncertainty\n(a) Credit risk\nSubstantially all of the Companys operating activities are transacted in RMB, which is not freely convertible into foreign currencies. All foreign exchange transactions take place either through the Peoples Bank of China or other banks authorized to buy and sell foreign currencies at the exchange rates quoted by the Peoples Bank of China. Approval of foreign currency payments by the Peoples Bank of China or other regulatory institutions requires submitting a payment application form together with suppliers invoices, shipping documents and signed contracts.\nAs of July 31, 2022, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $203,403 deposited in the banks located in the U.S., which were insured by FDIC up to $250,000, and held cash and cash equivalents of $1,546,734 deposited in the investment bank accounts located in the U.S. which are not insured by FDIC.\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\n(b) Concentration risk\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and derived from revenue earned from customers, thereby exposed to credit risk. The risk is mitigated by the Companys assessment of its customers creditworthiness and its ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances.\nThe Company has a concentration of its revenues and receivables with specific customers. For the year ended July 31, 2022, three customers accounted for 46%, 30% and 22% of the Companys consolidated revenue, respectively. For the year ended July 31, 2021, three customers accounted for 41%, 41% and 11% of the Companys consolidated revenue, respectively.\nFor the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, substantially all of the Companys revenues was generated from providing going public related consulting services to customers. The risk is mitigated by the Companys plan to transition its consulting services from the PRC based customers to more international customers.\n(c) Other risks and uncertainties\nThe Companys business, financial condition and results of operations may also be negatively impacted by risks related to natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, health epidemics and other catastrophic incidents, which could significantly disrupt the Companys operations.\nThe Companys operations have been affected by the outbreak and spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which in March 2020, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 outbreak is causing lockdowns, travel restrictions, and closures of businesses. The Companys businesses have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak to a certain extent.\nDue to the outbreak of COVID-19, in early February 2020, the Chinese government required the nationwide closure of many business activities in the PRC to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect public health. While the outbreak of COVID-19 has come under control in the PRC since the second quarter of 2020, there was a significant rise in COVID-19 cases, including the COVID-19 Delta and Omicron variant cases, in various cities in China in early 2022. The local governments of the affected cities, including certain first-tier cities in China, have reinstated certain COVID-related measures, including travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders.\nSome of the Companys existing customers have experienced financial distress and disruption of business, which resulted in delay or default on their payments.\nNevertheless, the continued uncertainties associated with COVID 19 may cause the Companys revenue and cash flows to underperform in the next 12 months. A resurgence could negatively affect the execution of the going public consulting service agreements and the collection of the payments from customers. The extent of the future impact of COVID-19 is still highly uncertain and cannot be predicted as of the financial statement reporting date.\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 was subsequently amended by Accounting Standards Update 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Accounting Standards Update 2019-04 Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments, and Accounting Standards Update 2019-05, Targeted Transition Relief. For public entities, ASU 2016-13 and its amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. For all other entities, this guidance and its amendments will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. As an emerging growth company, the Company plans to adopt this guidance effective August 1, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2019-10). ASU 2019-10 (i) provides a framework to stagger effective dates for future major accounting standards and (ii) amends the effective dates for certain major new accounting standards to give implementation relief to certain types of entities.

Clients located within United States will be serviced by ATIF Inc., while clients outside United States will be supported by ATIF Inc.s business center abroad. Huaya Consultant (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. (Huaya), a wholly owned subsidiary of ATIF, will serve as ATIF Inc.s business center in PRC for clients located in the PRC. Huaya ceased to be the wholly owned subsidiary since May 31, 2022. As part of streamlining the management chain and to improve management control with a goal of lower costs, the Company transitioned the services from Qianhai to ATIF Inc. and Huaya and closed termination of the VIE agreements with Qianhai on February 3, 2021. The termination of the Qianhai VIE agreement did not discontinue the Companys public listing related consulting service business, because such consulting service business has been transferred to Huaya to serve the client located in China and ATIF Inc. to serve the clients located within the United States. There were no penalties or non-compete agreements derived from the termination of the Qianhai VIE agreements.\nQianhai transferred all of its China-based business and employees to Huaya before termination of the VIE agreement. The termination of the VIE agreement did not cause material impairment of our long-lived assets (primarily including fixed assets such as office furniture and equipment and automobile) because all of the fixed assets have been transferred to our PRC subsidiary Huaya upon termination of the VIE agreement and there were no assets held for sale or disposal.\nPrior to the termination, operating revenue generated through Qianhai VIE amounted to $645,127, and net loss amounted to $(1,562,037) for the year ended July 31, 2020, respectively, and net assets of Qianhai VIE amounted to $1,147,847 as of July 31, 2020. As of the date of termination, Qianhai had total assets of $266,235 and total liabilities of $656,417, with a negative net assets of $0.4 million, the abstract amount accounted for 4% of the consolidated net assets of the Company as of July 31, 2021. In addition, Qianhai generated net income of approximately $0.4 million, the abstract amount of which accounted for 5% of consolidated net loss for the year ended July 31, 2021. The Company recorded a gain of $390,183 from the termination in the account of other income (expenses), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nThe management believed the termination of Qianhai VIE agreements does not represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the Companys operations and financial results. The termination is not accounted as discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 205-20.\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 6 - TRANSFER OF EQUITY INTEREST IN ATIF HK AND HUAYA\nTo mitigate the potential risks arising from the PRC government provision of new guidance to and restrictions on China-based companies raising capital offshore, the Company closed transfer of equity interest in ATIF HK and Huaya with Mr. Pishan Chi for nil consideration on May 31, 2022. The disposition of ATIF HK and Huaya did not discontinue the Companys public listing related consulting service business, as the Company would focus it continuous efforts on provision consulting service business to clients based in North America and other areas. There were no penalties or non-compete agreements derived from the disposition.\nFor the period from August 1, 2021 through May 31, 2022, operating revenue generated through ATIF HK and Huaya amounted to $864,102, and net loss amounted to $(871,958), respectively. The revenues and net loss accounted for 52% and 26%, respectively, of consolidated revenue and net loss for the year ended July 31, 2022.

The Company also determines the transfer of equity interest does not represent a strategic shift because it is not changing the way the Company operates its consulting services. The Company does not shift the nature of its business, not does it exit North America market, which is the major geographic market area of the Companys business. The termination is not accounted as discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 205-20.\nThe Company recorded a gain of $1,043,052 from the transfer of equity interest as a component of other income (expenses), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nNOTE 7 - PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets from the Companys continuing operations consisted of the following:\nAs of July 31,\nPrepayment for advertising service fee (a) $ 600,000 $ 600,000\nPrepaid service fees - 20,000\nPrepaid insurance service fee - 58,151\nAdvance to vendors 10,000 10,000\nOthers 41,210\nTotal $ 651,210 $ 688,451\n(a) Prepayment for advertising services represent the advance payments made by the Company to a third party advertising company for producing advertising contents.

The federal tax rate is 21% and state tax rate is 8.84%. The Company also evaluated the impact from the recent tax reforms in the United States, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) and Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act (HERO Act), which both were passed in 2020, no material impact on the Company is expected based on the analysis. The Company will continue to monitor the potential impact going forward.\nFor the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, no current and deferred income tax expenses were associated with the Companys continuing operations.\nThe following table reconciles the statutory federal rate of 21% for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021 to the Companys effective tax rate associated with the Companys continuing operations:\nFor the Years Ended\nJuly 31,\n% %\nStatutory federal rate 21.0 21.0\nState tax rate, net of statutory federal effect 8.8 8.8\nRate differential (16.2 ) (29.5 )\nPermanent difference on non-deductible expenses 0.0 0.0\nUtilization of the Net Operating Loss (NOL) from prior years 0. 1.3\nChange in valuation allowance (13.6 ) (1.6 )\nEffective tax rate 0.0 0.0\nDeferred tax assets\nThe Companys deferred tax assets associated with its continuing operations are comprised of the following:\nAs of July 31,\nDeferred tax assets:\nAllowance for doubtful account $ 105,059 $ 105,059\nNet operating loss carry forwards 1,563,354 664,208\nDeferred tax assets before valuation allowance 1,668,413 769,267\nLess: valuation allowance (1,668,413 ) (769,267 )\nNet deferred tax assets $ -\n$ -\nThe Company follows ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates, applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 15 - TAXES (continued)\nThe Companys deferred tax assets primarily derived from the net operating loss (NOL) and allowance for doubtful accounts. For the year ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company suffered net operating losses due to reduced number of customers for ATIFs consulting service. The Company periodically evaluates the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduces the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent it believes a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of the deferred tax assets, including its recent cumulative earnings experience, expectation of future income, the carry forward periods available for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. As of July 31, 2022 and 2021, management believes that the realization of the deferred tax assets appears to be uncertain and may not be realizable in the near future. Therefore, a 100% valuation allowance has been provided against the deferred tax assets.\n(c) Taxes Payable\nThe Companys taxes payable from its continuing operations consists of the following:\nAs of July 31,\nValue added tax payable $ -\n$ 18,104\nIncome tax payable -\n39,253\nOther taxes payable -\nTotal taxes payable $ -\n$ 58,017\nUncertain tax positions\nThe Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized and recorded as necessary in the provision for income taxes. The Company is subject to income taxes in the PRC. According to the PRC Tax Administration and Collection Law, the statute of limitations is three years if the underpayment of taxes is due to computational errors made by the taxpayer or the withholding agent. The statute of limitations is extended to five years under special circumstances, where the underpayment of taxes is more than RMB 100,000. In the case of transfer pricing issues, the statute of limitation is ten years. There is no statute of limitation in the case of tax evasion. There were no uncertain tax positions as of July 31, 2022 and 2021 and the Company does not believe that its unrecognized tax benefits will change over the next twelve months.\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 16 - EQUITY\nOrdinary Shares\nThe Company was incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands on January 5, 2015.

Appropriations to the statutory surplus reserve are required to be at least 10% of the after-tax net income determined in accordance with PRC GAAP until the reserve is equal to 50% of the entitys registered capital. Appropriations to the discretionary surplus reserve are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The statutory reserve may be applied against prior year losses, if any, and may be used for general business expansion and production or increase in registered capital, but are not distributable as cash dividends.\nThe payment of dividends by entities organized in China is subject to limitations, procedures and formalities. Regulations in the PRC currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with accounting standards and regulations in China. The results of operations reflected in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S GAAP may differ from those in the statutory financial statements of the WFOEs and VIEs. Remittance of dividends by a wholly foreign-owned company out of China is subject to examination by the banks designated by State Administration of Foreign Exchange.\nIn light of the foregoing restrictions, Huaya is restricted in its ability to transfer their net assets to the Company. Foreign exchange and other regulations in the PRC may further restrict its subsidiary in the PRC from transferring funds to the Company in the form of dividends, loans and advances.\nAs of July 31, 2021, the restricted amounts as determined pursuant to PRC statutory laws totaled $355,912 and total restricted net assets from the Companys continuing operations amounted to $962,374, respectively.\nAs of July 31, 2022, the statutory reserve balance was $355,912, and total restricted net assets of the Company was $nil due to the disposal of Huaya in May 2022 (Note 6).\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 17 - CONTIGENCIES\nFrom time to time, the Company is a party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues costs associated with these matters when they become probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred.\nPending Legal Proceeding with Boustead Securities, LLC (Boustead)\nOn May 14, 2020, Boustead filed a lawsuit against the Company and LGC for breaching the underwriting agreement Boustead had with each of the Company and LGC, in which Boustead was separately engaged as the exclusive financial advisor to provide financial advisory services to the Company and LGC.\nIn April 2020, the Company acquired 51.2% equity interest in LGC after LGC terminated its efforts to launch an IPO on its own. Boustead alleged that the acquisition transaction between the Company and LGC was entered into during the lockup period of the exclusive agreement between Boustead and LGC, and therefore deprived Boustead of compensation that Boustead would otherwise have been entitled to receive under its exclusive agreement with LGC. Therefore, Boustead is attempting to recover from the Company an amount equal to a percentage of the value of the transaction it conducted with LGC.\nBousteads Complaint alleges four causes of action against the Company, including breach of contract; breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; tortious interference with business relationships and quantum meruit.\nOn October 6, 2020, ATIF filed a motion to dismiss Bousteads Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(5). On October 9, 2020, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York directed Boustead to respond to the motion or amend its Complaint by November 10, 2020. Boustead opted to amend its complaint and filed the amended complaint on November 10, 2020. Bousteads amended complaint asserts the same four causes of action against ATIF and LGC as its original complaint. The Company filed another motion to dismiss Bousteads amended complaint on December 8, 2020.\nOn August 25, 2021, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted ATIFs motion to dismiss Bousteads first amended complaint. In its order and opinion, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York allowed Boustead to move for leave to amend its causes of action against ATIF as to breach of contract and tortious interference with business relationships, but not breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and quantum meruit. On November 4, 2021, Boustead filed a motion seeking leave to file a second amended complaint to amend its cause of action for Breach of Contract. The Court granted Bousteads motion for leave and Boustead filed the second amended complaint on December 28, 2021 alleging only breach of contract and dropping all other causes of action alleged in the original complaint. On January 18, 2022, the Company filed a motion to dismiss Bousteads second amended complaint. Boustead filed its opposition on February 1, 2022 and the Company replied on February 8, 2022.\nOn July 6, 2022, the Court denied our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. Thereafter, on August 3, 2022, the Company filed a motion to compel arbitration of Bousteads claims in California. Briefing on the Companys motion to compel concluded on August 23, 2022. The Court has yet to rule on that motion. Boustead is also seeking a default judgment against LGC and recently filed an order to show cause for default judgment against LGC. The Court has not ruled on Bousteads request for entry of default judgment against LGC.\nATIF is currently evaluating how it will respond to Bousteads motion for leave. In sum, the Boustead litigation is currently in the pleadings stage. Our management believes it is premature to assess and predict the outcome of this pending litigation.\nATIF HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 18 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nEnter into a new consulting agreement with a customer\nOn August 12, 2022, the Company entered into a consulting agreement (the Consulting Agreement) with Massimo Motor Sports, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (Massimo) and with an effective date of August 10, 2022.
