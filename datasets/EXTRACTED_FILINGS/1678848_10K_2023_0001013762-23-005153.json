    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nRegulatory Overview - Summary Legal and Operational Risks\nCambell International Holding Corp., formerly known as Bitmis Corp. (the Company) is not a Chinese operating company but rather a Nevada holding company with no operations of its own. We conduct our operations through Baijiakang (Liaoning) Health Information Consulting Service Cop. Ltd. (Baijiakang Consulting), our wholly foreign-owned enterprise (WFOE), which conducts its operations through contractual agreements with a variable interest entity (VIE), Liaoning Kangbaier Biotechnology Development Co. Ltd. (Liaoning Kangbaier), and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Doron Kangbaier Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (Doron) and Liaoning Baijiakang Health Technology Co. Ltd. (Liaoning), as discussed in greater detail below. See -Corporate History and Structure - Contractual Arrangements, below.\nThe VIE structure involves unique risks to shareholders and investors. It is used to provide investors with contractual exposure to foreign investment in China-based companies where Chinese law prohibits or restricts direct foreign investment in the operating companies. Due to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership in certain businesses, we do not have any equity ownership of the VIE or its subsidiary; instead, we receive the economic benefits of the VIEs business operations through certain contractual arrangements.\nAs a result of such series of contractual arrangements, Baijiakang Consulting is the primary beneficiary of the VIE for accounting purposes and the VIE is a PRC consolidated entity under U.S. GAAP. The Company consolidates the financial results of the VIE and its subsidiaries in its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Neither the Company nor its investors own any equity interest in, have direct foreign investment in, or control the VIE through any such ownership or investment. As a result, investors in the Companys common stock are not purchasing an equity interest in the VIE or in its subsidiary, but instead are purchasing an equity interest in KPIL, the Nevada holding company. These contractual arrangements have not been tested in a court of law in the PRC.\nSummary Risks Related to our VIE Structure\n\u25cf PRC laws and regulations prohibit or restrict foreign ownership of companies that operate Internet information and content, value added telecommunications, and certain other businesses in which we are engaged or could be deemed to be engaged. Consequently, our operations and business in the PRC are conducted through contractual arrangements (VIE Agreements) with Liaoning Kangbaier. If the Chinese government should disallow or limit the use of the VIE, it could materially and adversely affect our business, which could result in your shares significantly declining in value or becoming worthless.\n\u25cf Although we believe that the ownership structures of our PRC subsidiary and the Liaoning Kangbaier VIE in China do not violate any applicable PRC law, regulation, or rule currently in effect and that the VIE Agreements are valid, binding, and enforceable in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws and regulations currently in effect, but that such ownership structures have not been tested in court, we face uncertainty with respect to future actions by the PRC government that could significantly affect the enforceability of the VIE Agreements, Baijiakang Consultings financial performance, and the value of our shareholders shares of common stock.\n\u25cf Although the PRCs Ministry of Commerce and its National Development and Reform Commission have announced new edicts regarding the use of VIEs for new overseas offerings, they have indicated that such new requirements will not affect the foreign ownership of companies already listed overseas. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that such new rules and regulations will not be applied retroactively which may have a substantial negative impact on our business and consequently on the value of our securities.\n\u25cf On March 15, 2019, the National Peoples Congress promulgated the Foreign Investment Law, which took effect on January 1, 2020. Since it is relatively new, substantial uncertainties exist in relation to its interpretation and implementation including future laws, administrative regulations, or provisions of the State Council to provide for contractual arrangements as a form of foreign investment. Therefore, it is uncertain whether our contractual arrangements would be deemed to be in violation of the market access requirements for foreign investment in the PRC, and if they are deemed to be in violation, how our contractual arrangements should be dealt with.\n\u25cf Neither the Company nor its shareholders have a direct equity ownership interest in Baijiakang Consulting, our WFOE, or Liaoning Kangbaier, the VIE. The Companys relationship to the VIE is defined by the VIE Agreements. Therefore, should the Chinese government disallow or limit the use of the VIE, it could result in your shares significantly declining in value or becoming worthless.\nSummary Risks Associated with Doing Business in China\n\u25cf Regulatory authorities in China have recently implemented regulations concerning privacy and data protection and more stringent laws and regulations may be introduced in China. The PRC Cybersecurity Law provides that personal information and important data collected and generated by operators of critical information infrastructure in the course of their operations in the PRC should be stored in the PRC, and the law imposes heightened regulation and additional security obligations on operators of critical information infrastructure. The Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021) stipulate that operators of critical information infrastructure purchasing network products and services and online platform operators (together with the operators of critical information infrastructure, the Operators) carrying out data processing activities that affect or may affect national security shall conduct a cybersecurity review, and any online platform operator who controls more than one million users personal information must go through a cybersecurity review by the cybersecurity review office if it seeks to be listed in a foreign country. We do not believe that our Company constitutes an Operator pursuant to the Cybersecurity Review (2021) that became effective in February 2022 nor do we control more than one million users personal information. However, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in China are often uncertain, in flux, and complicated, including differentiated requirements for different groups of people or different types of data, and there can be no assurance that in the future our operations may not be subject to these regulations which could have a significant material impact on our financial performance and the value of our securities.\n\u25cf The Company relies on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our subsidiaries to fund our cash and financing requirements, and any limitation on the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Baijiakang Consulting and its VIEs ability to distribute dividends is based upon their distributable earnings. Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiary to pay dividends to its shareholders only out of its accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, our PRC subsidiary is required to set aside at least 10% of their after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of their registered capital. This reserve is not distributable as cash dividends. To the extent that cash derived from our VIEs businesses is in the PRC or Hong Kong, or in a PRC or Hong Kong entity, the funds may not be available to fund operations or for other use outside of the PRC or Hong Kong due to interventions in or the imposition of restrictions and limitations by the PRC government on the ability of our PRC or Hong Kong subsidiaries, or of our VIE, to transfer cash. The inability of our Hong Kong or PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends, for whatever reason, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and, in turn, on the value of our common stock.\n\u25cf To address persistent capital outflows and the RMBs depreciation against the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2016, the Peoples Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, implemented a series of capital control measures in the subsequent months, including stricter vetting procedures for China-based companies to remit foreign currency for overseas acquisitions, dividend payments, and shareholder loan repayments. The PRC government may continue to strengthen its capital controls and our PRC subsidiarys dividend payments and other distributions may be subject to tightened scrutiny in the future. The PRC government also imposes controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore, Baijiakang Consulting and our VIE may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of dividends from their profits, if any. Furthermore, if our PRC subsidiary incurs debt on its own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other payments.\n\u25cf\u202f The Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax at a rate of 10% will be applicable to dividends payable by Chinese companies to non-PRC-resident enterprises unless reduced under treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and the governments of other countries or regions where the non-PRC resident enterprises are tax resident. Pursuant to the tax agreement between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the withholding tax rate in respect to the payment of dividends by a PRC enterprise to a Hong Kong enterprise may be reduced to 5% from a standard rate of 10%. However, if the relevant tax authorities determine that our transactions or arrangements are for the primary purpose of enjoying a favorable tax treatment, the relevant tax authorities may adjust the favorable withholding tax in the future. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the reduced 5% withholding rate will apply to dividends received by our Hong Kong subsidiary from our PRC subsidiary. This withholding tax will reduce the amount of dividends we may receive from our PRC subsidiary.\n\u25cf A downturn in the Chinese or global economy or a change in economic and political policies of China could materially and adversely affect our VIEs businesses and financial condition. Any deterioration in our VIEs businesses could have a negative impact on the Companys financial position and, in turn, on the value of its common stock.\n\u25cf\nOur business operations are conducted in China through Baijiakang Consulting, our VIE, and its subsidiaries. If we should become subject to the recent scrutiny, criticism, and negative publicity involving U.S. listed China-based companies, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate and/or defend negative allegations. If such allegations cannot be addressed and resolved favorably, it could result in a material change in the business operations of our PRC subsidiary, significantly limit our ability to obtain financing through the sale of additional securities, and cause our securities to significantly decline in value or be worthless. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our shares involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are those significant risk factors, currently known and specific to us, that we believe are relevant to any investment in our securities. If any of these risks materialize, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could suffer, the price of our shares of common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to include risk factors in this Annual Report. However, below is a list of material risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could have a material effect on the Company and its operations, including its VIE structure and conducting business operations in the PRC.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nThe ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Companys ability to raise additional funds and implement its business plan.\nOur financial statements appearing in this Annual Report have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business are dependent on, among other things, the Companys ability to operate profitably, to generate cash flows from operations, and to pursue financing arrangements to support its working capital requirements.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability to raise additional financing. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of our business plan, and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. if we cannot continue as a going concern the holders of our common stock and our shareholders could lose all or a part of their investment. In such situations, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and results of operations.\nWe, through our Operating Subsidiary, are in the process of developing our business and have a limited operating history. You should consider our Operating Subsidiarys future prospects in light of the risks and uncertainties experienced by early-stage companies. Some of these risks and uncertainties relate to our Operating Subsidiarys ability to:\n\u25cf Offer products of sufficient quality to attract and retain a larger customer base;\n\u25cf Attract additional customers and increase spending per customer;\n\u25cf Increase awareness of our products and continue to develop customer loyalty;\n\u25cf Respond to competitive market conditions;\n\u25cf Respond to changes in our regulatory environment;\n\u25cf Maintain effective control of our costs and expenses;\n\u25cf Raise sufficient capital to sustain and expand our business; and\n\u25cf Attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nThe Company has incurred net losses during fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 and may incur losses again in the future.\nThe Company was dormant until December 2022. During fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, we incurred negative cash flow and losses from operations. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we experienced net losses in the amount of $776,643 and $664,782, respectively. There can be no assurance that the Company will not continue to experience negative cash flow and losses from operations, which could result in a loss of your entire investment in the shares of common stock.\nWe envision a period of rapid growth that may impose a significant burden on our administrative and operational resources that, if not effectively managed, could impair our growth.\nOur strategy for our Operating Subsidiaries envisions a period of rapid growth that may impose a significant burden on our administrative and operational resources. The growth of our business will require significant investments of capital and managements close attention. Our ability to effectively manage our growth will require us to substantially expand the capabilities of our administrative and operational resources and to attract, train, manage and retain qualified management, research and development, sales and marketing and other personnel; we may be unable to do so. In addition, our failure to successfully manage our growth could result in our sales not increasing commensurately with capital investments. If we are unable to successfully manage our growth, we may be unable to achieve our goals.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, and the scale and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, which could result in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenues and profitability.\nThe market for health products is highly competitive and we compete in various aspects, including brand recognition, value for money, user experience, breadth of product and service offerings, product quality, sales and distribution, supply chain management, customer loyalty, and talents, among others. Intensified competition may result in pricing pressures and reduced profitability and may impede our ability to achieve sustainable growth in our revenues or cause us to lose market share. Our competitors may also engage in aggressive and negative marketing or public relations strategies which may harm our reputation and increase our marketing expenses. Any of these results could substantially harm our results of operations.\nSome of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, including longer operating history, access to larger and broader user bases, greater brand recognition, greater financial, research and development, marketing, distribution, and other resources. We cannot assure you that we will compete with them successfully.\nA disruption, termination, or alteration of the supply of raw materials due to natural disasters, political and economic turmoil, or widespread disease or pandemics (such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic) could materially adversely affect the sales of our products.\nOur business depends on the supply of raw materials, and we are reliant on a consistent supply of raw materials in order to maintain our production capability. If our suppliers experience delays in delivering raw materials, or if the quality does not meet our standards, we could incur substantial costs or disruptions to our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nFurther, conditions such as public health crises could impair our ability to procure necessary materials. Such public health crises may also increase the cost of these materials. For example, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus in Wuhan, China (COVID-19) resulted in widespread quarantines and travel bans issued by the Chinese government in 2020 through 2022. Any future quarantines and travel bans, occasioned either by a resurgence of COVID-19 or any other epidemic, could have a substantial impact on our corporate operations in China and our operating results and revenues.\nIncreases in the price of raw materials or impact of currency value fluctuations could impact our ability to sustain and grow earnings.\nOur manufacturing processes consume substantial amounts of raw materials, the costs of which may be subject to supply and demand factors, as well as other factors beyond our control such as financial market trends. Raw material price fluctuations may adversely affect our results.\nOur business depends on the performance of sales companies, regional agents, and our branded supermarkets and disruptions within our distribution network could have a negative effect on our business.\nWe sell our products through a network of sales companies, regional agents, and our branded supermarkets and our business is therefore affected by our ability to establish new relationships and maintain relationships with our existing distribution channels. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain our goodwill with our sales companies and agents and renew our existing agreements on favorable terms, if at all. We also can provide no assurance that our branded supermarkets will be profitable or that we will succeed in increasing the size of our branded supermarket chain.\nWe have limited sources of working capital and will need substantial additional financing.\nThe working capital required to implement our business strategy and R&D efforts will most likely be provided by funds obtained through offerings of our equity, debt, debt-linked securities, and/or equity-linked securities, and revenues generated by us. No assurance can be given that we will have revenues sufficient to sustain our operations or that we would be able to obtain equity/debt financing in the current economic environment. If we do not have sufficient working capital and are unable to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional funds, we may delay the completion of or significantly reduce the scope of our current business plan; delay some of our development and marketing efforts; postpone the hiring of new personnel; or, under certain dire financial circumstances, substantially curtail or cease our operations.\nOur inability to obtain sufficient additional financing would have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan and, as a result, could require us to significantly curtail or potentially cease our operations. As of June 30, 2023, we had cash of $286,272, total current assets of $844,615 and total current liabilities of $3,909,576. We may need to engage in capital-raising transactions in the near future. Such financing transactions may well cause substantial dilution to our shareholders and could involve the issuance of securities with rights senior to the outstanding shares. Our ability to complete additional financings is dependent on, among other things, the state of the capital markets at the time of any proposed offering, market reception of the Company, and the likelihood of the success of its business model and offering terms. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such additional capital through asset sales, equity or debt financing, or any combination thereof, on satisfactory terms or at all. Additionally, no assurance can be given that any such financing, if obtained, will be adequate to meet our capital needs and to support our operations. If we do not obtain adequate capital on a timely basis and on satisfactory terms, our revenues and operations and the value of our common stock and common stock equivalents would be materially negatively impacted and we may cease our operations.\nWe are dependent on certain key personnel and loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur future business and results of operations depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our management, marketing, and technical personnel. They also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management, technical, marketing and sales and support personnel for our operations. As China is building its powerful technology industry and enhancing its market-oriented economic system, competition for talents becomes increasingly fierce. Many of our potential competitors have greater financial, personnel, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and other resources than we do. If we lose a key employee or if a key employee fails to perform in his or her current position, or if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees as needed, our business could suffer. We depend on the skills and abilities of these key employees in managing the technical, marketing and sales aspects of our business, any part of which could be harmed by further turnover.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property.\nWe rely on or intend to rely on our trademarks, trade names, and brand names to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors and have registered or will apply to register a number of these trademarks. However, third parties may oppose our trademark applications or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing these new brands. Further, our competitors may infringe our trademarks, or we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective quality control system, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe place great emphasis on product quality, adhere to stringent quality control measures, and have obtained quality control certifications for our products. To meet our customers requirements and expectations for the quality and safety of our products, we have adopted a stringent quality control system to ensure that every step of the production process is strictly monitored and managed. Failure to maintain an effective quality control system or to obtain or renew our quality standards certifications may result in a decrease in demand for our products or cancellation or loss of purchase orders from our customers. Moreover, our reputation could be impaired. As a result, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party logistics service providers to deliver our products. Disruption in logistics may prevent us from meeting customer demand and our business, results of operations, and financial condition may suffer as a result.\nWe engage third-party logistics service providers to deliver our products from our warehouses to our distributors and retail outlets. Disputes with or termination of our contractual relationships with one or more of our logistics service providers could result in delayed delivery of products or increased costs. There can be no assurance that we can continue or extend relationships with our current logistics service providers on terms acceptable to us, or that we will be able to establish relationships with new logistics service providers to ensure accurate, timely, and cost-efficient delivery services. If we are unable to maintain or develop good relationships with our preferred logistics service providers, it may inhibit our ability to offer products in sufficient quantities, on a timely basis, or at prices acceptable to our consumers. If there is any breakdown in our relationships with our preferred logistics service providers, we cannot assure you that interruptions in our product delivery will not occur or that they would not materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, and results of operations.\nAs we do not have any direct control over these logistics service providers, we cannot guarantee their quality of service. In addition, services provided by these logistics service providers could be interrupted by unforeseen events beyond our control, such as poor handling provided by these logistics service providers, natural disasters, pandemics, adverse weather conditions, riots, and labor strikes. If there is any delay in delivery, damage to products, or any other issue, we may lose customers and sales and our brand image may be tarnished.\nOur VIEs production facilities may be unable to maintain efficiency, encounter problems in ramping up production, or otherwise have difficulty meeting our production requirements.\nOur nutritional products are manufactured under contract with a company entrusted by Liaoning Kangbaier, which holds a Food Production License. Our future growth will depend upon our ability to maintain efficient operations at their existing production facilities and our ability to expand their production capacity as we require. The utilization rate of the production facilities depends primarily on the demand for our products and the availability and maintenance of the equipment but may also be affected by other factors, such as the availability of employees, seasonal factors, and changes in environmental laws and regulations. In order to meet our customers demands and advancements in technology, we maintain and upgrade our equipment periodically. If we are unable to maintain our production facilities efficiency, we may be unable to fulfill our purchase orders in a timely manner, or at all. This would negatively impact our reputation, business, and results of operations.\nWe will be required to hire and retain skilled managerial, research and development, and sales and marketing personnel.\nOur continued success depends in large part on our ability to attract, train, motivate, and retain qualified management, research and development, and sales and marketing personnel. Any failure to attract and retain the required personnel who are integral to our business may have a negative impact on our operations, which would have a negative impact on revenues. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain skilled persons, and the loss of skilled personnel would adversely affect us.\nWe are dependent upon our sole officer for direction, and the loss of our sole officer could adversely affect our operations and results.\nWe are dependent on our sole officer, Xiuzhi Sun, for implementation of our proposed strategy and execution of our business plan. The loss of Ms. Sun could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. We do not maintain key person life insurance on Ms. Sun. The loss of Ms. Sun could delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nOur Operating Subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all necessary licenses, permits, and approvals and to make all necessary registrations and filings for their business activities in multiple jurisdictions and related to residents therein, especially in the PRC, or otherwise relating to PRC residents.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, our Operating Subsidiary and our VIE have received all necessary governmental approvals and licenses for operations in the PRC, including the business approvals and licenses issued by the PRC State Administration for Market Regulation, and neither of them has been denied any such approvals. However, in the event that our Operating Subsidiary or our VIE has erroneously concluded that certain licenses, permits, or approvals are not required or if applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change and they are required to obtain additional permissions or approvals in the future, our Operating Subsidiary and/or our VIE may incur significant costs and expenses and may need to budget additional resources to comply with any such requirements. Moreover, if either our Operating Subsidiary or our VIE fails to renew its relevant licenses or filings or fails to obtain future required licenses, permits, or approvals, it may become subject to fines and other penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial condition.\nThe global coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic and many businesses and social activities in China and other countries and regions were severely disrupted. This pandemic also caused market panics, which materially and negatively affected the global financial markets, such as the plunge of global stocks on major stock exchanges in March 2020. The COVID-19 virus continues to evolve and spread. If there is a significant resurgence of COVID-19 in China, we and our customers could experience significant business disruptions and suspension of operations due to quarantine measures to contain the spread of the virus, which could cause shortages in the supply of raw materials, reduce our production capacity, increase the likelihood of default from our customers, and delay our product delivery. All of these could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business, operations, and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that the Company cannot accurately predict at this time, including the uncertainty regarding the potential resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China, and the response of the local government to any such resurgence. We are closely monitoring the status of the COVID-19 pandemic and continuously evaluating any further potential impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If China experiences a resurgence of COVID-19 in the future, we may be subject to a negative impact on our business operations and financial condition.\nWe may be sued or become a party to litigation, which could require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses and may result in an unfavorable outcome, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to lawsuits from time to time arising in the ordinary course of our business. The expense of defending ourselves against such litigation may be significant. The amount of time to resolve these lawsuits is unpredictable, and defending ourselves may divert managements attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nFuture sales of our securities, or the perception in the markets that these sales may occur, could depress our stock price.\nWe currently have issued and outstanding 7,250,750 shares of common stock. Shares may be sold in the future if registered under the Securities Act or if the shareholder qualifies for an exemption from registration under Rule 144 or Rule 701 under the Securities Act, or another applicable exemption. The market price of our capital stock could drop significantly if the holders of our restricted shares of common stock sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors also could make it more difficult for us to raise capital or make acquisitions through the issuance of additional shares or other equity securities.\nThe war in Ukraine could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe outbreak of war in Ukraine has affected global economic markets, including a dramatic increase in the price of oil and gas, and the uncertain resolution of this conflict could result in protracted and/or severe damage to the global economy. Russias military interventions in Ukraine have led to, and may lead to, additional sanctions being levied by the United States, the European Union, and other countries against Russia. Russias military incursion and the resulting sanctions could adversely affect global energy and financial markets and thus could affect our customers businesses and our business, even though we do not have any direct exposure to Russia or the adjoining geographic regions. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions, and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be substantial. Any such disruptions caused by Russian military action or resulting sanctions may magnify the impact of other risks described herein. We cannot predict the progress or outcome of the situation in Ukraine, as the conflict and governmental reactions are rapidly developing and beyond our control. Prolonged unrest, intensified military activities, or more extensive sanctions impacting the region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy, and such effect could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe are exposed to risks in respect of acts of war, terrorist attacks, epidemics, political unrest, adverse weather conditions, and other uncontrollable events.\nUnforeseeable circumstances and other factors such as power outages, labor disputes, adverse weather conditions or other catastrophes, epidemics, or outbreaks of communicable diseases such as COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Ebola, or other contagious diseases may disrupt our operations and cause loss and damage to our production facilities, and acts of war, terrorist attacks, or other acts of violence may further materially and adversely affect the global financial markets and consumer confidence. Any of such incidents may have a widespread effect on our business operations, which could in turn adversely and materially affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur revenue is susceptible to changes in the economic conditions and regulatory environment, social and/or political conditions, and civil disturbance or disobedience. We cannot assure you that there will be no political or social unrest in the near future or that there will not be other events that could lead to widespread protests or the disruption of the economic, political, and social conditions in the PRC. If such events persist for a prolonged period of time or the economic, political, and social conditions in the PRC are disrupted, our overall business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf and when we expand our marketing efforts outside of China, our business may also be affected by macroeconomic factors in the other countries where our customers are located, such as general economic conditions, market sentiment, and regulatory, fiscal, and other governmental policies, all of which are beyond our control. Any such events may cause damage or disruption to our business, markets, customers, and suppliers, any of which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nRisks Relating to our Commercial Relationship with our VIE\nPRC laws and regulations governing our business and the validity of certain of our contractual arrangements are uncertain. If we are found to be in violation of such PRC laws and regulations, our business may be negatively affected, and we may be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations.\nPRC laws and regulations prohibit or restrict foreign ownership of companies that operate Internet information and content, value added telecommunications, and certain other businesses in which we are engaged or could be deemed to be engaged. Consequently, we conduct certain of our operations and businesses in the PRC through our VIE. Our VIE Agreements give us effective control over our VIE, Liaoning Kangbaier, and enable us to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits arising from it as well as consolidate its financial results in our results of operations. Although the structure we have adopted is commonly adopted by comparable companies in China, the PRC government may not agree that these arrangements comply with PRC licensing, registration, or other regulatory requirements, with existing policies, or with requirements or policies that may be adopted in the future.\nThe Company, Cambell International, Win&Win and BJK Holding are considered foreign investors and Baijiakang Consultingis considered a foreign invested enterprise under PRC law. As a result, Cambell International, Win&Win and BJK Holding are subject to certain limitations under PRC law on foreign ownership of Chinese companies. These laws and regulations are relatively new and may be subject to change, and their official interpretation and enforcement may involve substantial uncertainty. The effectiveness of newly enacted laws, regulations, or amendments may be delayed, resulting in detrimental reliance by foreign investors. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively.\nWe believe that the ownership structures of our PRC subsidiary and our VIE in China do not violate any applicable PRC law, regulation, or rule currently in effect; and that the contractual arrangements between Baijiakang Consulting, its VIE, Liaoning Kangbaier, and its equity holders governed by PRC law are valid, binding, and enforceable in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws and regulations currently in effect. However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current PRC laws, rules, and regulations. Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities and PRC courts may in the future take a view that is contrary to the opinion of our PRC legal counsel.\nThe PRC government has broad discretion in dealing with violations of laws and regulations, including levying fines, revoking business and other licenses, and requiring actions necessary for compliance. In particular, licenses and permits issued or granted to us by relevant governmental bodies may be revoked at a later time by higher regulatory bodies. We cannot predict the effect of the interpretation of existing or new PRC laws or regulations on our business. We cannot assure you that our current ownership and operating structure would not be found in violation of any current or future PRC laws or regulations. As a result, we may be subject to sanctions, including fines, and could be required to restructure our operations or cease to provide certain services. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. If the imposition of any of these government actions causes us to lose our right to direct the activities of our VIE or to otherwise separate from them and if we are not able to restructure our ownership structure and operations in a satisfactory manner, we would no longer be able to consolidate the financial results of our VIE in our consolidated financial statements. Any of these or similar actions could significantly disrupt our business operations or restrict us from conducting a substantial portion of our business operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe conduct our operations in China through our PRC subsidiary and our VIE with which we maintain contractual arrangements. There are risks associated with this structure as the PRC has not yet ruled on its legality.\nWe are not a Chinese operating company but rather a Nevada holding company with a majority of our operations in the PRC conducted by our PRC subsidiary, Baijiakang Consulting, through contractual agreements which we maintain with , Liaoning Kangbaier, which is our VIE. Investors have not purchased an equity interest in the VIE but have purchased equity interests in a holding company incorporated in the State of Nevada, and will never directly hold equity interests in our PRC subsidiary or our VIE in China.\nA series of contractual agreements, including the Consulting Service Agreement, the Business Operation Agreement, the Proxy Agreement, the Equity Disposal Agreement, and the Equity Pledge Agreement, have been entered into with our VIE, Liaoning Kangbaier, and its shareholders. The ownership structure of our VIE in China does not violate any applicable and explicit PRC laws and regulations currently in effect, and each of the contractual agreements governed by the PRC law is valid, binding, and enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to enforceability of applicable laws and the discretion of relevant government authorities in exercising their authority in connection with the interpretation and implementation thereof. As a result of the contractual agreements, we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE for accounting purposes, and we have consolidated the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of the VIE in our consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP. The contractual arrangements with the VIE provide us with a controlling financial interest in the VIE by granting us: (i) the power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly affect its economic performance; and (ii) the right to receive economic benefits from the VIE.\nHowever, there are risks associated with this structure as the PRC has not yet ruled on its legality. As such, the VIE structure involves unique risks to our investors in the Nevada holding company. The risks are:\n(i) Our contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing us with operational control, and shareholders of the VIE may fail to perform their obligations under the contractual arrangements.\n(ii) We may incur substantial costs to enforce the terms of the arrangements with the VIE.\n(iii) The legality and enforceability of the contractual arrangements by and between our PRC subsidiary and the VIE have not been tested in a court of law in China.\n(iv) The equity holders, directors and executive officers of the VIE as well as our employees who execute other strategic initiatives may have potential conflicts of interest with our Company\n(v) There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, regulations and rules regarding the status of our Nevada holding company with respect to the contractual arrangements with the VIE.\n(vi) It is uncertain whether any new PRC laws or regulations relating to VIE structures will be adopted or, if adopted, what they would provide.\n(vii) If we or our VIE is found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, or fail to obtain or maintain any of the required licenses, permits, registrations, or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion to take action in dealing with such violations or failures.\n(viii) If the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the VIE structure for operating our business do not comply with PRC laws and regulations, or if these regulations or their interpretations change in the future, we would be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interest in those operations.\n(ix) If the PRC government deems that our contractual arrangements with the VIE do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions on foreign investment in the relevant industries, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change or any interpreted differently in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in these operations.\n(x) Our Nevada holding company, our PRC subsidiary, the VIE, and our investors face uncertainty with respect to potential future actions by the PRC government that could affect the enforceability of the contractual arrangements with the VIE and consequently significantly affect the financial performance of the VIE and our Company as a whole.\n(xi) The PRC regulatory authorities could disallow the VIE structure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations and cause the value of our securities, including those we have or may in the future register for sale, to significantly decline or become worthless.\nOur arrangements with our VIE and its shareholders may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities. Any adjustment of related party transaction pricing could lead to additional taxes, and therefore could have an adverse effect on our income and expenses.\nThe tax regime in China is rapidly evolving and there is significant uncertainty for taxpayers in China as PRC tax laws may be interpreted in significantly different ways. The PRC tax authorities may assert that we or our subsidiaries or VIE, or its equity holders, owe and/or are required to pay additional taxes on previous or future revenue or income. In particular, under applicable PRC laws, rules, and regulations, arrangements and transactions among related parties, such as the contractual arrangements with our VIE, may be subject to audit or challenge by the PRC tax authorities. We could face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that our agreements with our VIE and its shareholders were not entered into based on arms length negotiations. As a result, they may adjust our income and expenses for PRC tax purposes in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. Such an adjustment may require that we pay additional PRC taxes plus applicable penalties and interest, if any.\nOur current corporate structure and business operations may be substantially affected by the newly enacted Foreign Investment Law.\nOn March 15, 2019, the National Peoples Congress promulgated the Foreign Investment Law, which took effect on January 1, 2020. Since it is relatively new, substantial uncertainties exist in relation to its interpretation and implementation. The Foreign Investment Law does not explicitly classify variable interest entities that are controlled through contractual arrangements as foreign invested enterprises even if they are ultimately controlled by foreign investors. However, it has a catch-all provision under the definition of foreign investment that includes investments made by foreign investors in China through other means as provided by laws, administrative regulations, or the State Council. Therefore, it still leaves leeway for future laws, administrative regulations, or provisions of the State Council to provide for contractual arrangements as a form of foreign investment, at which time it will be uncertain whether our contractual arrangements will be deemed to be in violation of the market access requirements for foreign investment in the PRC, and if they are deemed to be in violation, how our contractual arrangements should be dealt with.\nThe Foreign Investment Law grants national treatment to foreign-invested entities, except for those foreign-invested entities that operate in industries specified as either restricted or prohibited from foreign investment in the Special Administrative Measures (Negative List) for Foreign Investment Access jointly promulgated by MOFCOM and the NDRC that took effect in July 2020. The Foreign Investment Law provides that foreign-invested entities operating in restricted or prohibited industries will require market entry clearance and other approvals from relevant PRC government authorities. If our control over our VIE through contractual arrangements is deemed to be foreign investment in the future, and if any business of our VIE is restricted or prohibited from foreign investment under the negative list effective at the time, we may be deemed to be in violation of the Foreign Investment Law, the contractual arrangements that allow us to have control over our VIE may be deemed to be invalid and illegal, and we may be required to unwind such contractual arrangements and/or restructure our business operations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nFurthermore, if future laws, administrative regulations, or provisions mandate further actions to be taken by companies with respect to existing contractual arrangements, we may face substantial uncertainties as to whether we can complete such actions in a timely manner, or at all. Failure to take timely and appropriate measures to cope with any of these or similar regulatory compliance challenges could materially and adversely affect our current corporate structure and business operations.\nOur contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing control over our variable interest entity as direct ownership.\nWe rely on contractual arrangements with our VIE to operate our electronic platform in China and other businesses in which foreign investment is restricted or prohibited. These contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us with control over our VIE.\nIf we had direct ownership of the VIE, we would be able to exercise our rights as an equity holder directly to effect changes in the Board of Directors of the entity, which could effect changes at the management and operational level. Under our contractual arrangements, we would be able to change the members of the Board of Directors of the entity exclusively by influencing the equity holders votes, and we would have to rely on the variable interest entity and the variable interest entity equity holders to perform their obligations under the contractual arrangements in order to exercise our control over the variable interest entity. The variable interest entity equity holders may have conflicts of interest with us or our shareholders, and they may not act in the best interests of our Company or may not perform their obligations under these contracts. For example, our VIE and its equity holders could breach their contractual arrangements with us by, among other things, failing to conduct their operations, including maintaining our website and using our domain names and trademarks, which the variable interest entity has the exclusive right to use, in an acceptable manner, or taking other actions that are detrimental to our interests. Pursuant to the call option, we may replace the equity holders of the VIE at any time pursuant to the contractual arrangements. However, if any equity holder is uncooperative and any dispute relating to these contracts or to the replacement of the equity holder were to remain unresolved, we would have to enforce our rights under the contractual arrangements through the operation of PRC law and arbitral or judicial agencies, which may be costly and time-consuming and would be subject to uncertainties in the PRC legal system. Consequently, the contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in ensuring our control over the relevant portion of our business operations.\nAny failure by our VIE or its equity holders to perform their obligations under the contractual arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our VIE or its equity holders fail to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend additional resources to enforce such arrangements. Although we have entered into an option agreement in relation to our variable interest entity, which provides that we may exercise an option to acquire, or nominate a person to acquire, ownership of the equity in that entity or, in some cases, its assets, to the extent permitted by applicable PRC laws, rules, and regulations, the exercise of the option is subject to the review and approval of the relevant PRC governmental authorities. We have also entered into an equity interest pledge agreement with respect to the variable interest entity to secure certain obligations of such VIE or its equity holders to us under the contractual arrangements. However, the enforcement of such agreement through arbitral or judicial agencies may be costly and time-consuming and would be subject to uncertainties in the PRC legal system. Moreover, our remedies under the equity pledge agreement are primarily intended to help us collect debts owed to us by the variable interest entity equity holders under the contractual arrangements and may not help us in acquiring the assets or equity of the variable interest entity.\nThe contractual arrangements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration or court proceedings in China. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC law and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. The legal system in the PRC is not as developed as in some other jurisdictions, such as the United States. Moreover, there are very few precedents and little formal guidance as to how contractual arrangements in the context of a variable interest entity should be interpreted or enforced under PRC law, and as a result it may be difficult to predict how an arbitration panel or court would view such contractual arrangements. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce the contractual arrangements. Under PRC law, if the losing parties fail to carry out the arbitration awards or court judgments within a prescribed time limit, the prevailing parties may only enforce the arbitration awards or court judgments in PRC courts, which would require additional expense and delay. In the event we are unable to enforce the contractual arrangements, we may not be able to exert effective control over our variable interest entity and our ability to conduct our business, as well as our financial condition and results of operations, may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nChanges in international trade or investment policies and barriers to trade or investment and the ongoing geopolitical conflict may have an adverse effect on our business and expansion plans and could lead to the delisting of our securities from U.S. exchanges and/or other restrictions or prohibitions on investing in our securities.\nIn recent years, international market conditions and the international regulatory environment have been increasingly affected by competition among countries and geopolitical frictions. In particular, the U.S. administration has advocated for and taken steps toward restricting trade in certain goods, particularly from China. From 2018 to late 2019, the United States announced several tariff increases that applied to products imported from China, totaling over US$550 billion. By the end of 2019, the two countries had reached a phase one trade deal to roll back tariffs and suspend certain tariff increases by the United States that were scheduled to take effect from December 2019, and in January 2020, the two sides entered into a formal phase one agreement on trade. The progress of trade talks between China and the United States is subject to uncertainties, and there can be no assurance as to whether the United States will maintain or reduce tariffs or impose additional tariffs on Chinese products in the near future. Furthermore, in August 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department labeled China as a currency manipulator, which label was officially dropped by the U.S. Treasury Department in January 2020. However, it is uncertain whether the U.S. government may issue any similar announcements in the future. As a result of such announcement, the United States may take further actions to eliminate perceived unfair competitive advantages created by alleged manipulating actions. Changes to national trade or investment policies, treaties and tariffs, fluctuations in exchange rates, or the perception that these changes could occur could adversely affect the financial and economic conditions in China, as well as our future international and cross-border operations, our financial condition, and our results of operations.\nIn addition, the United States is considering ways to limit U.S. investment portfolio flows into China. For example, in May 2020, under pressure from U.S. administration officials, the independent Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board suspended its implementation of plans to change the benchmark of one of its retirement asset funds to an international index that includes companies in emerging markets, including China. China-based companies, including us, may become subject to executive orders or other regulatory actions that may, among other things, prohibit U.S. investors from investing in these companies and delist the securities of these companies from U.S. exchanges. As a result, U.S. and certain other persons may be prohibited from investing in the securities of our Company, whether or not they are listed on U.S. exchanges. For example, in November 2020, the U.S. administration issued U.S. Executive Order 13959, prohibiting investments by any U.S. person in publicly traded securities of certain Chinese companies that are deemed owned or controlled by the Chinese military. In May 2021, the American depositary shares of China Telecom, China Mobile, and China Unicom were delisted from the NYSE to comply with this executive order. In June 2021, the U.S. administration expanded the scope of the executive order to Chinese defense and surveillance technology companies. Geopolitical tensions between China and the United States may intensify and the United States may adopt even more drastic measures in the future.\nChina and other countries have retaliated and may further retaliate in response to new trade policies, treaties and tariffs implemented by the United States. For instance, in response to the tariffs announced by the United States, in 2018 and 2019, China announced it would stop buying U.S. agricultural products and imposed tariffs on over US$185 billion worth of U.S. goods. Although China subsequently granted tariff exemptions for certain U.S. products as a result of trade talks and the phase one trade deal with the United States, it is uncertain whether there will be any further material changes to Chinas tariff policies. Any further actions to increase existing tariffs or impose additional tariffs could result in an escalation of the trade conflict, which would have an adverse effect on manufacturing, trade, and a wide range of industries that rely on trade, including logistics, retail sales, and other businesses and services, which could adversely affect our business operations and financial results.\nAdditionally, China has issued regulations to give itself the ability to unilaterally nullify the effects of certain foreign restrictions that are deemed to be unjustified to Chinese individuals and entities. The Rules on Counteracting Unjustified Extra-territorial Application of Foreign Legislation and Other Measures promulgated by the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) on January 9, 2021 with immediate effect, provide that, among other things, Chinese individuals or entities are required to report to the MOFCOM within 30 days if they are prohibited or restricted from engaging in normal business activities with third-party countries or their nationals or entities due to non-Chinese laws or measures; and the MOFCOM, following the decision of the relevant Chinese authorities, may issue prohibition orders contravening such non-Chinese laws or measures. Furthermore, on June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress of China promulgated the Anti-foreign Sanctions Law, which came into effect on the same day. The Anti-foreign Sanctions Law prohibits any organization or individual from implementing or providing assistance in implementation of discriminatory restrictive measures taken by any foreign state against the citizens or organizations of China. In addition, all organizations and individuals in China are required to implement the retaliatory measures taken by relevant departments of the State Council. Since the aforesaid laws and rules were newly promulgated, there exist high uncertainties as to how such regulations will be interpreted and implemented and how they would affect our business and results of operations or the trading prices of our Shares.\nThe institution of trade tariffs both globally and between the U.S. and China specifically carries the risk of negatively affecting Chinas overall economic condition, which could have a negative impact on us.\nTrade tensions and policy changes have also led to measures that could have adverse effects on China-based issuers, including proposed legislation in the United States that would require listed companies whose audit reports and/or auditors who are subject to review by PCAOB to be subject to enhanced disclosure obligations and be subject to delisting if they do not comply with the requirements.\nIf the Chinese government were to impose new requirements for approval from the PRC authorities to issue the Companys shares of common stock to foreign investors or list on a foreign exchange, such action could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause such securities to significantly decline in value or become worthless.\nRecently, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the Opinions on Severely Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities According to Law, or the Opinions, which were made available to the public on July 6, 2021. The Opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities and the need to strengthen the supervision over overseas listings by Chinese companies.\nBased on our understanding of currently applicable PRC laws and regulations, the Company and its PRC subsidiary: (i) are not currently required to obtain permissions from any PRC authorities to operate or to issue securities to foreign investors; (ii) are not subject to permission requirements from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the CSRC), the Cyberspace Administration of China (the CAC) or any other entity that is required to approve their operations; and (iii) have not been denied any permissions by any PRC authorities. In addition, BJK Holding, our Hong Kong subsidiary that owns 100% of the outstanding shares of Baijiakang (Liaoning), is afforded the legal protections of national treatment under the Foreign Investment Law of the Peoples Republic of China.\nIf we have erroneously concluded that these permission requirements do not apply to us, or if applicable laws, regulations or interpretations change, and it is determined in the future that the permission requirements become applicable to us, we may be subject to review, may face challenges in addressing these requirements and may incur substantial costs in complying with these requirements, which could result in material adverse changes in our business operations and financial position. In addition, if we are not able to fully comply with the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021 version) or if the Opinions are determined to be applicable to us, our ability to offer or to continue to offer securities to investors may be significantly limited or completely hindered, and our securities may significantly decline in value or become worthless.\nThe New Overseas Listing Rules and other relevant rules promulgated by the CSRC may subject us to additional compliance requirements in the future.\nOn February 17, 2023, the CSRC promulgated the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the Trial Measures) and five supporting guidelines, which came into effect on March 31, 2023. On February 17, 2023, the CSRC also issued the Notice on the Administrative Arrangements for the Filing of the Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the CSRC Notice). Pursuant to the Trial Measures and the CSRC Notice, among other things, (i) a domestic company that seeks to offer or list securities overseas, both directly and indirectly, must complete certain filing procedures with the CSRC within three working days following its submission of an initial public offering or listing application; and (ii) domestic companies which have already, directly or indirectly, offered and listed securities in overseas markets prior to the effectiveness of the Trial Measures are required to fulfill their filing obligations and report relevant information to the CSRC within three working days after conducting a follow-on offering of equity securities on the same overseas market. If the issuer meets both of the following criteria, the overseas offering and listing conducted by such issuer shall be deemed an indirect overseas offering and listing by a PRC domestic company: (i) 50% or more of any of the issuers operating revenue, total profit, total assets or net assets as documented in its audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent fiscal year were derived from PRC domestic companies; and (ii) the majority of the issuers business activities are carried out in mainland China, or its main place(s) of business are located in mainland China, or the majority of its senior management team in charge of its business operations and management are PRC citizens or have their usual place(s) of residence located in mainland China. Where a PRC domestic company is seeking an indirect overseas offering and listing in an overseas market, the issuer shall designate a major domestic operating entity responsible for all filing procedures with the CSRC. If a domestic company fails to complete the required filing procedures or conceals any material fact or falsifies any major content in its filing documents, such domestic company may be subject to administrative penalties, such as an order to rectify, warnings and fines, and its controlling shareholders, actual controllers, the person directly in charge and other directly liable persons may also be subject to administrative penalties, such as warnings and fines.\nOn February 24, 2023, the CSRC and other PRC governmental authorities jointly revised the Provisions on Strengthening Confidentiality and Archives Administration for Overseas Securities Offering and Listing, which were issued in 2009 (the Provisions). The revised Provisions were issued under the title the Provisions on Strengthening Confidentiality and Archives Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, and came into effect on March 31, 2023, together with the Trial Measures. One of the major revisions in the revised Provisions is the expansion of their application to cover indirect overseas offerings and listings, as is consistent with the Trial Measures. The revised Provisions require that, among other things, (i) a domestic company that plans to, either directly or indirectly through its overseas listed entity, publicly disclose or provide to relevant individuals or entities, including securities companies, securities service providers and overseas regulators, any documents and materials that contain state secrets or working secrets of government agencies shall first obtain approval from competent authorities according to law and file with the secrecy administrative department at the same level; and (ii) a domestic company that plans to, either directly or indirectly through its overseas listed entity, publicly disclose or provide to relevant individuals and entities, including securities companies, securities service providers and overseas regulators, any other documents and materials that, if leaked, will be detrimental to national security or public interest, shall strictly fulfill relevant procedures stipulated by applicable national regulations. On or after March 31, 2023, any failure or perceived failure by the Company and its subsidiaries to comply with the above confidentiality and archives administration requirements under the revised Provisions and other PRC laws and regulations may result in the relevant entities being held legally liable by competent authorities and referred to the judicial branch to be investigated for criminal liability if suspected of committing a crime.\nThe Trial Measures and the revised Provisions recently issued by PRC authorities may subject us to additional compliance requirements in the future if we should undertake a public offering or a refinancing, as there are still uncertainties regarding the interpretation and implementation of such regulatory guidance, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all the new regulatory requirements of the Trial Measures, the revised Provisions or any future implementing rules on a timely basis, or at all. Any failure by us to fully comply with the new regulatory requirements, including but not limited to the failure to complete the filing procedures with the CSRC, may significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our shares of common stock, cause significant disruption to our business operations, and severely damage our reputation, which would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and cause our shares of common stock to significantly decline in value or become worthless.\nFurthermore, the PRC government authorities may further strengthen oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers like us. Any such action may adversely affect our operations and significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to you and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or the securities to be worthless.\nThe enactment of the Law of the PRC on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (the Hong Kong National Security Law) could impact our Hong Kong subsidiary, and the market price for our shares could be adversely affected by increased tensions between the United States and China.\nRecently there have been heightened tensions in the economic and political relations between the United States and China. On June 30, 2020, the Standing Committee of the PRC National Peoples Congress issued the Law of the Peoples Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). This law defines the duties and government bodies of the HKSAR for safeguarding national security and four categories of offences-secession, subversion, terrorist activities and collusion with a foreign country or external elements to endanger national security-and their corresponding penalties. On July 14, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump signed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, or HKAA, into law, authorizing the U.S. administration to impose blocking sanctions against individuals and entities who are determined to have materially contributed to the erosion of Hong Kongs autonomy. On August 7, 2020, the U.S. government imposed HKAA-authorized sanctions on eleven individuals, including former HKSAR chief executive Carrie Lam and current HKSAR chief executive John Lee. On October 14, 2020, the U.S. State Department submitted to relevant committees of Congress the report required under the HKAA, identifying persons materially contributing to the failure of the Government of China to meet its obligations under the Joint Declaration or the Basic Law. The HKAA further authorizes secondary sanctions, including the imposition of blocking sanctions, against foreign financial institutions that knowingly conduct a significant transaction with foreign persons sanctioned under this authority. The imposition of sanctions such as those provided in the HKAA is in practice discretionary and highly political, especially in a relationship as extensive and complex as that between the United States and China. It is difficult to predict the full impact of the Hong Kong National Security Law and HKAA on Hong Kong and companies located in Hong Kong like our Hong Kong subsidiary. If we or our Hong Kong or PRC subsidiaries are determined to be in violation of the Hong Kong National Security Law or the HKAA by competent authorities, our business operations, financial position, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, legislative or administrative actions in respect of Sino-U.S. relations could cause investor uncertainty for affected issuers, including us, and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe Chinese government may choose to exercise significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business operations in China.\nThe Chinese government may choose to exercise significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business operations in China. Such governmental actions:\n\u25cf could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our shares;\n\u25cf could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to continue our operations in China;\n\u25cf could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our shares to investors; and\n\u25cf may cause the value of our shares to significantly decline or the shares to be worthless.\nRecently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and new policies to regulate business operations in certain areas in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using a VIE structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. Since these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon the legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any. It is also highly uncertain what the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operation, our ability to accept foreign investments and the continued listing of our shares in the U.S. markets. These actions could result in a material change in our operations and/could cause the value of our shares to significantly decline or become worthless.\nOn February 17, 2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the CSRC) released the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, or the Trial Measures, which came into effect on March 31, 2023. On the same date as the issuance of the Trial Measures, the CSRC circulated No. 1 to No. 5 Supporting Guidance Rules, the Notes on the Trial Measures, the Notice on Administration Arrangements for the Filing of Overseas Listings by Domestic Enterprises, and the relevant CSRC Answers to Reporter Questions on the official website of the CSRC, or collectively, the Guidance Rules and Notice. The Trial Measures, together with the Guidance Rules and Notice, reiterate the basic supervision principles as reflected in the Overseas Listing Regulations by providing substantially the same requirements for filings of overseas offerings and listings by domestic companies, yet made the following updates compared to the Overseas Listing Regulations: (a) further clarification of the circumstances prohibiting overseas issuance and listing; (b) further clarification of the standard of indirect overseas listing under the principle of substance over form, and (c) adding more details of filing procedures and requirements by setting different filing requirements for different types of overseas offerings and listing.\nPursuant to the Trial Measures and the Guidance Rules and Notice, domestic companies that seek to offer or list securities overseas, both directly and indirectly, should fulfill the filing procedure and report relevant information to the CSRC within three working days following its submission of initial public offerings or listing application. Companies that have already been listed on overseas stock exchanges or have obtained the approval from overseas supervision administrations or stock exchanges for their offerings and listings and that will complete their overseas offerings and listings prior to September 30, 2023 are not required to make immediate filings for their listings yet need to make filings for subsequent offerings in accordance with the Trial Measures. Companies that have already submitted an application for an initial public offering to overseas supervision administrations prior to the effective date of the Trial Measures but have not yet obtained approval from overseas supervision administrations or stock exchanges for the offering and listing may arrange for the filing within a reasonable time period and should complete the filing procedure before such companies overseas issuance and listing.\nThe Chinese government has also exercised, and continues to exercise, substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership, including those relating to regulation of the health product industry, taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property ownership and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Accordingly, government actions in the future could have a significant effect on us and our business.\nChanges in the policies, regulations and rules, and the enforcement of laws of the PRC government may be implemented quickly with little advance notice and could have a significant impact upon our Operating Subsidiarys ability to operate profitably in the PRC. The PRC legal system also embodies uncertainties, which could limit law enforcement availability. Therefore, our assertions and beliefs of the risk imposed by the PRC legal and regulatory system cannot be certain.\nThe PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, decided legal cases have little precedence. In 1979, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general. The overall effect of legislation over the past several decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investment in China. Our Operating Subsidiaries are subject to PRC laws and regulations. However, these laws and regulations change frequently, and the interpretation and enforcement thereof involve uncertainties. For instance, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce the legal protections to which we are entitled to by law or contract. However, since PRC administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting statutory and contractual terms, it may be difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative court proceedings and the level of law enforcement that we would receive in more developed legal systems. Such uncertainties, including the inability of our Operating Subsidiaries to enforce their contracts, could affect our business and operation. In addition, confidentiality protections in China may not be as effective as in the United States or other countries. Accordingly, we cannot predict the effect of future developments in the PRC legal system, particularly with regard to our business, including the promulgation of new laws. This may include changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, or the preemption of local regulations by national laws. These uncertainties could limit the availability of law enforcement.\nThe legal system in China, it laws and regulation changing frequently and the uncertainty in interpretation and enforcement of those laws could result in a material change in our operations, and further significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.\nChinas economic policies could affect our Operating Subsidiarys business.\nA substantial amount of our assets are located in China, and revenue is currently derived from our Operating Subsidiarys operations in China. Accordingly, our results of operations and prospects are subject, to a significant extent, to economic, political and legal developments in China.\nWhile Chinas economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has been irregular, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy, and the rate of growth has been slowing since 2012. Any adverse changes in economic conditions in China, in the policies of the Chinese government, or in the laws and regulations in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China. Such developments could adversely affect our business and operating results, lead to a reduction in demand for our products, and adversely affect our competitive position. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures benefit the overall economy of China but may also have a negative effect on us. For example, our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations.\nThe economy of China has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. In recent years, the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises; however, a substantial portion of productive assets in China are still owned by the Chinese government. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. It also exercises significant control over Chinas economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\nMany of the economies in Asia, including China, are experiencing substantial inflationary pressures, which may prompt governments to take action to control the growth of the economy and inflation that could lead to a significant decrease in our profitability.\nWhile many of the economies in Asia, including China, have experienced rapid growth over the last two decades, they currently are experiencing inflationary pressures. Inflationary pressures may result in government intervention in the economy, including policies that may adversely affect the overall performance of the respective countries economy, which could, in turn, adversely affect our operations and the price of our common stock. As governments take steps to address the current inflationary pressures, there may be significant changes in the availability of bank credit, interest rates, limitations on loans and restrictions on currency conversion and foreign investment. There also may be imposition of price controls. If prices for products from our suppliers and/or own products rise at a rate that is insufficient to compensate for the rise in the costs of supplies, it may have an adverse effect on our profitability because of a decrease in revenue. In addition, if these or other similar restrictions are imposed by a government to influence the economy, it may lead to a slowing of economic growth.\nInflation, measures to contain inflation, and speculation about potential measures can also contribute to significant uncertainty in relation to the economy and weaken investor confidence, which could affect our ability to access finance, including access to equity of international capital markets. Future measures by the governments, including increases in interest rates, intervention in the foreign exchange market, and actions to adjust or fix the value of monetary denominations may trigger further increases in inflation, adversely affecting the overall performance of the respective economies. Inflation can also increase our costs and expenses, and we may not be able to transfer such costs to our customers, which would reduce our profits and net profit margins.\nChanges in Chinas economic, political, or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.\nSubstantially all of our operations are conducted in the PRC. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations are affected to a significant extent by economic, political, and legal developments in the PRC or changes in government relations between China and the United States or other governments. There is significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and China with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs.\nThe PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the extent of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the PRC government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the government. In addition, the PRC government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies.\nThe PRC government also exercises significant control over Chinas economic growth by allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, regulating financial services and institutions, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\nWhile the PRC economy has experienced significant growth in the past four decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. Since 2020 due to the global pandemic, growth of the Chinese economy has slowed down. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall PRC economy but may also have a negative effect on us. Our financial condition and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us. In addition, the PRC government has implemented in the past certain measures, including interest rate increases, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity.\nWe cannot assure you that the PRCs economy will continue to grow, or that if there is growth, such growth will be steady and uniform, or that if there is a slowdown, such slowdown will not have a negative effect on its business and results of operations.\nIn July 2021, the Chinese government provided new guidance on China-based companies raising capital outside of China, including through VIE arrangements. In light of such developments, the SEC has imposed enhanced disclosure requirements on China-based companies seeking to register securities with the SEC. As substantially all of our operations are based in China, any future Chinese, U.S. or other rules and regulations that place restrictions on capital raising or other activities by China based companies could adversely affect our business and results of operations. If the business environment in China deteriorates from the perspective of domestic or international investment, or if relations between China and the United States or other governments deteriorate, the Chinese government may intervene with our operations and our business in China and in the United States.\nDifficulties in registering our products for sale in Mainland China could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough Baijiakang Consulting has obtained all required approval documents for its current health nutritional products, if it expands into different markets, it may need to apply for additional licenses. This process may involve an extended period of time and significant man-hours and may delay us from offering new health and nutritional products for sale or prevent us from launching new product initiatives.\nFor example, products marketed in China as health foods or for which certain claims are used are subject to blue cap or blue hat registrations, which involve extensive laboratory and clinical analysis by governmental authorities. This registration process can take anywhere from 18 months to 3 years, but may be substantially longer. We currently market dietary supplements. However, if government officials should determine that our products should be categorized as health foods, this could end or limit our ability to market such products in China and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us.\nWe conduct substantially all of business through our operating subsidiary in the PRC. Our PRC subsidiary, the VIE and subsidiaries of the VIE are subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to FIEs as well as various PRC laws and regulations generally applicable to companies incorporated in China. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, a series of new PRC laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, since these laws and regulations are relatively new and the PRC legal system continues to evolve rapidly, the interpretations of many laws, regulations, and rules are not always uniform, and enforcement of these laws, regulations, and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to you and us.\nFrom time to time, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights. Any administrative and court proceedings in China may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Since PRC administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory provisions and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy than in more developed legal systems. These uncertainties may impede our ability to enforce the contracts we have entered into and could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFurthermore, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all and may have retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of any of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. Such unpredictability towards our contractual, property (including intellectual property) and procedural rights could adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operations.\nWe may become subject to a variety of PRC laws and other regulations regarding data security or securities offerings that are conducted overseas and/or other foreign investment in China-based issuers, and any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our shares to investors and cause the value of our shares to significantly decline or be worthless.\nOn June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress enacted the PRC Data Security Law, which took effect on September 1, 2021. The law requires data collection to be conducted in a legitimate and proper manner and stipulates that, for the purpose of data protection, data processing activities must be conducted based on data classification and hierarchical protection system for data security.\nOn July 6, 2021, the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued a document to crack down on certain activities in the securities market and promote the high-quality development of the capital markets, which, among other things, requires the relevant governmental authorities to strengthen cross-border oversight of law-enforcement and judicial cooperation, to enhance supervision over China-based companies listed overseas and to establish and improve the system of extraterritorial application of the PRC securities laws.\nOn August 20, 2021, the 30th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 13th National Peoples Congress voted and passed the Personal Information Protection Law of the Peoples Republic of China, or the PRC Personal Information Protection Law, which became effective on November 1, 2021. The PRC Personal Information Protection Law applies to the processing of personal information of natural persons within the territory of China that is carried out outside of China where (1) such processing is for the purpose of providing products or services for natural persons within China, (2) such processing is to analyze or evaluate the behavior of natural persons within China, or (3) there are any other circumstances stipulated by related laws and administrative regulations.\nOn December 24, 2021, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), together with other relevant government authorities in China issued the Provisions of the State Council on the Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies and the Measures for the Filing of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies. The Overseas Listing Regulations requires that a PRC domestic enterprise seeking to issue and list its shares overseas (Overseas Issuance and Listing) shall complete the filing procedures of and submit the relevant information to CSRC. The Overseas Issuance and Listing includes direct and indirect issuance and listing. Where an enterprise whose principal business activities are conducted in the PRC seeks to issue and list its shares in the name of an overseas enterprise (Overseas Issuer) on the basis of the equity, assets, income or other similar rights and interests of the relevant PRC domestic enterprise, such activities shall be deemed an indirect overseas issuance and listing (Indirect Overseas Issuance and Listing) under the Overseas Listing Regulations.\nOn December 28, 2021, the CAC jointly with the relevant authorities formally published Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021) which took effect on February 15, 2022 and replace the former Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2020) issued on April 13, 2020. Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021) stipulates that operators of critical information infrastructure purchasing network products and services and online platform operators (together with the operators of critical information infrastructure, the Operators) carrying out data processing activities that affect or may affect national security, shall conduct a cybersecurity review, any and online platform operator who controls more than one million users personal information must go through a cybersecurity review by the cybersecurity review office if it seeks to be listed in a foreign country.\nOur Hong Kong and PRC subsidiaries may in the future collect and store certain data (including certain personal information) from our customers, who may be PRC individuals, in connection with our business and operations and for Know Your Customers purposes (to combat money laundering). Given that: (i) two of our Hong Kong subsidiaries are incorporated and located in Hong Kong and the other PRC subsidiary is incorporated and located in China; (ii) we have a PRC subsidiary engaged in business operations in mainland China; and (iii) pursuant to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (the Basic Law), which is a national law of the PRC and the constitutional document for Hong Kong, national laws of the PRC shall not be applied in Hong Kong, except for those listed in Annex III of the Basic Law (which is confined to laws relating to defense and foreign affairs, as well as other matters outside the autonomy of Hong Kong), we currently may expect the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021), the PRC Personal Information Protection Law and the Overseas Listing Regulations to have an impact on our Hong Kong and PRC subsidiaries.\nThese statements and regulatory actions are new, and it is highly uncertain how soon the legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any. It is also highly uncertain what the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on the daily business operations of our Hong Kong or PRC subsidiaries, their respective abilities to accept foreign investments and the listing of our shares on a U.S. or other foreign exchanges. There remains significant uncertainty in the interpretation and enforcement of relevant PRC cybersecurity laws and regulations. If the Overseas Listing Regulations are adopted into law in the future and becomes applicable to our Hong Kong or PRC subsidiaries, if any of our Honk Kong or PRC subsidiaries is deemed to be an Operator required to file for cybersecurity review before listing in the United States or if the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021) or the PRC Personal Information Protection Law becomes applicable to our PRC subsidiaries, the business operations of our Hong Kong or PRC subsidiaries and the listing of our shares in the United States could be subject to the CACs cybersecurity review or CSRC Overseas Issuance and Listing review in the future. If our Hong Kong or PRC subsidiaries become subject to the CAC or CSRC review, we cannot assure you that our Hong Kong or PRC subsidiaries will be able to comply with the regulatory requirements in all respects, and the current practice of collecting and processing personal information may be ordered to be rectified or terminated by regulatory authorities. In the event of a failure to comply, our Operating Subsidiaries may become subject to fines and other penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial condition, may hinder our ability in the future to offer our shares to investors and cause the value of our shares to significantly decline or be worthless.\nIf the Chinese government chooses to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, such action may significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer shares to investors and cause the value of our shares to significantly decline or be worthless. As of the date of this Annual Report, we believe that we are in full compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the CAC and CSRC and associated policies as issued to current date.\nThese recent statements, laws, and regulations by the Chinese government, including the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021), the PRC Personal Information Protection Law and the Overseas Listing Regulations, have indicated an intent to exert greater oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investments in China-based issuers. It is uncertain whether the Chinese government will adopt additional requirements or extend the existing requirements to apply to our Hong Kong subsidiaries located in Hong Kong. We could be subject to approval or review by Chinese regulatory authorities to pursue any future offerings. Any future action by the PRC government expanding the categories of industries and companies whose foreign securities offerings are subject to review by the CSRC could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.\nWe may face obstacles from the communist system in the PRC.\nForeign companies conducting operations in the PRC face significant political, economic, and legal risks. The communist regime in the PRC may hinder Western investment in the Company.\nWe may have difficulty establishing adequate management, legal, and financial controls in the PRC.\nThe PRC historically has been deficient in Western style management and financial reporting concepts and practices, as well as in modern banking, computer, and other control systems. We may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified employees to work in the PRC. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet Western standards.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection. These laws and regulations can be complex and stringent, and many are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, which could result in claims, changes to its data and other business practices, regulatory investigations, penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise affect its business. Although we believe we currently are not required to obtain clearance from the Cyberspace Administration of China under the recently enacted or proposed regulations or rules, we face uncertainties as to the interpretation or implementation of such regulations or rules, and if required, whether such clearance can be timely obtained, or at all.\nRegulatory authorities in China have implemented and are considering further legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. New laws and regulations that govern new areas of data protection or impose more stringent requirements may be introduced in China. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in China are often uncertain, in flux and complicated, including differentiated requirements for different groups of people or different types of data.\nThese recent statements, laws, and regulations by the Chinese government, including the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021), the PRC Personal Information Protection Law and the Overseas Listing Regulations, have indicated an intent to exert greater oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investments in China-based issuers. The PRC regulatory and enforcement regime with regard to privacy and data security is evolving. The PRC Cybersecurity Law provides that personal information and important data collected and generated by operators of critical information infrastructure in the course of their operations in the PRC should be stored in the PRC, and the law imposes heightened regulation and additional security obligations on operators of critical information infrastructure. According to the Cybersecurity Review Measures promulgated by the Cyberspace Administration of China and certain other PRC regulatory authorities in April 2020, which became effective in June 2020, operators of critical information infrastructure must pass a cybersecurity review when purchasing network products and services which do or may affect national security. We do not believe that our company constitutes a critical information infrastructure operator pursuant to the Cybersecurity Review Measures that became effective in April 2020. The PRC government is increasingly focused on data security, recently launching cybersecurity review against a number of mobile apps operated by several US-listed Chinese companies and prohibiting these apps from registering new users during the review period. It is uncertain whether the Chinese government will adopt additional requirements or extend the existing requirements to apply to our Hong Kong subsidiaries located in Hong Kong. We could be subject to approval or review by Chinese regulatory authorities to pursue any future offerings. Any future action by the PRC government expanding the categories of industries and companies whose foreign securities offerings are subject to review by the CSRC could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.\nOn July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the Measures for Cybersecurity Review for public comments, which proposes to authorize the relevant government authorities to conduct cybersecurity review on a range of activities that affect or may affect national security, including listings in foreign countries by companies that possess the personal data of more than one million users. The PRC National Security Law defines various types of national security, including technology security and information security.\nOn November 14, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China released the Regulations on Network Data Security . The Regulations on Network Data Security provide that data processors refer to individuals or organizations that autonomously determine the purpose and the manner of processing data. If a data processor that processes personal data of more than one million users intends to list overseas, it shall apply for a cybersecurity review. In addition, data processors that process important data or are listed overseas shall carry out an annual data security assessment on their own or by engaging a data security services institution, and the data security assessment report for the prior year should be submitted to the local cyberspace affairs administration department before January 31 of each year.\nWe currently have less than one million registered users on our digital and only require and obtain user information after users register with it. Given that we sell and service products through our digital platform, we may constitute a data processor, but the number of our online registered users is far less than one million. As a result, we would not be required to apply for a cybersecurity review under the Measures for Cybersecurity Review or the Regulations on Network Data Security. Nevertheless, the Measures for Cybersecurity Review or the Regulations on Network Data Security may be subject to further changes Although we believe we currently are not required to obtain clearance from the Cyberspace Administration of China under the Measures for Cybersecurity Review , the Regulations on Network Data Security or the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities, we face uncertainties as to the interpretation or implementation of such regulations or rules and we may in the future be required to perform a data security assessment annually either by ourselves or by retaining a third party data security service provider and submitting such data security assessment report to the local agency every year under the draft Regulations on Network Data Security\nOn June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress of China promulgated the Data Security Law which took effect on September 1, 2021. The Data Security Law provides for data security and privacy obligations of entities and individuals carrying out data activities, prohibits entities and individuals in China from providing any foreign judicial or law enforcement authority with any data stored in China without approval from competent PRC authority, and sets forth the legal liabilities of entities and individuals found to be in violation of their data protection obligations, including rectification order, warning, fines of up to RMB10 million, suspension of relevant business, and revocation of business permits or licenses.\nOn August 20, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress of China promulgated the Personal Information Protection Law which took effect on November 1, 2021. In addition to other rules and principles of personal information processing, the Personal Information Protection Law specifically provides rules for processing sensitive personal information. Sensitive personal information refers to personal information that, once leaked or illegally used, could easily lead to the infringement of human dignity or harm to the personal or property safety of an individual, including biometric recognition, religious belief, specific identity, medical and health, financial account, personal whereabouts, and other information of an individual, as well as any personal information of a minor under the age of 14. Only where there is a specific purpose and sufficient necessity, and under circumstances where strict protection measures are taken, may personal information processors process sensitive personal information. A personal information processor shall inform the individual of the necessity of processing such sensitive personal information and the impact thereof on the individuals rights and interests. As uncertainties remain regarding the interpretation and implementation of the Personal Information Protection Law, we cannot assure you that we will comply with the Personal Information Protection Law in all respects and regulatory authorities may order us to rectify or terminate our current practice of collecting and processing sensitive personal information.\nCompliance with the PRC Cybersecurity Law, the PRC National Security Law, the Data Security Law, the Cybersecurity Review Measures, the Personal Information Protection Law, as well as additional laws and regulations that PRC regulatory bodies may enact in the future, may result in additional expenses to us and subject us to negative publicity, which could harm our reputation among users and negatively affect the trading price of our common stock in the future. PRC regulators, including the Department of Public Security, the MIIT, the SAMR and the CAC, have been increasingly focused on regulation in the areas of data security and data protection, and are enhancing the protection of privacy and data security by rulemaking and enforcement actions at central and local levels. We expect that these areas will receive greater and continued attention and scrutiny from regulators and the public going forward, which could increase our compliance costs and subject us to heightened risks and challenges associated with data security and protection. If we are unable to manage these risks, we could become subject to penalties, including fines, suspension of business, prohibition against new user registration (even for a short period of time) and revocation of required licenses, and our reputation and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAny failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with the above and other regulatory requirements or privacy protection-related laws, rules and regulations could result in reputational damages or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, consumers, or others. These proceedings or actions could subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our data and other business practices, increase our costs and severely disrupt our business, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock.\nYou may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us.\nMost of our assets are located outside of the United States and most of our current operations are conducted in the PRC. In addition, all of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of countries other than the United States. A substantial portion of the assets of these persons is located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts judgments on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors, most of whom are not residents in the United States and the substantial majority of whose assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts. Our counsel as to PRC law has advised us that the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. Courts in China may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based on treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made or on reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other arrangements that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments with the United States. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in the PRC will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates basic principles of PRC law or national sovereignty, security, or the public interest. So, it is uncertain whether a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United States.\nThe PRC government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities.\nThe PRC government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property, and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations.\nAccordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties or joint ventures.\nOur Operating Subsidiary and the VIE may not be able to obtain or maintain all necessary licenses, permits, and approvals and to make all necessary registrations and filings for their business activities in the PRC and related to residents therein, especially in light of the nature of our VIE business operations, which includes the sale of health related products.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, our Operating Subsidiary and VIE have received all necessary governmental approvals and licenses for operations in the PRC, including the business approvals and licenses issued by the PRC State Administration for Market Regulation, and neither of them has been denied any such approvals. However, in the event that our Operating Subsidiary or our VIE erroneously concluded that certain licenses, permits, or approvals are not required or if applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change and it is required to obtain additional permissions or approvals in the future, our Operating Subsidiary and VIE may incur significant costs and expenses and may need to budget additional resources to comply with any such requirements. Moreover, if either of our Operating Subsidiary or VIE fails to renew its relevant licenses or filings or fails to obtain future required licenses, permits, or approvals, it may become subject to fines and other penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial condition.\nThe PRC legal system embodies uncertainties, which could limit law enforcement availability.\nThe PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, decided legal cases have little precedence. In 1979, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general. The overall effect of legislation over the past several decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investment in China. Our PRC operating subsidiary and affiliate is subject to PRC laws and regulations. However, these laws and regulations change frequently, and the interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties. For instance, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce the legal protection that we are entitled to by law or contract. However, since PRC administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting statutory and contractual terms, it may be difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative court proceedings and the level of law enforcement that we would receive in more developed legal systems. Such uncertainties, including the inability to enforce our contracts, could affect our business and operations. In addition, confidentiality protections in China may not be as effective as in the United States or other countries. Accordingly, we cannot predict the effect of future developments in the PRC legal system, particularly with regard to our business, including the promulgation of new laws. This may include changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, or the preemption of local regulations by national laws. These uncertainties could limit the availability of law enforcement, including our ability to enforce our agreements.\nTo the extent that our independent registered public accounting firms audit documentation related to their audit reports for the Company may, in the future, be located in China or in Hong Kong, our shares of common stock could be delisted and prohibited from trading on a U.S. exchange.\nThe HFCAA, as amended, prohibits foreign companies from listing their securities on U.S. exchanges if the companys auditor has been unavailable for PCAOB inspection or investigation for two consecutive years beginning in 2021. On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued the Determination Report, which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in (i) mainland China of the Peoples Republic of China because of a position taken by one or more authorities in mainland China; and (ii) Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in Hong Kong. In addition, the Determination Report identified specific registered public accounting firms subject to these determinations.\nOn August 26, 2022, the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol with the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of Finance of the PRC (the SOP). Pursuant to the SOP, the PCAOB has independent discretion to select any issuer audits for inspection or investigation and has the unfettered ability to transfer information to the SEC. The determinations as to mainland China and Hong Kong were vacated by the PCAOB as of December 15, 2022 as a result of the PCAOBs having been able to conduct extensive and thorough inspections and investigations of mainland China and Hong Kong firms in 2022 under the SOP; however, if the PCAOB encounters any impediment, in the future, to conducting an inspection or investigation of auditors in mainland China or Hong Kong as a result of a position taken by an authority in either jurisdiction, it may issue new determinations consistent with the HFCAA.\nWe engaged WWC, whose principal office is located in San Mateo, California, as our independent registered public accounting firm. Since WWC is not located in China or Hong Kong, WWC would not be subject to any determinations that may be announced by the PCAOB in the future with respect to auditors located in China or Hong Kong. We believe that the PCAOBs inspectors and investigators will have consistent access to the audit work performed by WWC for us. Therefore, we do not expect to be affected by the HFCAA at this time.\nHowever, to the extent that our auditors work papers may, in the future, become located in mainland China or in Hong Kong, such work papers may not be available for inspection by the PCAOB if authorities in the PRC or Hong Kong were to take a position at that time that would prevent the PCAOB from continuing to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China or Hong Kong. If such lack of inspection were to extend for the requisite period of time under the HFCAA, and if the PCAOB were then to issue new determinations based on its inability to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China or Hong Kong because of a position taken by an authority in those jurisdictions, our shares of common stock could be delisted and prohibited from trading on a U.S. exchange. In addition, if our auditors work papers were to become located in China or Hong Kong in the future, and thereby not be available for PCAOB inspection, our investors would be deprived of the benefits of the PCAOBs oversight of our auditor through such inspections, and they may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements. Also, we cannot assure you that U.S. regulatory authorities will not apply additional or more stringent criteria to us. Such uncertainty could cause the market price of our shares of common stock to be materially and adversely affected.\nThe enforcement of the PRC labor contract law may materially increase our costs and decrease our net income.\nChina adopted a new Labor Contract Law, effective on January 1, 2008, and issued its implementation rules, effective on September 18, 2008. The Labor Contract Law and related rules and regulations impose more stringent requirements on employers with regard to, among others, minimum wages, severance payment and non-fixed-term employment contracts, time limits for probation periods, as well as the duration and the times that an employee can be placed on a fixed-term employment contract. Due to the limited period of effectiveness of the Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules and regulations, and the lack of clarity with respect to their implementation and potential penalties and fines, it is uncertain how they will impact our current employment policies and practices. In particular, compliance with the Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules and regulations may increase our operating expenses. In the event that we decide to terminate some of our employees or otherwise change our employment or labor practices, the Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules and regulations may also limit our ability to effect those changes in a manner that we believe to be cost-effective or desirable and could result in a material decrease in our profitability.\nA downturn in the Hong Kong, China, or global economy, or a change in economic and political policies of China, could materially and adversely affect our Operating Subsidiarys business and financial condition.\nOur PRC subsidiarys business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations may be influenced to a significant degree by political, economic, and social conditions in Hong Kong and China generally. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the amount of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. While the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy but may have a negative effect on our PRC Operating Subsidiary.\nEconomic conditions in Hong Kong and China are sensitive to global economic conditions. Any prolonged slowdown in the global or Chinese economy may affect our current customers and potential customers businesses and have a negative impact on our Operating Subsidiaries business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, continued turbulence in the international markets may adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs.\nThere are political risks associated with conducting business in Hong Kong and China.\nAny adverse economic, social and/or political conditions, material social unrest, strike, riot, civil disturbance, or disobedience, as well as significant natural disasters, may affect the market and adversely affect our business operations. Hong Kong is a special administrative region of the PRC, and the basic policies of the PRC regarding Hong Kong are reflected in the Basic Law, Hong Kongs constitutional document, which provides Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy and executive, legislative and independent judicial powers, including that of final adjudication under the principle of one country, two systems. However, there is no assurance that there will not be any changes in the economic, political, and legal environment in either Hong Kong or China in the future. Since our operation are based in China and we have subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong, any change of such political arrangements may pose immediate threat to the stability of the economy in Hong Kong or China, thereby directly and adversely affecting our results of operations and financial positions.\nUnder the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the Peoples Republic of China, Hong Kong is exclusively in charge of its internal affairs and external relations, while the government of the PRC is responsible for its foreign affairs and defense. As a separate customs territory, Hong Kong maintains and develops relations with foreign states and regions. Based on certain recent developments, including the Law of the Peoples Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region issued by the Standing Committee of the PRC National Peoples Congress in June 2020, the U.S. State Department has indicated that the United States no longer considers Hong Kong to have significant autonomy from China and, at the time President Trump signed an executive order and Hong Kong Autonomy Act, or HKAA, to remove Hong Kongs preferential trade status and to authorize the U.S. administration to impose blocking sanctions against individuals and entities who are determined to have materially contributed to the erosion of Hong Kongs autonomy. The United States may impose the same tariffs and other trade restrictions on exports from Hong Kong that it places on goods from mainland China. These and other recent actions may represent an escalation in political and trade tensions involving the U.S, China, and Hong Kong, which could potentially harm our business.\nGiven the relatively small geographical size of Hong Kong, any of such incidents may have a widespread effect on our Operating Subsidiaries business operations, which could in turn adversely and materially affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. It is difficult to predict the full impact of the HKAA on Hong Kong and companies with operations in Hong Kong like us. Furthermore, legislative, or administrative actions in respect of China-U.S. relations could cause investor uncertainty for affected issuers, including us, and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nFuture inflation in China may inhibit our ability to conduct business in China.\nIn recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and highly fluctuating rates of inflation. During the past ten years, the rate of inflation in China has been as high as 5.9% and as low as -0.8%. These factors have led to the adoption by the Chinese government, from time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation. High inflation may in the future cause the Chinese government to impose controls on credit and/or prices, or to take other action, which could inhibit economic activity in China, and thereby harm the market for our products and our company.\nRestrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our sales effectively.\nCurrently, all of our revenues are settled in RMB, and any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use revenue generated in RMB to fund any future business activities outside China or to make dividend or other payments in U.S. dollars. Although the Chinese government introduced regulations in 1996 to allow greater convertibility of the RMB for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain, including primarily the restriction that FIEs may only buy, sell or remit foreign currencies after providing valid commercial documents, at those banks in China authorized to conduct foreign exchange business. In addition, conversion of RMB for capital account items, including direct investment and loans, is subject to governmental approval in China, and companies are required to open and maintain separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account items. We cannot be certain that the Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of the RMB.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business and the value of our securities.\nThe value of our Shares will be indirectly affected by the foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and RMB and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated. Appreciation or depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. Fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we issue that will be exchanged into U.S. dollars, as well as earnings from, and the value of, any U.S. dollar-denominated investments we make in the future.\nSince July 2005, the RMB has no longer been pegged to the U.S. dollar. Although the Peoples Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market.\nVery limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currencies.\nFailure to make adequate contributions to various employee benefit plans as required by PRC regulations may subject us to penalties.\nCompanies operating in China are required to participate in various government sponsored employee benefit plans, including certain social insurance, housing funds and other welfare-oriented payment obligations, and contribute to the plans in amounts equal to certain percentages of salaries, including bonuses and allowances, of employees up to a maximum amount specified by the local government from time to time at locations where they operate their businesses. The requirement of employee benefit plans has not been implemented consistently by the local governments in China given the different levels of economic development in different locations. Our failure in making contributions to various employee benefit plans and in complying with applicable PRC labor-related laws may subject us to late payment penalties. We may be required to make up the contributions for these plans as well as to pay late fees and fines. If we are subject to late fees or fines in relation to the underpaid employee benefits, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiary to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, and any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiary to make payments to us could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business.\nWe rely principally on dividends and other distributions on equity from our PRC subsidiary for our cash requirements, including for servicing any debt we may incur. Our PRC subsidiarys ability to distribute dividends is based upon their distributable earnings. Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiary to pay dividends to its shareholders only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, our PRC subsidiary is required to set aside at least 10% of their after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of their registered capital. Our PRC subsidiaries, as foreign invested enterprises, (FIEs), are also required to further set aside a portion of their after-tax profit to fund an employee welfare fund, although the amount to be set aside, if any, is determined at their discretion. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. If our PRC subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments to us. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to distribute dividends or other payments to their shareholders could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nPRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds we receive from offshore financing activities to make loans to or make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand business.\nAny transfer of funds by us to our PRC subsidiary, either as a shareholder loan or as an increase in registered capital, is subject to approval by or registration or filing with relevant governmental authorities in China. According to the relevant PRC regulations on foreign-invested enterprises in China, capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries are subject to the approval of or filing with the Ministry of Commerce in its local branches and registration with a local bank authorized by SAFE. In addition, (i) any foreign loan procured by our PRC subsidiary is required to be registered with SAFE or its local branches or filed with SAFE in its information system; and (ii) our PRC subsidiary may not procure loans which exceed the difference between their total investment amount and registered capital or, as an alternative, only procure loans subject to the calculation approach and limitation as provided in the Peoples Bank of China Notice No. 9 (PBOC Notice No. 9). Any medium- or long-term loan to be provided by us to our PRC-based subsidiaries must be registered with the National Development and Reform Commission and SAFE or its local branches. We may not be able to obtain these government approvals or complete such registrations on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future capital contributions or foreign loans by us to our PRC subsidiary. If we fail to receive such approvals or complete such registration or filing, our ability to use the proceeds we receive from our offshore financing activities and to capitalize our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to fund and expand our business. There is, in effect, no statutory limit on the amount of capital contribution that we can make to our PRC subsidiary. This is because there is no statutory limit on the amount of registered capital for our PRC subsidiary, and we are allowed to make capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary by subscribing for their initial registered capital and increased registered capital, provided that the PRC subsidiary complete the relevant filing and registration procedures.\nWith respect to loans to our PRC subsidiary by us, (i) if the PRC subsidiary adopts the traditional foreign exchange administration mechanism, or the Current Foreign Debt Mechanism, the outstanding amount of the loans shall not exceed the difference between the total investment and the registered capital of the PRC subsidiary; and (ii) if the PRC subsidiary adopts the foreign exchange administration mechanism as provided in Notice of the Peoples Bank of China on Matters concerning the Macro-Prudential Management of Full-Covered Cross-Border Financing, or the PBOC Notice No. 9, the risk-weighted outstanding amount of the loans, which shall be calculated based on the formula provided in PBOC Notice No. 9, shall not exceed 200% of the net asset of the PRC subsidiary. According to the PBOC Notice No. 9, after a transition period of one year since the promulgation of PBOC Notice No. 9, the PBOC and SAFE will determine the cross-border financing administration mechanism for the foreign-invested enterprises after evaluating the overall implementation of PBOC Notice No. 9. As of the date of this Annual Report, neither the PBOC nor SAFE has promulgated and made public any further rules, regulations, notices or circulars in this regard. It is uncertain which mechanism will be adopted by the PBOC and SAFE in the future and what statutory limits will be imposed on us when providing loans to our PRC subsidiary. Currently, our PRC subsidiary has the flexibility to choose between the Current Foreign Debt Mechanism and the Notice No. 9 Foreign Debt Mechanism. However, if a more stringent foreign debt mechanism becomes mandatory, our ability to provide loans to our PRC subsidiary may be significantly limited, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Circular on Reforming the Administration of Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 19, effective as of June 1, 2015, as amended by Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming and Regulating Policies on the Control over Foreign Exchange Settlement under the Capital Account, or SAFE Circular 16, effective on June 9, 2016, allows FIEs to settle their foreign exchange capital at their discretion, but continues to prohibit FIEs from using the Renminbi fund converted from their foreign exchange capitals for expenditure beyond their business scopes, and also prohibit FIEs from using such Renminbi fund to provide loans to persons other than affiliates unless otherwise permitted under our business scope. As a result, we are required to apply Renminbi funds converted from the net proceeds we received from our offshore financing activities within the business scopes of our PRC subsidiary. SAFE Circular 19 and SAFE Circular 16 may significantly limit our ability to use Renminbi converted from the net proceeds from our offshore financing activities to fund the establishment of new entities in China by our PRC subsidiary, to invest in or acquire any other PRC company through our PRC subsidiary, or to establish new consolidated subsidiary in China, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRestrictions under PRC law on our PRC subsidiaries ability to pay dividends and make other distributions could materially and adversely affect our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could benefit our business, pay dividends to you, and otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nSubstantially all of our sales are earned by our PRC subsidiary and the VIE. As a holding company, we will rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our Hong Kong and PRC subsidiaries for our cash and financing requirements Our subsidiaries are permitted under the respective laws of China and Hong Kong to provide funding to us through dividends without restrictions on the amount of the funds, other than as limited by the amount of their distributable earnings. However, to the extent that cash is in our Hong Kong or PRC subsidiaries, there is a possibility that the funds may not be available to fund our operations or for other uses outside of the PRC or Hong Kong due to interventions or the imposition of restrictions and limitations by the PRC or the Hong Kong government on the ability to transfer cash. If any of our subsidiaries incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing such debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to us. As of the date of this Annual Report, our subsidiaries have not experienced any difficulties or limitations on their ability to transfer cash between each other; nor do they maintain cash management policies or procedures dictating the amount of such funding or how funds are transferred. None of our subsidiaries have paid any dividends, other distributions or transferred assets to our holding company as of the date of this Annual Report. In the future, cash proceeds raised from overseas financing activities may be transferred by us to our Hong Kong or PRC subsidiaries via capital contribution or shareholder loans, as the case may be. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not made any transfers, paid any dividends, or made any distributions to U.S. investors.\nMoreover, PRC legal restrictions permit payments of dividends by our PRC subsidiaries only out of their accumulated after-tax profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Our PRC subsidiaries are also required under PRC laws and regulations to allocate at least 10% of their annual after-tax profits determined in accordance with PRC generally accepted accounting principles to a statutory general reserve fund until the amount in said fund reaches 50% of their registered capital. Allocations to these statutory reserve funds can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to us in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends. Any limitations on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to transfer funds to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nThe PRC government may issue further restrictive measures in the future.\nWe cannot assure you that the PRCs government will not issue further restrictive measures in the future. The PRC governments restrictive regulations and measures could increase our operating costs in adapting to these regulations and measures, limit our access to capital resources or even restrict our business operations, which could further adversely affect our business and prospects.\nIf our PRC subsidiary or consolidated affiliated entity are found incompliant with the employment and social security, taxation, marketing, telecommunication, or other rules of China, they may face penalties imposed by the PRC government.\nOur PRC subsidiary and consolidated affiliated entity failed to strictly comply with PRC laws and regulations to contribute towards social insurance premium and housing fund on behalf of their employees, as required by the applicable laws and regulations. We may be required by relevant authorities to make up the shortfall of social insurance premium and housing fund. Although we have made efforts to settle tax payables and take compliance measures, if any PRC government authority takes the position that there is non-compliance with the taxation, marketing, telecommunication, or other rules by our PRC subsidiary or consolidated affiliated entity, they may be exposed to penalties from PRC government authorities, in which case the operation and financial conditions of our PRC subsidiary or consolidated affiliated entity may be adversely affected.\nUnder the Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be classified as a resident enterprise of China. Such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC stockholders.\nOn March 16, 2007, the National Peoples Congress of China passed the EIT Law, and on November 28, 2007, the State Council of China passed its implementing rules, which took effect on January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with de facto management bodies within China is considered a resident enterprise, meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the EIT Law define de facto management as substantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties of the enterprise.\nOn April 22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation issued the Notice Concerning Relevant Issues Regarding Cognizance of Chinese Investment Controlled Enterprises Incorporated Offshore as Resident Enterprises pursuant to Criteria of de facto Management Bodies, or the Notice, further interpreting the application of the EIT Law and its implementation non-Chinese enterprise or group controlled offshore entities. Pursuant to the Notice, an enterprise incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction and controlled by a Chinese enterprise or group will be classified as a non-domestically incorporated resident enterprise if (i) its senior management in charge of daily operations reside or perform their duties mainly in China; (ii) its financial or personnel decisions are made or approved by bodies or persons in China; (iii) its substantial assets and properties, accounting books, corporate chops, board and shareholder minutes are kept in China; and (iv) at least half of its directors with voting rights or senior management often resident in China. A resident enterprise would be subject to an enterprise income tax rate of 25% on its worldwide income and must pay a withholding tax at a rate of 10% when paying dividends to its non-PRC shareholders. However, it remains unclear as to whether the Notice is applicable to an offshore enterprise incorporated by a Chinese natural person. Nor are detailed measures on imposition of tax from non-domestically incorporated resident enterprises are available. Therefore, it is unclear how tax authorities will determine tax residency based on the facts of each case.\nWe may be deemed to be a resident enterprise by Chinese tax authorities. If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. First, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. In our case, this would mean that income such as interest on financing proceeds and non-China source income would be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Second, although under the EIT Law and its implementing rules dividends paid to us from our PRC subsidiaries would qualify as tax-exempt income, we cannot guarantee that such dividends will not be subject to a 10% withholding tax, as the PRC foreign exchange control authorities, which enforce the withholding tax, have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as resident enterprises for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. Finally, it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new resident enterprise classification could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC stockholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC stockholders from transferring our shares.\nIf we were treated as a resident enterprise by PRC tax authorities, we would be subject to taxation in both the U.S. and China, and our PRC tax may not be creditable against our U.S. tax.\nWe face uncertainty with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their non-PRC holding companies.\nOn February 3, 2015, the SAT issued the Public Notice Regarding Certain Corporate Income Tax Matters on Indirect Transfer of Properties by Non-Tax Resident Enterprises, or SAT Bulletin 7, which came into effect on the same day, revised in October 2017 and December 2017. SAT Bulletin 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to transactions involving the transfer of taxable assets through offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. In addition, SAT Bulletin 7 has introduced safe harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities market. SAT Bulletin 7 also brings challenges to both foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of taxable assets, as such persons need to determine whether their transactions are subject to these rules and whether any withholding obligation applies.\nOn October 17, 2017, the SAT issued the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Concerning the Withholding of Non-Resident Enterprise Income Tax at Source, or SAT Bulletin 37, which came into effect on December 1, 2017, and revised in June 2018. The SAT Bulletin 37 further clarifies the practice and procedure of the withholding of non-resident enterprise income tax.\nWhere a non-resident enterprise transfers taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, which is an Indirect Transfer, the non-resident enterprise as either transferor or transferee, or the PRC entity that directly owns the taxable assets, may report such. Indirect Transfer to the relevant tax authority. Using a substance over form principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding, or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such Indirect Transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who pays for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise. Both the transferor and the transferee may be subject to penalties under PRC tax laws if the transferee fails to withhold the taxes and the transferor fails to pay the taxes.\nWe face uncertainties as to the reporting and other implications of certain past and future transactions where PRC taxable assets are involved, such as offshore restructuring, sale of the shares in our offshore subsidiaries and investments. Our company may be subject to filing obligations or may be taxed if our company is transferor in such transactions and may be subject to withholding obligations if our company is transferee in such transactions, under SAT Bulletin 7 and/or SAT Bulletin 37. For transfers of shares of our company by investors who are non-PRC resident enterprises, our PRC subsidiaries may be requested to assist in the filing under SAT Bulletin 7 and/or SAT Bulletin 37. As a result, we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with SAT Bulletin 7 and/or SAT Bulletin 37 or to request the relevant transferors from whom we purchase taxable assets to comply with these circulars, or to establish that our company should not be taxed under these circulars, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nPRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident shareholders to penalties and limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiary and its VIE, limit our PRC subsidiarys ability to distribute profits to us, or otherwise adversely affect us.\nThe SAFE promulgated the notice on relevant issues relating to domestic residents investment and financing and roundtrip investment through special purpose vehicles (SPV(s)), or Notice 37, in July 2014 that requires PRC residents or entities to register with SAFE or its local branch in connection with their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing. In addition, such PRC residents or entities must update their SAFE registrations when the offshore SPV undergoes material events relating to material change of capitalization or structure of the PRC resident itself (such as capital increase, capital reduction, share transfer or exchange, merger or spin off).On February 28, 2015, SAFE issued a notice according to which the aforesaid PRC residents or entities are no longer required to register with SAFE or its local branch, instead the aforesaid PRC residents or entities need to register with local banks. We have notified substantial beneficial owners of our ordinary shares who we know are PRC residents of their filing obligation, and to the best of our knowledge, most of those shareholders whom we know are PRC residents have completed the registration. However, we may not be aware of the identities of all our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. In addition, we do not have control over our beneficial owners and cannot assure you that all of our PRC resident beneficial owners will comply with SAFE Circular 37. Failure by an individual to comply with the required SAFE registration and updating requirements described above may result in penalties up to RMB50, 000 imposed on such individual and restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the PRC subsidiaries of such offshore SPV, including increasing the registered capital of payment of dividends and other distributions to, and receiving capital injections for the offshore SPV. Failure to comply with Notice 37 may also subject relevant PRC resident beneficial owners or the PRC subsidiaries of such offshore SPV to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions.\nFailure to comply with the individual foreign exchange rules relating to the overseas direct investment or the engagement in the issuance or trading of securities overseas by our PRC resident stockholders may subject such stockholders to fines or other liabilities.\nOther than Notice 37, our ability to conduct foreign exchange activities in the PRC may be subject to the interpretation and enforcement of the implementation rules of the administrative measures for individual foreign exchange promulgated by SAFE in January 2007 (as amended and supplemented, the Individual Foreign Exchange Rules). Under the individual foreign exchange rules, any PRC individual seeking to make a direct investment overseas or engage in the issuance or trading of negotiable securities or derivatives overseas must make the appropriate registrations in accordance with SAFE provisions. PRC individuals who fail to make such registrations may be subject to warnings, fines or other liabilities.\nWe may not be fully informed of the identities of all our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. For example, because the investment in or trading of our shares will happen in an overseas public or secondary market where shares are often held with brokers in brokerage accounts, it is unlikely that we will know the identity of all of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. Furthermore, we have no control over any of our future beneficial owners and we cannot assure you that such PRC residents will be able to complete the necessary approval and registration procedures required by the individual foreign exchange rules.\nIt is uncertain how the individual foreign exchange rules will be interpreted or enforced and whether such interpretation or enforcement will affect our ability to conduct foreign exchange transactions. Because of this uncertainty, we cannot be sure whether the failure by any of our PRC resident stockholders to make the required registration will subject our PRC subsidiary to fines or legal sanctions on its operations, delay or restriction on repatriation of proceeds of any future offering into the PRC, restriction on remittance of dividends or other punitive actions that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Chinese anti-corruption laws, and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act, or FCPA, and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, agreements with third parties, and make most of our sales in China. The PRC also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials. Our activities in China create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by the employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors of our Company, even though they may not always be subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors of our Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or Chinese anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.\nFluctuation of the RMB may affect our financial condition by affecting the volume of cross-border money flow.\nThe value of the RMB fluctuates and is subject to changes in the PRCs political and economic conditions. Since July 2005, the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies, including USD, has been based on rates set by the Peoples Bank of China, which are set based on the interbank foreign exchange market rates and the current exchange rates of a basket of currencies on the world financial markets.\nIf we become directly subject to the recent scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations, stock price and reputation and could result in a loss of your investment in our stock, especially if such matter cannot be addressed and resolved favorably.\nRecently, U.S. public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China, particularly companies like us which have completed so-called reverse merger transactions, have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism, and negative publicity by investors, financial commentators, and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism, and negative publicity has centered around financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies, or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the scrutiny, criticism, and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies has sharply decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits and SEC enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect this sector-wide scrutiny, criticism, and negative publicity will have on our Company, our business, and our stock price. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend our Company. This situation would be costly and time consuming and distract our management from growing our Company.\nThe disclosures in our reports and other filings with the SEC and our other public pronouncements are not subject to the scrutiny of any regulatory bodies in the PRC. Accordingly, our public disclosure should be reviewed in light of the fact that no governmental agency that is located in China where substantially all of our operations and business are located has conducted any due diligence on our operations or reviewed or cleared any of our disclosure.\nWe are regulated by the SEC and our reports and other filings with the SEC are subject to SEC review in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Unlike public reporting companies whose operations are located primarily in the United States, however, substantially all of our operations are located in China. Since substantially all of our operations and business takes place in China, it may be more difficult for the staff of the SEC to overcome the geographic and cultural obstacles that are present when reviewing our disclosure. These same obstacles are not present for similar companies whose operations or business take place entirely or primarily in the United States. Furthermore, our SEC reports and other disclosure and public pronouncements are not subject to the review or scrutiny of any PRC regulatory authority. For example, the disclosure in our SEC reports and other filings are not subject to the review of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, a PRC regulator that is tasked with oversight of the capital markets in China. Accordingly, you should review our SEC reports, filings, and other public pronouncements with the understanding that no local regulator has done any due diligence on our Company and with the understanding that none of our SEC reports, other filings, or any of our other public pronouncements has been reviewed or otherwise been scrutinized by any local regulator.\nRisks Related to the Market for Our Securities\nIf the Chinese government chooses to exert greater oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China based issuers, such action could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to overseas investors and cause such securities to significantly decline in value or to be worthless.\nRecent statements by the Chinese government have indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investments in China based issuers. The PRC has recently proposed new rules that would require companies collecting or holding large amounts of data to undergo a cybersecurity review prior to listing in foreign countries, a move that would significantly tighten oversight over China based Internet giants. Pursuant to Article 6 of the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021 Version), companies holding data on more than 1 million users must now apply for cybersecurity approval when seeking listings in other nations due to the risk that such data and personal information could be affected, controlled, and maliciously exploited by foreign governments.\nWe are in the business of developing and marketing of health products and supplements, which does not involve the collection of user data, implicate cybersecurity or involve any other type of restricted industry. Based on our understanding of currently applicable PRC laws and regulations, the shares of common stock are not subject to the review or prior approval of the CAC or the CRSC. Uncertainties still exist, however, due to the possibility that laws, regulations or policies in the PRC could change rapidly in the future. Any future action by the PRC government expanding the categories of industries and companies whose foreign securities offerings are subject to review by the CRSC or the CAC could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to overseas investors and could cause such securities to significantly decline in value or to be worthless.\nThe market price for our shares could be adversely affected by increased tensions between the United States and China.\nRecently, there have been heightened tensions in the economic and political relations between the United States and China. On June 30, 2020, the Standing Committee of the PRC National Peoples Congress issued the Law of the Peoples Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). This law defines the duties and government bodies of the HKSAR for safeguarding national security and four categories of offences-secession, subversion, terrorist activities and collusion with a foreign country or external elements to endanger national security-and their corresponding penalties. On July 14, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump signed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, or HKAA, into law, authorizing the U.S. administration to impose blocking sanctions against individuals and entities who are determined to have materially contributed to the erosion of Hong Kongs autonomy. On August 7, 2020 the U.S. government imposed HKAA-authorized sanctions on eleven individuals, including HKSAR chief executive Carrie Lam. The HKAA further authorizes secondary sanctions, including the imposition of blocking sanctions, against foreign financial institutions that knowingly conduct a significant transaction with foreign persons sanctioned under this authority. The imposition of sanctions such as those provided in the HKAA is in practice discretionary and highly political, especially in a relationship as extensive and complex as that between the United States and China. It is difficult to predict the full impact of the HKAA on Hong Kong and companies like the Company. Furthermore, legislative or administrative actions in respect of Sino-U.S. relations could cause investor uncertainty for affected issuers, including us, and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nIf the market price of our common stock drops below $5.00 per share, we may be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions, and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called penny stocks to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. Our common stock is a penny stock and is subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the Penny Stock Rule. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual incomes exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouses). For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market, thus possibly making it more difficult for us to raise additional capital.\nFor any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock.\nThere can be no assurance that our common stock will not trade for less than $5.00 per share or that we would qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our common stock were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.\nIt may be difficult for overseas regulators to conduct investigations or collect evidence within China.\nShareholder claims or regulatory investigations that are common in the United States generally are difficult to pursue as a matter of law or practicality in China. For example, in China, there are significant legal and other obstacles to providing information needed for regulatory investigations or litigation initiated outside China. While the authorities in China may establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities regulatory authorities of another country or region to implement cross-border supervision and administration, such cooperation with the securities regulatory authorities in the United States may not be efficient in the absence of a mutual and practical cooperation mechanism. Furthermore, according to Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law, or Article 177, which became effective in March 2020, no overseas securities regulator is allowed to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within the territory of the PRC. While detailed interpretation or implementation of the rules under Article 177 have yet to be promulgated, the inability of an overseas securities regulator to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within China may result in difficulties faced by our shareholders in protecting their interests.\nThere may be conflicts of interest between our management and our non-management shareholders.\nConflicts of interest create the risk that our officers and directors may have an incentive to act adversely to the interests of the Company. A conflict of interest may arise between our officers and directors personal pecuniary interests and their fiduciary duty to our shareholders.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over our financial reporting. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, shareholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the future trading price of our shares of common stocks.\nDuring the fiscal years ended 2021 and 2022, the Company was dormant and had no internal controls implemented over its financial reporting. We have engaged the services of WWC, P.C. as our independent registered public accounting firm, which is located in San Mateo, California. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, is designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal control could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the future trading price of our shares of common stock.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the Company. As defined in Regulation 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, we determined that we had the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting: (i) we had limited controls over information processing; (ii) we had inadequate segregation of duties; (iii) we did not have a formal audit committee with a financial expert; and (iv) we did not have sufficient formal written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP, and SEC guidelines.\nAs a result, we may appoint three independent directors, at least one of whom the Board would determine to be qualified as a financial expert under the applicable SEC rules, and form an audit committee to be comprised of three independent directors. However, although the financial statements and footnotes are now reviewed by our management, we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment of such transactions.\nEven if we develop effective internal controls over financial reporting, such controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with such policies or procedures may deteriorate, which could result in the discovery of additional material weaknesses and deficiencies. In any event, the process of determining whether our existing internal control over financial reporting is compliant with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Section 404) and is sufficiently effective requires the investment of substantial time and resources by our senior management. As a result, this process may divert internal resources and take a significant amount of time and effort to complete. In addition, we cannot predict the outcome of this process and whether we will need to implement remedial actions in order to establish effective controls over financial reporting. The determination of whether our internal controls are sufficient and any remedial actions required could result in our incurring additional costs that we did not anticipate, including the hiring of additional outside consultants. We may also fail to timely complete our evaluation, testing and any remediation required to comply with Section 404.\nPublic companies are required, pursuant to Section 404, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for as long as we are a smaller reporting company, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. While we could be a smaller reporting company for an indefinite period of time and thus relieved of the above-mentioned attestation requirement, an independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could detect problems that our managements or our audit committees assessment might not. Such undetected material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation.\nThe recent joint statement by the SEC, proposed rule changes submitted by Nasdaq, and an act passed by the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives, all call for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market companies. These developments could add uncertainties to our business operations, common stock price and reputation.\nU.S. public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China (including in Hong Kong) have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity by investors, financial commentators, and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism, and negative publicity has centered on financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto, and, in many cases, allegations of fraud.\nOn December 7, 2018, the SEC and the PCAOB issued a joint statement highlighting continued challenges faced by U.S. regulators in their oversight of financial statement audits of U.S.-listed companies with significant operations in China. On April 21, 2020, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and PCAOB Chairman William D. Duhnke III, along with other senior SEC staff, released a joint statement highlighting the risks associated with investing in companies based in or that have substantial operations in emerging markets including China, reiterating past SEC and PCAOB statements on matters including the difficulty associated with inspecting accounting firms and audit work papers in China, higher risks of fraud in emerging markets, and the difficulty of bringing and enforcing SEC, Department of Justice, and other U.S. regulatory actions, including in instances of fraud, in emerging markets generally.\nOn December 18, 2020, Congress enacted the HFCAA requiring foreign companies to certify that they are not owned or controlled by a foreign government if the PCAOB is unable to audit specified reports because the company uses a foreign auditor not subject to PCAOB inspection. If the PCAOB is unable to inspect the companys auditors for two consecutive years, the issuers securities are prohibited from trading on a national exchange.\nOn May 21, 2021, Nasdaq filed three proposals with the SEC to (i) apply a minimum offering size requirement for companies primarily operating in a Restrictive Market; (ii) prohibit Restrictive Market companies from directly listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and only permit them to list on the Nasdaq Global Select or Nasdaq Global Market in connection with a direct listing; and (iii) apply additional and more stringent criteria to an applicant or listed company based on the qualifications of the companys auditors.\nAs a result of this scrutiny, criticism, and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies sharply decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits and SEC enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect this sector-wide scrutiny, criticism, and negative publicity will have on us, our business, and our common stock price. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend ourselves. This situation would be costly and time consuming and would distract our management from developing our growth. If such allegations are not proven to be groundless, we and our business operations will be severely affected and you could sustain a significant decline in the value of our shares of common stock.\nTo the extent that our independent registered public accounting firms audit documentation related to their audit reports for the Company may, in the future, be located in China or in Hong Kong, our shares of common stock could be delisted and prohibited from trading on a U.S. exchange.\nThe HFCAA, as amended, prohibits foreign companies from listing their securities on U.S. exchanges if the companys auditor has been unavailable for PCAOB inspection or investigation for two consecutive years beginning in 2021. On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued the Determination Report, which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in (i) mainland China of the Peoples Republic of China because of a position taken by one or more authorities in mainland China; and (ii) Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in Hong Kong. In addition, the Determination Report identified specific registered public accounting firms subject to these determinations.\nOn August 26, 2022, the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol with the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of Finance of the PRC (the SOP). Pursuant to the SOP, the PCAOB has independent discretion to select any issuer audits for inspection or investigation and has the unfettered ability to transfer information to the SEC. The determinations as to mainland China and Hong Kong were vacated by the PCAOB as of December 15, 2022 as a result of the PCAOBs having been able to conduct extensive and thorough inspections and investigations of mainland China and Hong Kong firms in 2022 under the SOP; however, if the PCAOB encounters any impediment, in the future, to conducting an inspection or investigation of auditors in mainland China or Hong Kong as a result of a position taken by an authority in either jurisdiction, it may issue new determinations consistent with the HFCAA.\nEffective August 1, 2023, we have engaged WWC, LLP (WWC), whose principal office is located in San Mateo, California with an office in Hong Kong, as our new independent registered public accounting firm. Our financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, which were filed in the delinquent reports on Form 10-K, were audited by WWC to the best of its ability. Based on the PCAOBs current position and Chinas compliance with the SOP, we do not expect to be affected by the HFCAA at this time. However, should PRC authorities fail to facilitate the PCAOBs access in the future, the PCAOB may consider the need to issue a new determination, which may affect our ability to maintain the listing of our securities on a U.S. national securities exchange, including Nasdaq, and the trading of them in the over-the-counter trading market if our auditors work papers were, in the future, to become located in Hong Kong or China.\nIf our auditors work papers were to become located in China or Hong Kong, such work papers may not be available for inspection by the PCAOB if authorities in Hong Kong were to take a position at that time that would prevent the PCAOB from continuing to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in Hong Kong. If such lack of inspection were to extend for the requisite period of time under the HFCAA, and if the PCAOB were then to issue new determinations based on its inability to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in Hong Kong because of a position taken by an authority in those jurisdictions, our shares of common stock could be prohibited from trading on a U.S. exchange and delisted. In addition, our investors would be deprived of the benefits of the PCAOBs oversight of our auditor through such inspections, and they may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements. Also, we cannot assure you that U.S. regulatory authorities will not apply additional or more stringent criteria to us. Such uncertainty could cause the market price of our shares of common stock to be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common shares less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company until June 30, 2026, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if we become a large accelerated filer or if we have issued an aggregate of $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding 3 years. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nFor the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our shares of common stock. Accordingly, investors must be prepared to rely on sales of their shares of common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board deems relevant.\nFulfilling our obligations incident to being a public company, including with respect to the requirements of and related rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, is expensive and time-consuming, and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these obligations could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and our stock price.\nAs a public company, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the SEC require us to implement various corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements and complex accounting rules. Compliance with these public company obligations requires us to devote significant time and resources and places significant additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial accounting and information systems. Other expenses associated with being a public company include increased auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, increased directors fees and director and officer liability insurance costs, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses.\nWe are required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to document and test the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we are required under the Exchange Act to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain effective controls or implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results, or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. This could result in a decrease in the value of our shares of common stock. Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure will result in additional expenses.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC regulations, have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with accessing the public markets and public reporting. Our management team will need to invest significant management time and financial resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards for public companies, which will lead to increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Nevada law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our Board of Directors has the right to determine the authorized number of directors and to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to control the size of or fill vacancies on our Board of Directors. In addition, we are authorized to issue up to 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, in one or more classes or series as may be determined by our Board of Directors. The issuance of shares of common stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding voting stock. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nThe Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item because the Company is a smaller reporting company. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nAll land in China is owned by the State. Individuals and companies are permitted to acquire rights to use land or land use rights for specific purposes. In the case of land used for industrial purposes, the land use rights are granted for a certain period of no more than 50 years. This period may be renewed at the expiration of the initial and any subsequent term. Granted land use rights are transferable and may be used as security for borrowings and other obligations. We do not own or have not been granted land use rights to any property in China or any other countries.\nOwned Real Property\nNeither our Company nor the VIE owns any real property.\nLeased Real Property\nBaijiakang Consulting and its VIE, Liaoning Kangbaier, have entered into various lease arrangements in Beijing, the PRC, for their office and manufacturing spaces, which they believe are adequate and suitable for their current operations:\nProperty rental details\nLocation (within the Group Hospital) Area (m 2) use\nZhaojia # 1-17-1, Xinglongtai District,\nPanjin City factory building\nZhaojia # 1-17-1, Xinglongtai District,\nPanjin City storehouse\nZhaojia # 1-17-1, Xinglongtai District,\nPanjin City Office building (including WOFE)\nZhaojia # 1-17-1, Xinglongtai District,\nPanjin City dormitory building\namount to ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nOther than ordinary routine litigation (in which we are not currently involved), we know of no material, existing, or pending legal proceedings against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation, and there are no proceedings in which our director, officer, or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our Company. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nThe information required by Item 4 is not applicable to us, as we have no mining operations in the United States.\nPart II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur shares of common stock are traded on the OTC Pink Market. Our common stock trades on a limited and sporadic basis and there is no assurance that a regular public trading market will ever develop. OTC market securities are not listed and traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC market securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers. OTC market issuers are traditionally smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange.\nPrice Range of Common Stock\nThe following table shows, for the periods indicated, the high and low bid prices per share of our common stock as reported by the OTC Markets, Inc. These bid prices represent prices quoted by broker-dealers on the OTC Pink Market. The quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down, or commissions, and may not represent actual transactions.\nHigh Low\nFiscal Year 2022\nQuarter ended September 30, 2021 4.99 3.00\nQuarter ended, December 31,2021 4.99 4.99\nQuarter ended March 31, 2022 4.99 4.99\nQuarter ended June 30, 2022 4.99 4.99\nFiscal Year 2023\nQuarter ended September 30, 2022 4.99 4.99\nQuarter ended December 31, 2022 4.99 4.99\nQuarter ended March 31, 2023 4.99 4.99\nQuarter ended June 30, 2023 5.00 4.99\nQuarter ended September 30, 2023 5.00 5.00\n(1) Data derived from www.otcmarkets.com.\nHolders\nAs of June 30, 2023, there were nine registered holders of record of our common stock.\nDividends\nWe have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying such dividends in the foreseeable future. We will rely on dividends from our PRC operating entity for our funds and PRC regulations may limit the amount of funds distributed to us from our PRC operating entity, which will affect our ability to declare any dividends.\nStock Option and Warrant Grants\nWe have no stock options or warrants granted to our executives, employees, vendors, consultants, or any other parties as of the reporting date.\nRegistration Rights\nWe have not granted anyone any registration rights.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company has not adopted any equity compensation plan.\nPenny Stock Regulations\nIf the market price of our shares of common stock drops below $5.00 per share, our shares will be subject to the penny stock rules of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and various rules under that Act. In general terms, penny stock is defined as any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. The rules provide that any equity security is considered to be a penny stock unless that security is registered and traded on a national securities exchange meeting specified criteria set by the SEC, issued by a registered investment company, and excluded from the definition on the basis of price (at least $5.00 per share), or based on the issuers net tangible assets or revenues. In the last case, the issuers net tangible assets must exceed $3,000,000 if in continuous operation for at least three years or $5,000,000 if in operation for less than three years, or if the issuers average revenues for each of the past three years exceeds $6,000,000.\nTrading in shares of penny stock is subject to additional sales practice requirements for broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Accredited investors, in general, include individuals with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 (or $300,000 together with their spouse), and certain institutional investors. For transactions covered by these rules, broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of the security and must have received the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the first transaction, of a risk disclosure document relating to the penny stock. A broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, and current quotations for the security. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stocks. These rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to trade or maintain a market in our common stock to the extent that it is penny stock, and may affect the ability of shareholders to sell their shares.\nRule\nIn general, under Rule 144 a person, or persons whose shares are aggregated, who is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at any time during the 90 days preceding a sale and who has beneficially owned shares of our common stock for at least six months, including the holding period of any prior owner except if the prior owner was one of our affiliates, would be entitled to sell all of their shares, provided that current public information about our company is available.\nSales under Rule 144 also may be subject to manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about our Company. Any substantial sale of common stock pursuant to any resale registration statement or Rule 144 may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock by creating an excessive supply.\nBecause we were a shell company with no operations prior to the close of the Share Exchange Agreement, sales of our shares were required to be compliant with Rule 144(i). Pursuant to Rule 144(i), none of our shares of common stock could be sold under Rule 144 until December 2023, which was 12 months after we filed the current report on Form 8-K reporting the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement. Additionally, stockholders could not sell our shares pursuant to Rule 144 unless, at the time of the sale, we had filed with the SEC all periodic reports, other than reports on Form 8-K, required under the Exchange Act for the preceding 12 months.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nInformation regarding any equity securities we have sold within the past three years that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), is set forth below. Each such transaction was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act by virtue of the provisions of Regulation S (Regulation S), which was adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) under the Securities Act. Unless stated otherwise: (i) the securities were offered and sold only to non-US Persons, as defined in Regulation S.\nOn December 30, 2022, we entered into a share exchange agreement (Share Exchange Agreement) with (i) Cambell International Holding Limited (Cambell International), a limited liability company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on September 23, 2020; (ii) the shareholders of Cambell International (the Cambell Shareholders); and (iii) Ms. Xiaoyan Yuan, the holder of all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock, to acquire all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Cambell International in exchange for the issuance to the Cambell Shareholders of an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares (the Shares) of our common stock and the transfer by Ms. Yuan to the Cambell Shareholders of 9,000,000 shares of our series A preferred stock owned by her (Reverse Acquisition). The Reverse Acquisition was closed on December 30, 2022.\nIn issuing these securities to the Cambell Shareholders, we relied upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, which exempts transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering, and/or Regulation S promulgated by the SEC. Among other things, the offer or sale was made in an offshore transaction and no directed selling efforts were made in the United States by the issuer, a distributor, any of their respective affiliates, or any person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing. In addition, each of the recipients of the shares certified that he/she/it is not a U.S. Person, as defined in Regulation S, and is not acquiring the securities for the account or benefit of any U.S. Person and agreed to resell such securities only in accordance with the provisions of Regulation S, pursuant to registration under the Securities Act, or pursuant to an available exemption from registration, and agreed not to engage in hedging transactions with regard to such securities unless in compliance with the Securities Act. ITEM 6. RESERVED ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview of the Business\nWe are a U.S. holding company incorporated in Nevada on June 6, 2016, which operates through our wholly owned subsidiary, Cambell International, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on September 23, 2020. Cambell International, through a series of wholly owned subsidiaries incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, and the PRC, conducts our operations through our VIE established in the Peoples Republic of China. We do not have any equity ownership of our VIE; instead, we control and receive the economic benefits of our VIEs business operations through certain contractual arrangements, or VIE Agreements, which are used to replicate foreign investment in China-based companies where Chinese law has certain restrictions on direct foreign investment in the Chinese operating companies.\nOur China-based VIE, Liaoning Kangbaier, and its subsidiaries are focused on the research and development of extraction processes of natural \u03b2 -carotene, as well as the production, distribution marketing and sales of natural \u03b2 -carotene health food products. Natural \u03b2 -carotene is a safe source of vitamin A, which is an essential nurturant important for vision, growth, cell division, reproduction, and immunity as well as containing antioxidant properties which offer protection from diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.\nThe Chinese government is committed to improving the health and life expectancy of its population which has seen dramatic increases in the spread of diseases resulting in reduced life expectancy and premature mortality. These are the result of a number of factors including industrialization, urbanization, population aging, and changes in the ecological environment. To actively respond to these health issues, the government has adopted and implemented a number of programs to promote health awareness and improve the medical and health system. These initiatives, together with the global outbreak of COVID-19, have increased the publics awareness and demand for health products and nutritious and healthy food.\nTo address this demand and market potential, we have developed a line of natural \u03b2 -carotene health products, including natural \u03b2 -carrot juice, natural \u03b2 -carrot powder, and natural \u03b2 -carotene noodles. We are continuing to develop a variety of carotene products, such as carotene milk, carotene biscuits, carotene jelly, carotene enzyme, etc. These products are distributed, marketed, and sold in China through sales companies, regional agents, and franchised Baijiakang Healthy Lifestyle Supermarket.\nTo date, all of Liaoning Kangbaiers products are distributed through qualified dealers in the markets where it operates. Liaoning Kangbaier has a stable and well-established distribution network, which has helped it grow its sales and expand its markets. As of the date of this Annual Report, Liaoning Kangbaier has established relationships with over fifty distributors in China. Our management is constantly looking to add and build long term relationships with qualified and reputable distributors to our network.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, limitations on social or public gatherings, and the temporary closure of business venues and facilities around the world.\nBusinesses and markets in mainland China have reopened and mainland China relaxed its policies and controls relating to COVID-19 in early December 2022. As a result, the number of cases of COVID-19 increased greatly which caused restrictions on distribution of products.\nIn early May 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations Emergency Committee announced that the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (the PHEIC) should end because of declining COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths and high levels of immunity in the population. The Committee advised that it is time to transition to long-term management of the Covid-19 pandemic and the WHO Director-General concurred. We plan to continue to monitor the level of COVID-19 cases, which may still be considered a threat in the long term because the virus continues to evolve and spread.\nWe do not expect that the virus will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results at this time. However, it is not possible to predict the unanticipated consequence of the pandemic on our future business performance and liquidity. The Company continues to monitor and assess the evolving situation closely and evaluate its potential exposure.\nRecent Regulatory Developments in China\nUnder current Chinese laws and regulations, the Company believes that the VIE Agreements are not subject to any government approval. The shareholders of Baijiakang Consulting were required to register with SAFE when they established offshore vehicles to hold Liaoning Kangbaier. Such SAFE registration was effected on May 14, 2021. These shareholders of Baijiakang Consulting were also required to register their equity pledge arrangement by the Equity Pledge Agreement with Baijiakang Consulting. However, the Company faces uncertainty with respect to future actions by the PRC government that could significantly affect Baijiakang Consultings financial performance and the enforceability of the VIE Agreements.\nOn July 6, 2021, the PRC government issued the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities, calling for: (i) tightening oversight of data security, cross-border data flow, and administration of classified information, as well as amendments to relevant regulations to specify responsibilities of overseas listed Chinese companies with respect to data security and information security; (ii) enhanced oversight of overseas listed companies as well as overseas equity fundraising and listing by Chinese companies; and (iii) extraterritorial application of Chinas securities laws. As the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities were recently issued, there is great uncertainty with respect to the interpretation and implementation thereof. We will closely monitor further developments.\nIn addition, on July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China (the CAC) issued the Measures for Cybersecurity Review, or the Measures, which proposed to authorize the relevant government authorities to conduct cybersecurity review on a range of activities that affect or may affect national security, including listings in foreign countries by companies that possess the personal data of more than one million users. On January 4, 2022, the CAC issued the New Measures for Cybersecurity Review (the New Measures), which amended the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (Draft Revisions) released on July 10, 2021. As our VIE has less than one million customers, we believe that the Measures are not applicable to us in current form. The PRC government is increasingly focused on data security, recently launching cybersecurity review against a number of mobile apps operated by several US-listed Chinese companies and prohibiting these apps from registering new users during the review period. There are great uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws, rules, and regulations regarding data and privacy security. We may be required to change our data and other business practices and be subject to regulatory investigations, penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in issuer growth or engagement as a result of these laws and policies.\nCash Transfers Within our Organization\nAs between the Company and its subsidiaries, cash will generally be transferred by means of capital contributions and/or interest-free intercompany loans. Cash to be transferred or settled between the Company and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the consolidated VIE, on the other hand, will typically be transferred through payments for fees under our contractual arrangements with the VIE, expense reimbursements, or intercompany borrowings between the Company or one of its subsidiaries and the consolidated VIE. Any such loans will be interest-free, unsecured and payable on demand. For more information regarding these contractual arrangements, see Item 1. Business - Corporate History and Structure - Contractual Arrangements. The enforceability and treatment of the intercompany agreements within our organization, including intercompany borrowings and the contractual arrangements with our VIE, have not been tested in court. To the extent cash and/or assets in the business are in the PRC and/or Hong Kong or our PRC and/or Hong Kong entities, such funds and/or assets may not be available to fund operations or for other use outside of the PRC and/or Hong Kong due to interventions in or the imposition of restrictions and limitations imposed by the PRC government on the ability of the Company or its subsidiaries to transfer cash and/or assets. There are no tax consequences for intercompany borrowings or the payment for intercompany services, except for the standard value added taxes and/or income taxes for the revenues and/or profits generated from such services.\nThe proceeds of any transactions within our organization, including with the VIE, are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. For more details, please refer to the principles of consolidation set forth in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 included in this Annual Report.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, there have been no distributions or dividends by any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries to the Company. The Company has not declared any dividends or made any distributions to its shareholders, and we do not anticipate declaring a dividend in the foreseeable future. No assets other than cash are transferred within our organization. For more details, please see our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Condensed Consolidating Schedule on page 16.\nForeign Operations\nAll of our business operations are conducted in Mainland China. Accordingly, our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects are subject to a significant degree to economic, political, and legal developments in the PRC. Operating in foreign countries involves substantial risk. For example, our business activities subject us to a number of Chinese laws and regulations, such as anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and security requirements, labor laws, intellectual property laws, privacy laws, and anti-competition regulations, which have uncertainties. Any failure to comply with the PRC laws and regulations could subject us to fines and penalties, make it more difficult or impossible to do business in China, and harm our reputation.\nOperating in foreign countries also subjects us to risk from currency fluctuations. Our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales and operating expenses. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. This could either reduce the U.S. dollar value of our prices or, if we raise prices in the local currency, it could reduce the overall demand for our product offerings. Either could adversely affect our revenue. Conversely, a rise in the price of local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could adversely impact our profitability because it would increase our costs denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nRevenue Recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which replaced ASC Topic 605, using the modified retrospective method of adoption.\nThe Company recognizes revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company recognizes revenues following the five step model prescribed under ASU No. 2014-09: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation. The application of the five-step model to the revenue streams compared to the prior guidance did not result in significant changes in the way the Company records its revenue. Upon adoption, the Company evaluated its revenue recognition policy for all revenue streams within the scope of the ASU under previous standards and using the five-step model under the new guidance and confirmed that there were no differences in the pattern of revenue recognition. Hence, the Companys accounting for revenue remains substantially unchanged. There were no cumulative effect adjustments for service contracts in place prior to the adoption. The effect from the adoption of ASC Topic 606 was not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company applies judgment in determining the customers ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the customers historical payment experience.\nJudgment is used in determining: (1) whether the financing component in the sales agreement is significant and, if so, (2) the discount rate used in calculating the significant financing component. The Company assesses the significance of the financing component based on the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract that provides the customer with a significant benefit of financing. If determined to be significant, the Company adjusts the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money.\nJudgment is also used in assessing whether the long-term accounts receivable results in variable consideration and, if so, the amount to be included in the transaction price. The Company applies the portfolio approach to estimating the amount of variable consideration in these arrangements using the most likely amount method that is based on the Companys historical collection experience under similar arrangements.\nBased on the above significant judgments, the financing component, arising from the long-term accounts receivable was recognized as financing revenue over the time of payment. There was no financing revenue for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company is in traditional production business operation and its performance obligation is delivery of the products to customers within the agreed upon time and location. Customers sign on the delivery notes to indicate their acceptance. The typical payment term is either advance payment or agreed-upon credit terms after delivery of products. There is no warranty and return policy for the customers. The Company accounts for the sales of health care products using the gross method, as its controls the products that it sells until at which point it transfers control of the products to its customers and recognizes revenue.\nThere are two revenue streams within the Companys operations: (1) sales of health care products which constitutes the majority of the revenues, and (2) others.\nFiscal Years Ended June 30,\nSales Sales\nHealth care product sales $ 461,302 817,954\nOthers 1,774 11,417\nTotal revenues $ 463,076 829,371\nThere is no variable consideration and non-cash consideration agreed with the customers. The transaction price is fixed and allocated to the agreed product, the only performance obligation. The revenue is recognized at a point in time once the Company has determined that the customers have obtained control over the products. Control is typically deemed to have been transferred to the customers when the performance obligation is fulfilled, usually at the time of delivery, at the net sales price (transaction price).\nThere is no contract asset that the Company has right to consideration in exchange for the product sales that the Company has transferred to customers. Such right is not conditional on something other than the passage of time.\nPractical expedients and exemption\nThe Company elected a practical expedient that it does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the Company expects that, upon the inception of revenue contracts, the period between when the Company transfers its promised deliverables to its customers and when the customers pay for those deliverables will be more than one year.\nAdvertising and promotional expenses\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling expenses. Advertising costs amounted to $16,049 and $161,853 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nU.S. GAAP establishes a three-tier hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring the fair value of financial instruments. This hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three-tier fair value hierarchy is:\nLevel 1 - observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.\nLevel 3 - unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.\nThe carrying value of the Companys financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, and accruals and other payable approximate their fair value due to their short maturities.\nIn accordance with ASC 825, for investments in financial instruments with a variable interest rate indexed to performance of underlying assets, the Company elected the fair value method at the date of initial recognition and carried these investments at fair value. Changes in the fair value are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as other income (expense). To estimate fair value, the Company refers to the quoted rate of return provided by banks at the end of each period using the discounted cash flow method. The Company classifies the valuation techniques that use these inputs as Level 2 of fair value measurements.\nAs of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no investments in financial instruments.\nIncome tax\nThe Companys subsidiary in China are subject to the income tax laws of the relevant tax jurisdiction. No taxable income was generated outside the PRC for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. The Company accounts for income tax in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nCurrent income taxes are provided on the basis of net profit (loss) for financial reporting purposes, adjusted for income and expense items which are not assessable or deductible for income tax purposes, in accordance with the regulations of the relevant tax jurisdictions.\nDeferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements, net operating loss carry forwards and credits. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Current income taxes are provided in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates expected to apply to taxable income in which temporary differences are expected to be reversed or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the period of the enactment of the change.\nThe Company considers positive and negative evidence when determining whether a portion or all of its deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry-forward periods, its experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and its tax planning strategies. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income within the carry-forward periods provided for in the tax law and during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. When assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, the Company has considered possible sources of taxable income including (i) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, (ii) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry-forwards, (iii) future taxable income arising from implementing tax planning strategies, and (iv) specific known trend of profits expected to be reflected within the industry.\nAn uncertain tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. Penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the period incurred. PRC tax returns filed in 2023 and 2022 are subject to examination by any applicable tax authorities. The Company had no uncertain tax position for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee the discussion of the recent accounting pronouncements contained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nResults of Operations\nPursuant to the Reverse Acquisition, Cambell International is deemed to be the acquirer. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that will be reflected in the financial statements prior to the business combination will be those of Cambell International and its consolidated subsidiaries and will be recorded at the historical cost basis of Cambell International and retroactively restated. The consolidated financial statements after consummation of the business combination will include the assets and liabilities of Cambell International and its subsidiaries and VIE, historical operations of Cambell International and its subsidiaries and VIE, and operations of Bitmis Corp., now known as Campbell International Holding Corp., from the closing date of the Reverse Acquisition.\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nThe following table sets forth key components of our results of operations during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 both in dollars and as a percentage of our revenue.\nFiscal Years Ended June 30,\nAmount of Revenue Amount of Revenue\nRevenues 463,076 100.00 % 829,371 100.00 %\nCost of revenues (371,455 ) (80.21 )% (598,880 ) (72.21 )%\nGross profit 91,621 19.79 % 230,491 27.79 %\nOperating expenses\nSelling expenses (20,064 ) (4.33 )% (182,896 ) (22.05 )%\nGeneral and administrative expenses (1,184,025 ) (255.69 )% (581,376 ) (70.10 )%\nLoss from operations (1,112,468 ) (240.23 )% (533,781 ) (64.36 )%\nOther Income (expense)\nOther incomes 21,104 4.56 % 13,869 1.67 %\nOther expenses (4,914 ) (1.06 )% (144,870 ) (17.46 )%\nNet loss before taxes (1,096,278 ) (236.73 )% (664,782 ) (80.15 )%\nIncome tax expenses 0.08 % - -\nNet loss (1,095,887 ) (236.65 )% (664,782 ) (80.15 )%\nRevenues\nOur revenues were $463,076 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 representing a decrease of $366,295 or 44% from $829,371 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. There are two revenue streams within the Companys operations: (1) normal product sales of carotene which constitutes the majority of the revenues; and (2) others. The decrease was mainly due to Chinas cancellation of Covid-19 prevention and control policies, and exacerbated by the rampant spread of Covid-19 across the country during the first quarter of 2023.\nFiscal Years Ended June 30,\nSales Sales\nHealth care product sales $ 461,302 817,954\nOthers 1,774 11,417\nTotal revenues $ 463,076 829,371\nThere is no variable consideration and non-cash consideration agreed with the customers.

The revenue is recognized at a point in time once the Company has determined that the customers have obtained control over the products. Control is typically deemed to have been transferred to the customers when the performance obligation is fulfilled, usually at the time of delivery, at the net sales price (transaction price).\nThere is no contract asset that the Company has right to consideration in exchange for the product sales that the Company has transferred to customers. Such right is not conditional on something other than the passage of time.\nPractical expedients and exemption. The Company elected a practical expedient that it does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the Company expects that, upon the inception of revenue contracts, the period between when the Company transfers its promised deliverables to its customers and when the customers pay for those deliverables will be more than one year.\nCost of revenues.\nOur cost of revenues was $371,455 for the years ended June 30, 2023 compared to $598,880 for the same period last year. Cost of revenue refers to the cost of material and labor cost, direct material and overhead costs. The decrease was in line with revenue.\nGross profit and gross margin.\nOur gross profit was $91,621 for the years ended June 30, 2023, compared with a gross profit of $230,491 for the same period last year. The gross margin was increased from 27.79% during 2022 to 19.79% during 2023. The decrease was in line with revenue.\nSelling expenses.\nAs shown below, our selling expenses consist primarily of advertising fee to our selling department and other expenses incurred in connection with general operations. Our selling expenses decreased by $162,832 to $20,064 for the years ended June 30, 2023, from $182,896 for the same period 2022. The decrease was mainly due to the advertising fee decreased by $145,804 for the years ended June 30, 2023, as less promotion activities during 2023\nJune 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Fluctuation\nAmount Proportion Amount Proportion Amount Proportion\nAdvertising fee 16,049 79.99 % 161,853 88.49 % (145,804 ) (90.08 )%\nSalaries and welfare - - 19,303 10.55 % (19,303 ) (100 )%\nOthers 4,015 20.01 % 1,740 0.96 % 2,275 130.75 %\nTotal selling expenses $ 20,064 100.00 % $ 182,896 100.00 % $ (162,832 ) (89.03 )%\nGeneral and administrative expenses.\nAs shown below, our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits to our general management, finance and administrative staff, professional fees and other expenses incurred in connection with general operations. Our general and administrative expenses increased by $602,649 to $1,184,025 for the years ended June 30, 2023, from $581,376 for the same period in 2022. The increase was mainly due to $638,488 provision doubtful accounts accrued during the year ended June 30, 2023.

The Company has historically financed its operations through short-term and long-term commercial bank loans from Chinese banks, as well as its ongoing operating activities by using funds from loans from directors and shareholders, and other third party. The Company routinely monitors current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financing sources. Considering the existing working capital position and the ability to access debt funding sources, the management believes that the Companys operations and borrowing resources are sufficient to provide for its current and foreseeable capital requirements to support its ongoing operations for the next twelve months.\nThe following table set forth a summary of its cash flows for the periods indicated:\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended\nJune 30,\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (9,570,964 ) 9,482,639\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (1,175 ) (96,166 )\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 9,674,141 (9,238,562 )\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $9,570,964 for the years ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $9,482,639 net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended June 30, 2022.\nThe net cash used in operating activities for the years ended June 30, 2023 was mainly due to our net loss of $1,095,887, a decrease in advance from customers of $6,062,321 and a decrease in other payables of $4,150,362, partially offset by a decrease in other receivables of $1,224,585. The net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended June 30, 2022 was mainly due to our net loss of $664,782, an increase in other receivable of $1,519,632, and partially offset by an increase in other payables of $4,487,644, an increase in advance from customers of $6,920,217.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1,175 for the years ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $96,166 net cash used in investing activities for the years ended June 30, 2022. The net cash used in investing activities was mainly attributable to purchase of property and equipment for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $9,674,141 for the years ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $9,238,562 net cash used in financing activities for the years ended June 30, 2022. The net cash provided by financing activities was mainly attributable to advances from related parties for the years ended June 30, 2023. The net cash used in financing activities was mainly attributable to repayment to related parties for the years ended June 30, 2022.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company had no short-term and long-term bank loans as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022.\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.\nJOBS Act\nOn April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, eases certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.\nGoing Concern Consideration\nThe financial statements included in this Annual Report have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The going-concern basis assumes that assets are realized and liabilities are extinguished in the ordinary course of business at amounts disclosed on the financial statements. The Companys ability to continue as a going concern depends on the liquidation of its current assets. As of June 30, 2023, the Company experienced cash outflows from operating activities of $9,570,964, the Company incurred a net loss of $1,095,887, and the Company had negative working capital of $3,064,961. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.\nIn order to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months, the Company continues to focus on increasing its revenue through the sale of health care products and its other products, streamlining its overhead costs, or obtaining financing from its stockholders or directors. However, the Company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to increase revenue, that it will be able to successfully implement its business plan, or that financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The directors will continue to support the group by providing adequate financial assistance to enable the group to continue its business operations for the foreseeable future.\nFuture Financings\nWe will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our operations and other activities, or if we are able, there is no guarantee that existing shareholders will not be substantially diluted.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. Dollar. Our entity in the British Virgin Islands uses the U.S. dollar. Our entities in the PRC use the local currencies, Renminbi (RMB) as their functional currencies as determined based on the criteria of ASC 830, Foreign Currency Translation. Assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate as quoted by www.xe.com at the end of the period. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average translation rates and the equity accounts are translated at historical rates.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nOur consolidated financial statements are included on pages through, which appear at the end of this Annual Report. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nOn July 8, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company, then known as Bitmis Corp., received a resignation letter from Zhong Xiong Chen as a member of the Board of Directors. Further, on July 8, 2020, the Board of Directors received another resignation from Li When Chen as a member of the Board of Directors and chief financial officer/treasurer of the Company. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic in the Peoples Republic of China where the Companys business operations and principal place of business were located, the Company was unable to continue its operations and became a dormant company until April 22, 2022.\nOn April 12, 2022, the Eighth Judicial District Court in Clark County, Nevada Case No: A-22-849683-B appointed Custodian Ventures LLC (Custodian Ventures), managed by David Lazar, as the Companys custodian. Upon the appointment of Mr. Lazar as the sole officer, chief executive officer/president, chief financial officer/treasurer and secretary, and as the sole director, all former officers and directors of the Company had either previously resigned or resigned effective with his appointments.\nThrough Mr. Lazars manager position in Custodian Ventures in its capacity as custodian for the Company, including Mr. Lazars appointment as the sole officer and director, on July 19, 2022, Mr. Lazar filed the Companys annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, together with an auditors report and consent from BF Borgers CPA, PC (BF Borgers).\nOn December 5, 2022, a current report on Form 8-K was filed announcing that on September 22, 2022, as a result of a private transaction (the 2022 Transaction), 10,000,000 shares of series A preferred stock of the Company were transferred from Custodian Ventures to Xiaoyan Yuan. As a result, Xiaoyan Yuan became the holder of 90% of the voting rights of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company. The current report on Form 8-K further disclosed that simultaneously David Lazar resigned effective immediately as the sole officer and director and Xiaoyan Yuan was appointed as the new chief executive officer/president, chief financial officer/treasurer and secretary, and sole director of the Company.\nOn December 30, 2022, a current report on Form 8-K was filed announcing that on December 30, 2022, Cambell International Holding Limited, a corporation organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (Cambell International), entered into a share exchange agreement with the Company, the shareholders of Cambell International, and Xiaoyan Yuan to acquire all the issued and outstanding capital of Cambell International in exchange for the issuance by the Company of an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of its common stock to certain shareholders (Reverse Acquisition). As a condition of closing of the Reverse Acquisition, Xiaoyan Yuan transferred to the shareholders of Cambell International an aggregate 9,000,000 shares of the Companys series A preferred stock held of record by Xiaoyan Yuan. After the Reverse Acquisition, Cambell International became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company on December 30, 2022.\nThe December 30, 2022 current report on Form 8-K contained the auditors opinion and consent from WWC, PC (WWC) as Campbell Internationals auditor. Subsequently, WWC was engaged as the Companys independent auditor and performed review procedures for the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023.\nEffective as of January 30, 2023, BF Borgers tendered its resignation as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm. BF Borgers audit report on the Companys financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that the audit report on the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, contained an uncertainty about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nThere was no 8-K filed to reflect the resignation of BF Borgers effective as of January 30, 2023, or the appointment of WWC as the Companys independent auditor effective as of January 30, 2023.\nFrom BF Borgers appointment as the Companys independent auditor until the effective date of its resignation on January 30, 2023, there were: (i) no disagreements between the Company and BF Borgers on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of BF Borgers, would have caused BF Borgers to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in its report on the financial statements for such year; and (ii) no reportable events as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.\nThe Company provided BF Borgers with a copy of the disclosures it made in the Current Report on Form 8-K (the Report) regarding its change of certifying accountants prior to the time the Report was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). The Company requested that BF Borgers furnish a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether or not it agrees with the statements made herein. A copy of BF Borgers letter dated August 8, 2023 was attached as Exhibit 16.1.\nEffective as of January 30, 2023, the Board engaged WWC as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm. The Board also engaged WWC to act as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, and in the subsequent period through June 30, 2023, neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf has consulted with WWC regarding: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered with respect to the Companys financial statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice provided to the Company by WWC that was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was the subject of a disagreement or reportable event as those terms are defined in Item 304(a)(1) of Regulation S-K. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15I under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Based on his evaluation as of the end of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer and principal accounting manager, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in insuring that the information relating to our Company required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as a result of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting due to the existence of the following material weaknesses:\n\u25cf A lack of sufficient and adequately trained internal accounting and finance personnel with appropriate understanding of U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements;\n\u25cf A lack of segregation of duties within significant accounts; and\n\u25cf A lack of a functioning audit committee and a majority of outside directors on the Companys Board of Directors.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nAs of June 30, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in the 2013 updated Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that are considered to be material weaknesses as described herein above. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nNotwithstanding the existence of these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our management believes that the financial statements included in its reports fairly present in all material respects the Companys financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. We continue to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls and procedures on an on-going basis. Once our cash position improves, we plan to hire an experienced controller and work to build an internal accounting team with sufficient in-house expertise in US GAAP reporting. However, due to our current limited cash flow, we cannot assure you when we will be able to implement those remediation methods.\nBecause we are an emerging growth company, this Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.\nChanges in internal controls over financial reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth fiscal quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, covered by this report that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting other than the facts disclosed above.

This significant responsibility requires highly-skilled individuals with various qualities, attributes and professional experience. Our director believes that there are general requirements for service on the Board that are applicable to directors and that there are other skills and experience that should be represented on the Board as a whole but not necessarily by each director. The Board considers the qualifications of director and director candidates individually and in the broader context of the Boards overall composition and the Companys current and future needs.\nQualifications for All Directors\nIn its assessment of each potential candidate, including those recommended by the stockholders, the Board will consider the nominees judgment, integrity, experience, independence, understanding of the Companys business or other related industries and such other factors it determines are pertinent in light of the current needs of the Board. The Board also takes into account the ability of a director to devote the time and effort necessary to fulfill his or her responsibilities to the Company.\nThe Board requires that each director be a recognized person of high integrity with a proven record of success in his or her field. Each director must demonstrate innovative thinking, familiarity with and respect for corporate governance requirements and practices, an appreciation of multiple cultures and a commitment to sustainability and to dealing responsibly with social issues. The Board believes that it should include some directors with a high level of financial literacy and some directors who possess relevant business experience as a chief executive officer, president or similar position at a company. In addition to the qualifications required of all directors, the Board conducts interviews of potential director candidates to assess intangible qualities including the individuals ability to ask difficult questions and, simultaneously, to work collegially.\nBoard Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight\nThe Board of Directors intends to exercise its oversight in the following manner:\n- appointing, retaining, and overseeing the work of the independent auditors, including resolving disagreements between the management and the independent auditors relating to financial reporting;\n- approving all auditing and non-auditing services permitted to be performed by the independent auditors;\n- reviewing annually the independence and quality control procedures of the independent auditors;\n- reviewing and approving all proposed related party transactions;\n- discussing the annual audited financial statements with the management; and\n- meeting separately with the independent auditors to discuss critical accounting policies, management letters, recommendations on internal controls, the auditors engagement letter and independence letter and other material written communications between the independent auditors and the management.\nBoard Committees\nAudit Committee\nWe intend to establish an audit committee of the Board which will consist of soon-to-be-nominated independent directors. The audit committees duties will be to recommend to the Board the engagement of independent auditors to audit our financial statements and to review our accounting and auditing principles. The audit committee will review the scope, timing and fees for the annual audit and the results of audit examinations performed by the internal auditors and independent public accountants, including their recommendations to improve the system of accounting and internal controls. The audit committee will at all times be composed exclusively of directors who are, in the opinion of the Board, free from any relationship which would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment as a committee member and who possess an understanding of financial statements and generally accepted accounting principles.\nAudit Committee Financial Expert.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nConsideration of the Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had incurred significant working capital deficiency and accumulated deficit at June 30, 2023, net loss from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2023. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regards to these matters are also described in Note 2. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. If the Company is unable to successfully obtain the necessary additional financial support as specified in Note 2, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on our consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there were no critical audit matters.\n/s/ WWC, P.C.\nWWC, P.C.\nCertified Public Accountants\nPCAOB ID: 1171\nWe have served as auditor since 2022.\nSan Mateo, California\nOctober 19, 2023\nCAMBELL INTERNATIONAL HOLDING CORP.\n(FORMELY BITMIS HOLDING CORP.)\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAS OF JUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022\n(Expressed in U.S. dollar, except for the number of shares)\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS\nCash $ 286,272 $ 204,004\nAccounts receivable, net of $58,021 and $62,804 allowance for doubtful accounts as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively 25,444 -\nPrepayments 107,613 105,216\nOther receivables 36,740 1,310,866\nAmounts due from related parties 19,219 7,567,786\nInventory 369,327 305,046\nTotal current assets 844,615 9,492,918\nNON-CURRENT ASSETS\nOther receivable - long term, net -\n615,987\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 48,806 87,590\nTotal non-current assets 48,806 703,577\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 893,421 $ 10,196,495\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES\nAccounts payable $ 16,541 $ 82,365\nAdvance from customers 347,429 6,668,713\nAmounts due to related parties 3,421,327 1,208,644\nPayroll payable 16,212 22,447\nTax payable 44,416 11,400\nOther payables 63,651 4,376,943\nTotal current liabilities 3,909,576 12,370,512\nTOTAL LIABILITIES 3,909,576 12,370,512\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nSHAREHOLDERS DEFICIT\nPreferred shares, par value $0.001, 10,000,000 shares authorized, 10,000,000 and 0 shares issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively 10,000 -\nCommon shares, par value $0.001;

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP).\nPrinciple of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, and the VIE. All inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated upon consolidation.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business are dependent on, among other things, the Companys ability to operate profitably, to generate cash flows from operations, and to pursue financing arrangements to support its working capital requirements.\nIn assessing the Companys liquidity, the Company monitors and analyzes its cash and cash equivalents and its operating and capital expenditure commitments. The Companys liquidity needs are to meet its working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. As of June 30, 2023, the Companys current liabilities exceeded the current assets by $3,064,961, its accumulated deficit was $3,296,036 and the Company has incurred losses during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of our business plan, and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nIn evaluating if there is substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern, the Company are trying to alleviate the going concern risk through (1) increasing cash generated from operations by controlling operating expenses, (2) financing from domestic banks and other financial institutions, and (3) equity or debt financing. The Company has certain plans to mitigate these adverse conditions and to increase the liquidity.\nOn an on-going basis, the Company will also receive financial support commitments from the Companys related parties.\nThese conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nLiquidity\nThe Company had a working deficit of $3,064,961 as of June 30, 2023, a decrease of $187,367 from a working deficit of $2,877,594 as of June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Companys cash was $286,272 and $204,004, respectively.\nThe Companys primary need for liquidity stems from its need to fund working capital requirements of the Companys businesses, its capital expenditures and its general operations, including debt repayment. The Company has historically financed its operations through loans from directors and shareholders, and other third party. The Company routinely monitors current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financing sources. In addition, the existing major shareholder committed not to request for repayment of the amount due to shareholders by June 30, 2023. Considering the existing working capital position and the ability to access debt funding sources, the management believes that the Companys operations and borrowing resources are sufficient to provide for its current and foreseeable capital requirements to support its ongoing operations for the next twelve months.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management of the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets including application of discount on long-term other receivables with present value, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Identified below are the accounting policies that reflect the Companys most significant estimates and judgments, and those that the Company believes are the most critical to fully understanding and evaluating its consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2020 the World Health Organization declared coronavirus COVID-19 a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, workforces, customers, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The pandemic may impact Companys future estimates including, but not limited to, our allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuations, fair value measurements, asset impairment charges. It is not possible for the Company to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak and its effects on its business or results of operations at this time.\nIn early May 2023, the World Health Organization International Health Regulations Emergency Committee announced that the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (the Committee) should end because of declining Covid-19 related hospitalizations and deaths and high levels of immunity in the population. The Committee advised that it is time to transition to long-term management of the Covid-19 pandemic and the WHO Director-General concurred. The Company plans to continue to monitor the level of Covid-19 cases, which may still be considered a threat in the long term because the virus continues to evolve and spread.\nVIE Consolidation\nFor the consolidated VIEs, management made evaluations of the relationships between the Company and the VIEs and the economic benefit flow of contractual arrangements with the VIEs. In connection with such evaluation, management also took into account the fact that, as a result of such contractual arrangements, the Company controls the shareholders voting interests in these VIEs. As a result of such evaluation, management concluded that the Company is the primary beneficiary of its consolidated VIEs.\nPRC laws and regulations prohibit or restrict foreign ownership of companies that operate Internet information and content, Internet access, online games, mobile, value added telecommunications and certain other businesses in which the Company is engaged or could be deemed to be engaged. Consequently, the Company conducts certain of its operations and businesses in the PRC through its VIEs. The Company consolidates in its consolidated financial statements all of the VIEs of which the Company is the primary beneficiary.\nThe following financial information of the Companys consolidated VIEs (including subsidiary of VIEs) is included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements:\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS\nCash $ 286,272 $ 204,004\nAccounts receivable, net of $58,021 and $62,804 allowance for doubtful accounts as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively 25,444 -\nPrepayments 107,613 105,216\nOther receivables 36,740 1,310,866\nAmounts due from related parties 19,219 7,567,786\nInventory 369,327 305,046\nTotal current assets 844,615 9,492,918\nNON-CURRENT ASSETS\nOther receivable - long term, net -\n615,987\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 48,806 87,590\nTotal non-current assets 48,806 703,577\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 893,421 $ 10,196,495\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES\nAccounts payable $ 16,541 $ 82,365\nAdvance from customers 347,429 6,668,713\nAmounts due to related parties 3,421,327 1,208,644\nPayroll payable 16,212 22,447\nTax payable 44,416 11,400\nOther payables 63,651 4,376,943\nTotal current liabilities 3,909,576 12,370,512\nTOTAL LIABILITIES 3,909,576 12,370,512\nFor the\nFiscal Years\nEnded\nJune 30,\nGross profit $ 91,621 230,491\nNet loss $ (1,095,887 ) (664,782 )\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nU.S. GAAP establishes a three-tier hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring the fair value of financial instruments. This hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three-tier fair value hierarchy is:\nLevel 1 - observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the market place.\nLevel 3 - unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.\nThe carrying value of the Companys financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, and accruals and other payable approximate their fair value due to their short maturities.\nIn accordance with ASC 825, for investments in financial instruments with a variable interest rate indexed to performance of underlying assets, the Company elected the fair value method at the date of initial recognition and carried these investments at fair value. Changes in the fair value are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as other income (expense). To estimate fair value, the Company refers to the quoted rate of return provided by banks at the end of each period using the discounted cash flow method. The Company classifies the valuation techniques that use these inputs as Level 2 of fair value measurements.\nAs of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no investments in financial instruments.\nCash\nCash consists of cash on hand and at banks and highly liquid investments, which are unrestricted from withdrawal or use, and which have original maturities of three months or less when purchased.\nCash denominated in RMB with a U.S. dollar equivalent of $286,272 and $204,004 as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were held in accounts at financial institutions located in the PRC\u201a which is not freely convertible into foreign currencies. In addition, these balances are not covered by insurance. While management believes that these financial institutions are of high credit quality, it also continually monitors their credit worthiness. The Company, its subsidiaries and VIE have not experienced any losses in such accounts and do not believe the cash is exposed to any significant risk.\nAccounts Receivable, Net and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable represents the revenue earned from the customers not yet collected. The carrying value of accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance that reflects the Companys best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. Account balances are charged off against the provision after all means of collection have been exhausted and the likelihood of collection is not probable. For the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2016- 13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement on Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, including certain subsequent amendments, transitional guidance and other interpretive guidance within ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05, ASU 2019-11, ASU 2020-02 and ASU 2020-03 (collectively, including ASU 2016-13, ASC 326). ASC 326 introduces an approach based on expected losses to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts, which replaces the previous incurred loss impairment model. The Companys estimation of allowance for doubtful accounts considers factors such as historical credit loss experience, age of receivable balances, current market conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, as well as an assessment of receivables due from specific identifiable counterparties to determine whether these receivables are considered at risk or uncollectible. The Company assesses collectibility by pooling receivables that have similar risk characteristics and evaluates receivables individually when specific receivables no longer share those risk characteristics. For receivables evaluated individually, when it is determined that foreclosure is probable or when the debtor is experiencing financial difficulty at the reporting date and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of collateral, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. The balance of allowance of June 30, 2023 and 2022 were $58,021 and $62,804, respectively.\nInventory\nInventory primarily consists of 1) raw materials, primarily ingredients such as carrots, 2) finished goods, primarily \u03b2-carotene series products including carrot juice, carrot meal and carrot noodle, and 3) miscellaneous such as packages.\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (market value). The cost of raw materials is determined on the basis of weighted average. The cost of finished goods is determined on the basis of weighted average and comprises direct materials, direct labor and an appropriate proportion of overhead.\nNet realizable value is based on estimated selling prices less selling expenses and any further costs expected to be incurred for completion. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence, or impaired balances.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment, net is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nUseful\nLives\nCategories\n(Years)\nFurniture and equipment\nMachinery\nMotor vehicles\nExpenditure for maintenance and repairs is expended as incurred.\nThe gain or loss on the disposal of equipment is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell the relevant assets and is recognized in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 360-10-35, the Company reviews the carrying values of long-lived assets, including property and equipment with finite lives and intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant adverse change to market conditions that will impact the future use of the assets) indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate and recognize an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset. If an impairment is identified, the Company would reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flows approach or, when available and appropriate, to comparable market values. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant management judgment based on the Companys historical results and anticipated results and is subject to many factors. The discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in the Companys business model is determined by its management. An impairment loss would be recorded if the Company determined that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. The impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying values of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets. Impairment of $2,652 and $2,871 has been recorded by the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nRevenue Recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which replaced ASC Topic 605, using the modified retrospective method of adoption.\nThe Company recognizes revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company recognizes revenues following the five-step model prescribed under ASU No. 2014-09: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation. The application of the five-step model to the revenue streams compared to the prior guidance did not result in significant changes in the way the Company records its revenue. Upon adoption, the Company evaluated its revenue recognition policy for all revenue streams within the scope of the ASU under previous standards and using the five-step model under the new guidance and confirmed that there were no differences in the pattern of revenue recognition. Hence, the Companys accounting for revenue remains substantially unchanged. There were no cumulative effect adjustments for service contracts in place prior to the adoption. The effect from the adoption of ASC Topic 606 was not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company applies judgment in determining the customers ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the customers historical payment experience.\nJudgment is used in determining: (1) whether the financing component in the sales agreement is significant and, if so, (2) the discount rate used in calculating the significant financing component. The Company assesses the significance of the financing component based on the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract that provides the customer with a significant benefit of financing. If determined to be significant, the Company adjusts the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money.\nJudgment is also used in assessing whether the long-term accounts receivable results in variable consideration and, if so, the amount to be included in the transaction price. The Company applies the portfolio approach to estimating the amount of variable consideration in these arrangements using the most likely amount method that is based on the Companys historical collection experience under similar arrangements.\nBased on the above significant judgments, the financing component, arising from the long-term accounts receivable was recognized as financing revenue over the time of payment. There was no financing revenue for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company is in traditional production business operation and its performance obligation is delivery of the products to customers with agreed time and location. Customers sign on the delivery note as acceptance. The typical payment term is either advance payment or agreed-upon credit term after delivery of products. There is no warranty and return policy for the customers.\nThere are two revenue streams within the Companys operations: (1) sales of health products which constitutes the majority of the revenues, and (2) others.\nFor the Years Ended\nSales Sales\nHealth product sales $ 461,302 $ 817,954\nOthers 1,774 11,417\nTotal revenues $ 463,076 829,371\nThere is no variable consideration and non-cash consideration agreed with the customers. The transaction price is fixed and allocated to the agreed product, the only performance obligation. The revenue is recognized at a point in time once the Company has determined that the customers have obtained control over the products. Control is typically deemed to have been transferred to the customers when the performance obligation is fulfilled, usually at the time of delivery, at the net sales price (transaction price).\nThere is no contract asset that the Company has right to consideration in exchange for the product sales that the Company has transferred to customers. Such right is not conditional on something other than the passage of time.\nThe standard warranty included in the price of the products is an assurance-type warranty for a period not to exceed one year from the point when the customers have obtained control over the products, and the nature of tasks under the warranty only remedying defective product. It is not considered as a distinct performance obligation.\nPractical expedients and exemption\nThe Company elected a practical expedient that it does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the Company expects that, upon the inception of revenue contracts, the period between when the Company transfers its promised deliverables to its customers and when the customers pay for those deliverables will be more than one year.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling expenses. Advertising costs amounted to $16,049 and $161,853 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIncome Tax\nThe Companys subsidiaries in China were subject to the income tax laws of the relevant tax jurisdiction. No taxable income was generated outside the PRC for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. The Company accounts for income tax in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nCurrent income taxes are provided on the basis of net profit (loss) for financial reporting purposes, adjusted for income and expense items which are not assessable or deductible for income tax purposes, in accordance with the regulations of the relevant tax jurisdictions.\nDeferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements, net operating loss carry forwards and credits. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Current income taxes are provided in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates expected to apply to taxable income in which temporary differences are expected to be reversed or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the period of the enactment of the change.\nThe Company considers positive and negative evidence when determining whether a portion or all of its deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry-forward periods, its experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and its tax planning strategies. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income within the carry-forward periods provided for in the tax law and during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. When assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, the Company has considered possible sources of taxable income including (i) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, (ii) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry-forwards, (iii) future taxable income arising from implementing tax planning strategies, and (iv) specific known trend of profits expected to be reflected within the industry.\nAn uncertain tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. Penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the period incurred. PRC tax returns filed in 2023 and 2022 are subject to examination by any applicable tax authorities. The Company had no uncertain tax position for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nValue Added Tax\nThe Company was subject to VAT at the rate of 13% and related surcharges on revenue generated from selling products for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. Entities that are VAT general taxpayers are allowed to offset qualified input VAT paid to suppliers against their output VAT liabilities.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Company has adopted ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, (EPS) which requires presentation of basic EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation. In the accompanying consolidation financial statements, basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.\nDiluted EPS includes the effect from potential issuance of ordinary shares. There was no potentially dilutive share to be issued during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nRelated Parties\nThe Company adopted ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures, for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.\nForeign Currency and Foreign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of the Company is the Chinese Yuan (RMB), as their functional currencies. An entitys functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates, normally that is the currency of the environment in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. Managements judgment is essential to determine the functional currency by assessing various indicators, such as cash flows, sales price and market, expenses, financing and inter-company transactions and arrangements.\nForeign currency transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are re-measured at the applicable rates of exchange in effect at that date. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency re-measurement are included in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average of the exchange rates in effect during the reporting period. Shareholders equity accounts are translated using the historical exchange rates at the date the entry to shareholders equity was recorded, except for the change in retained earnings during the period, which is translated using the historical exchange rates used to translate each periods income statement. Differences resulting from translating functional currencies to the reporting currency are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets.\nTranslation of amounts from RMB into U.S. dollars has been made at the following exchange rates:\nBalance sheet items, except for equity accounts\nJune 30, 2023 RMB7.2513 to $1\nJune 30, 2022 RMB6.6991 to $1\nIncome statement and cash flows items\nFor the years ended June30, 2023 RMB6.9536 to $1\nFor the years ended June 30, 2022 RMB6.4556 to $1\nSegment reporting\nThe Companys management reviews the consolidated results when making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of the Company as a whole and hence, the Company has only one reportable segment. The Company does not distinguish between markets or segments for the purpose of internal reporting. The Companys long-lived assets are substantially all located in the PRC and substantially all of the Companys revenues are derived from within the PRC. Therefore, no geographical segments are presented.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is subject to contingencies, including legal proceedings and claims arising out of the business that relate to a wide range of matters, such as government investigations and tax matters. The Company recognizes a liability for such contingency if it determines it is probable that a loss has occurred, and a reasonable estimate of the loss can be made. The Company may consider many factors in making these assessments including historical and the specific facts and circumstances of each matter.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company is an emerging growth company (EGC) as defined by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act). The JOBS Act provides that an EGC can take advantage of extended transition periods for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an EGC to delay adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company elected to take advantage of the extended transition periods. However, this election will not apply should the Company cease to be classified as an EGC.\nIn June 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): The amendments in this Update require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The amendments broaden the information that an entity must consider in developing its expected credit loss estimate for assets measured either collectively or individually. The use of forecasted information incorporates more timely information in the estimate of expected credit loss, which will be more decision useful to users of the financial statements. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10 which defers the effective dates for the credit losses, derivatives and lease standards for certain companies. The deferred effective date for credit losses is January 1, 2023 for calendar-year end companies which are smaller reporting companies, non-SEC filers and all other companies including not-for-profit companies and employee benefit plans. The deferral for the derivatives and lease standards is only applicable to the companies which are not public business entities. The Company is still evaluating the impact of the accounting standard of credit losses on the Companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nOn December 18, 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This guidance amends ASC Topic 740 and addresses several aspects including 1) evaluation of step-up tax basis of goodwill when there is not a business combination, 2) policy election to not allocate consolidated taxes on a separate entity basis to entities not subject to income tax, 3) accounting for tax law changes or rates during interim periods, 4) ownership changes from equity method investment to subsidiary or vice versa, 5) elimination of exception to intraperiod allocation when there is gain in discontinued operations and a loss from continuing operations, 6) treatment of franchise taxes that are partially based on income. The guidance is effective for calendar year-end public entities on January 1, 2021 and other entities on January 1, 2022. The Company adopted this guidance on July 1, 2021 and determined that the adoption of this guidance does not have material impacts on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-10, Codification Improvements. The amendments in this Update represent changes to clarify the Codification or correct unintended application of guidance that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities. The amendments in this Update affect a wide variety of Topics in the Codification and apply to all reporting entities within the scope of the affected accounting guidance. ASU 2020-10 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The amendments in this Update should be applied retrospectively. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company does not believe other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Companys consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of cash flows.\n3.
