The Purchase price of $250,000 for the Preferred Stock was paid in cash and was provided from the individual private funds of Purchaser.\nThe Preferred Stock acquired by the Purchaser consisted of:\n1. 50,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock wherein each share is entitled to fifteen (15) votes and converts into ten (10) shares of the Companys common stock.\n2. 5,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock wherein each share is entitled to one thousand (1,000) votes and converts into one thousand (1,000) shares of the Companys common stock.\n3. 10,000 shares of Series C Non-Convertible Preferred Stock wherein each share is entitled to one thousand (1,000) votes and is non-convertible into shares of the Companys common stock.\nAcquisition of Assets of Nature\nOn August 14, 2020 (the Closing Date), TNRG and the members of Nature entered into an Interest Purchase Agreement (the Interest Purchase Agreement), which closed on the same date.

We plan to use our resources to capitalize on the demand to further create and scale U.S. hemp-derived consumer products and brands. We do not engage in any commercial activities related to the cultivation, distribution or possession of U.S. Schedule I cannabis in the United States The rate of the Companys expansion of distribution remains subject to factors that are beyond the Companys control, including evolving regulations, the development of sufficient supply chain and manufacturing infrastructure and development of distribution and retail channels across the United States.\nSupply Chain\nIn producing our supplement products, we source our ingredients from our suppliers on an ongoing as-needed basis. We have not entered into any contracts that obligate us to purchase a minimum quantity or exclusively from any food service distributor. Our supplements are manufactured at our facilities in Hollywood, Florida following to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).\nWe rely on a variety of suppliers. Should the relationship with an industry vendor be interrupted or discontinued, it is believed that alternate component suppliers could be identified to support the continued advancement of the Company.\nBranding Strategy\nBranding plays a critical role in our success.\nWe have performed marketing and capabilities landscape assessments based upon consumer immersion and research and designed to understand consumer purchase behaviors and values, assess short and long term socio-cultural and market trends, and analyze the marketplace and competitive landscape.\nWe have developed comprehensive, consumer-oriented toolkit using consistent language and tone for printed and online media and to target retailers on a sell-in, exclusive basis.\nWe develop advertisements for print and online media, and sales materials for retail strategic partners.

This allows us to provide integrated solutions to our customers, as well as sell additional goods and services to customers of a single segment. There is no aspect of our business, however, that is protected by patents or copyrights. As a result, our competitors could duplicate our business model with little effort.\nThe industry in which we compete is highly competitive. We believe that the most important competitive factors in our industry include the ability to control as much as possible of the supply chain.\nWe believe that our competitors have certain existing advantages such as history and heritage; strong ecommerce and mobile presence; wholesale and flagship retail presence; strong social presence; a wide range of ancillary product offerings; strong public relations and marketing efforts; a balanced range of price points across the board; and consumer trust and recognition. However, we set ourselves apart with strong brand identity and visuals, unique design and quality and brand awareness through traditional and social media.\nBecause we are a small company with a limited operating history, we are at a competitive disadvantage against larger and well-capitalized companies which have a track record of success and operations. Therefore, our primary method of competition involves promoting our direct to consumer offering.\nPatents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements Or Labor Contracts, Including Duration\nNone.\nEffect Of Existing Or Probable Governmental Regulations On The Business\nThe Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, Public Law 115-334 (the AIA), was signed into law on December 20, 2018. It provided a new statutory definition of hemp and amended the definition of marihuana under 21 U.S.C. 802(16) and the listing of tetrahydrocannabinols under 21 U.S.C. 812(c). The AIA thereby amends the regulatory controls over marihuana, tetrahydrocannabinols, and other marihuana-related constituents in the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).\nThis rulemaking makes four conforming changes to the Drug Enforcement Administrations (DEA) existing regulations:\n1. It modifies 21 CFR 1308.11(d)(31) by adding language stating that the definition of Tetrahydrocannabinols does not include any material, compound, mixture, or preparation that falls within the definition of hemp set forth in 7 U.S.C. 1639 o.\n2. It removes from control in schedule V under 21 CFR 1308.15(f) a drug product in finished dosage formulation that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that contains cannabidiol (2-[1R-3-methyl-6R-(1-methylethenyl)-2- cyclohexen-1-yl]-5-pentyl-1,3- benzenediol) derived from cannabis and no more than 0.1% (w/w) residual tetrahydrocannabinols.\n3. It also removes the import and export controls described in 21 CFR 1312.30(b) over those same substances.\n4. It modifies 21 CFR 1308.11(d)(58) by stating that the definition of Marihuana Extract is limited to extracts containing greater than 0.3 percent delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol on a dry weight basis. This interim final rule merely conforms DEA's regulations to the statutory amendments to the CSA that have already taken effect, and it does not add additional requirements to the regulations.\nThe DEAs interim rule also includes changes how it implements the CSA:\nChanges to the Definition of Tetrahydrocannabinols:\nThe AIA also modified the listing for tetrahydrocannabinols under 21 U.S.C. 812(c) by stating that the term tetrahydrocannabinols does not include tetrahydrocannabinols in hemp. Specifically, 21 U.S.C. 812(c) Schedule I now lists as schedule I controlled substances: \u2018\u2018Tetrahydrocannabinols, except for tetrahydrocannabinols in hemp (as defined under section 1639o of Title 7). Therefore, the AIA limits the control of tetrahydrocannabinols (for Controlled Substance Code Number 7370). For tetrahydrocannabinols that are naturally occurring constituents of the plant material, Cannabis sativa L., any material that contains 0.3% or less of D9-THC by dry weight is not controlled, unless specifically controlled elsewhere under the CSA. Conversely, for tetrahydrocannabinols that are naturally occurring constituents of Cannabis sativa L., any such material that contains greater than 0.3% of D9-THC by dry weight remains a controlled substance in schedule I. The AIA does not impact the control status of synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols (for Controlled Substance Code Number 7370) because the statutory definition of \u2018\u2018hemp is limited to materials that are derived from the plant Cannabis sativa L. For synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols, the concentration of D9- THC is not a determining factor in whether the material is a controlled substance. All synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols remain schedule I controlled substances. This rulemaking is modifying 21 CFR 1308.11(d) to reflect this statutory change. By this rulemaking, 21 CFR 1308.11(d)(31) is being modified via the addition of subsection (11) which reads: Tetrahydrocannabinols does not include any material, compound, mixture, or preparation that falls within the definition of hemp set forth in 7 U.S.C. 1639o.\nStated simply, the above language from the DEA provides that any cannabis or cannabis derivative containing more than 0.3% \u2206-9 THC fails to meet the AIA definition of hemp and therefore remains a controlled substance under the CSA. In other words, this proposed rule directly conflicts with the AIAs definition of hemp which defines hemp as the plant Cannabis sativa L and any part of that plant including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delat-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than .3 percent on a dry weight basis. 7 U.S.C definition \u00a7 1639o, subsection 1. Further, Congress expressly exempted hemp derivatives and hemp extracts from the federal Controlled Substances Act, as well as hemp itself: (A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the term marihuana means all parts of the plant Cannabis sativa L., whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of such plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such plant, its seeds or resin. (B) The term \"marihuana\" does not include- (i) hemp, as defined in section 1639o of title 7; or (ii) the mature stalks of such plant, fiber produced from such stalks, oil or cake made from the seeds of such plant, any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such stalks (except the resin extracted therefrom), fiber, oil, or cake, or the sterilized seed of such plant which is incapable of germination. See 21 U.S.C. 802, subdivision (16). Further, Congress also expressly exempted the AIAs definition of hemp, hemp derivatives, and hemp extracts from the Controlled Substances Act list of Schedule 1 drugs providing: (c) Unless specifically excepted or unless listed in another schedule, any material, compound, mixture, or preparation, which contains any quantity of the following hallucinogenic substances, or which contains any of their salts, isomers, and salts of isomers whenever the existence of such salts, isomers, and salts of isomers is possible within the specific chemical designation: (17) Tetrahydrocannabinols, except for tetrahydrocannabinols in hemp (as defined under section 297A of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 [7 USCS \u00a7 1639o]). See 21 U.S.C. 812, subdivision (C), subpart (17).\nGiven that Congress explicitly defined hemp to include hemp derivatives and hemp extracts, as long as delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (delta- 8 THC) is extracted or derived from hemp or is extracted or derived from extract or derivative of hemp, it cannot be criminalized under the federal Controlled Substances Act, until Congress either further amends the AIA of 2018 or amends the existing CSA. There is case law precedent to support the proposition that a government agency, in this case the DEA, cannot make a rule that directly conflicts an existing federal statute. In determining whether to give deference to an agency rule with a federal statute, Courts apply the Chevron Doctrine set forth by the Supreme Court in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council. See 467 U.S. 837, 842-4 (1984).\nCourts must employ a two-step analysis under the Chevron Doctrine. First, if the statute speaks clearly to the precise question at issue,\" the Court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43. Second, where the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the Court must sustain the agency determination if it is based on a permissible construction of the statute. Id. at 843. A court does not need to reach this second step if, employing traditional tools of statutory construction, [it] ascertains that Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue Id. at 843 n.9. Similarly, in Lamie v. United States Trustee, the Court noted that when a statutes language is plain, the sole function of the courts-at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd-is to enforce it according to its terms. 540 U.S. 526, 534 (2004). Furthermore, in America's Cmty. Bankers v. F.D.I.C., the Court explained that when a federal statute is clear and unambiguous then there is nothing for an agency to interpret and the court must give effect to that unambiguous expression of Congress. 200 F.3d 822, 833-34 (2000). This remains the case even when the executive agency at issue is the one tasked with enforcing that particular federal statute. Id.\nAs it pertains to the issue at hand, the DEA cannot promulgate a rule the directly conflicts the will of Congress as expressed by the AIA and the CSA. As previously noted, Congress expressly exempted hemp plants, including hemp derivatives and extracts, from the CSA. This exemption presumably encompasses all products that can be derived from hemp including THCs or salts (to the extent that both products are derived or extracted from hemp). There can be no assurance that the AIA will not be modified to conform to the DEAs regulations regarding the regulatory controls over marihuana, tetrahydrocannabinols, and other marihuana-related constituents in the CSA.\nEstimate Of The Amount Of Money Spent During Each Of The Last Two Fiscal Years On Research And Development\nOther than time spent researching our business and proposed markets and segmentation, we have not spent any funds on research and development activities to date. In the event opportunities arise from our operations, we may elect to initiate research and development activities, but we have no plans for any activities to date.\nCosts and Effects Of Compliance With Environmental Laws\nOur operations are not subject to any environmental laws or regulations.\nNumber Of Total Employees And Number Of Full-Time Employees\nAs of this filing, the Company has 1 full time employee and no persons working part time in various functions.\nWe do not provide an employer contribution for healthcare, pension, annuity, insurance, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt plans in the future.\nImplications of Being an Emerging Growth Company\nWe qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD&A;\n\u00b7 Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth companys internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u00b7 Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth companys executive compensation arrangements; and\n\u00b7 No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.\nWe have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this Form 10-K, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act).\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing to utilize the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act. This election allows our Company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nWe could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.\nWe are a reporting company and file all reports required under sections 13 and 15d of the Exchange Act. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nBecause we are a Smaller Reporting Company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone. Item 2. Properties.\nOur corporate address is PMB 388, 8570 Stirling Rd., Suite 102, Hollywood, Florida, 33024\nIn December 2021, the Company confirmed with the landlord that as of that time and on a going forward basis, the Company has no rental obligation, or past due rental obligation or any other related liability on its office/ warehouse space located at 3017 Greene Street, Hollywood, Florida.\nOn October 22, 2021, the Company entered into a lease termination agreement (Lease Termination) with Canal Park Office to terminate the Companys North Miami Beach, Florida office space. The Termination Agreement allows Canal Park Office to retain the security deposit of $24,799 and to be paid $21,000. The Company was released from any other obligations.\nWe believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current needs and that we will be able to lease suitable additional or alternative space on commercially reasonable terms if and when we need it. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nFrom time to time, various lawsuits and legal proceedings may arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these, or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any legal proceedings or claims that it believes will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or operating results except:\nFirst Capital Venture\nOn November 3, 2020, First Capital Venture Co., a subsidiary of the client, d/b/a Diamond CBD, filed a civil complaint against Thunder Energies Corporation (the Defendants), in the pending 17th Judicial Circuit Court in and for Broward County, Florida, (the Florida Court), Case Number CACE-20-019111 (the Complaint).\nOn January 26, 2021 Plaintiffs were erroneously granted an Order of Default to which the Defendants immediately pointed out to the Court and on February 23, 2021 an Order Vacating the Default was granted in favor of the Defendants. The Plaintiff knew, or should have known, that the Order of Default was not valid but they proceeded on February 9, 2021 to publish false and misleading press releases.\nThunder Energies Corporation is proceeding through discovery and is of the belief the suit will be decided in their favor. A pending Motion to Dismiss is before the Court. Plaintiffs Complaint is based on a claim for tortious interference and misappropriation of trade secrets. Neither claim is supported by the Complaint.\nThunder Energies Corporation has issued a cease and desist to the Plaintiff and is considering a counter claim concerning the false information and disclosures made by the Plaintiff that may have affected the Companys business and shareholders.\nThe Company is unable to predict the financial outcome of this matter at this time, and any views formed as to the viability of these claims or the financial exposure which could result may change from time to time as the matter proceeds through its course. Accordingly, adjustments, if any, that might result from the resolution of this matter have not been reflected in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is confident to obtain a summary judgement in their favor on the trade secret allegations and hence has not provided for any financial exposure. However, no assurance can be made that this matter together with the potential for reputational harm, will not result in a material financial exposure, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nFiling of Complaint Against Certain Former Officers and Other Parties\nOn October 14, 2021 Nature Consulting, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, filed a complaint in the United States District Court of the Southern District of Florida against Or-El Ben Simon, individually, Adam Levy (previously the Chief Executive Officer of the Company), individually, Solange Baruk (previously a bookkeeper of the Company), individually, DVP Distro, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, Custom Graphics 2011, Inc. a Florida corporation, Beso Group, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, and Tops Consulting, LLC a Florida limited liability company (collectively, the Defendants).

This has caused Natures clients to threaten Nature with suit and to otherwise end their business relationships with Nature due to Natures failure to satisfy orders. Even if Nature wanted to operate, due to the unlawful interception of its communications with clients and vendors, it would be impossible.\nNature Consulting, LLC has demanded a jury trial to adjudicate this complaint.\nAs a result of the actions of the Defendants, the Company recorded a net impairment charge of $195,347 during the year ended December 31, 2021 comprised of the following:\nDecember 31,\nImpairment charges:\nPrepaids $ (12,500 )\nInventories (136,309 )\nNet office equipment (18,586 )\nNet computer equipment (15,283 )\nNet machinery and equipment (21,782 )\nNet leasehold improvements (79,665 )\nNet website (64,100 )\nNet operating lease right-of-use assets (306,902 )\nDeposits(2) (24,799 )\nDue to related party(1) 169,744\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities(2) (3) 187,754\nOperating lease liabilities net of current portion(2) (3) 127,081\nTotal impairment charges $ (195,347 )\n(1) The Company has included due to related party of $169,744 within the impairment charge above as these amounts have been used to settle the assets, as impaired, which have been commandeered, discarded, destroyed and taken possession of by the defendant.

Results for the reporting periods beginning on January 19, 2019 (date of formation) are presented under ASC 606.\nThe Company generates all of its revenue from contracts with customers. The Company recognizes revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\n1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer.\n2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract.\n3. Determination of the transaction price.\n4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n5. Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nAt contract inception, the Company assesses the services promised in our contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a service (or bundle of services) that is distinct. To identify the performance obligations, the Company considers all of the services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. The Company allocates the entire transaction price to a single performance obligation.\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities are as follows:\nOther sales - The Company offers consumer products through its online websites. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded retail sales of $3,750,519 (included in discontinued operations) and $4,620,105 (included in discontinued operations), respectively.\nMask sales - As a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, in 2020, the Company entered into the sale of KN95 masks but had to dispose of them at a loss. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded mask sales of $0 (included in discontinued operations) and $3,054,201 (included in discontinued operations), respectively.\nThe Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs, or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when the Company is primarily obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded at the gross sale price. The Company generally records the net amounts as commissions earned if we are not primarily obligated and do not have latitude in establishing prices.\nRevenue is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer, provided that collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. The Company primarily provides for no credit terms as it collects a deposit of 50% upon order and requires the remaining 50% be paid before the order is shipped. When credit terms are granted, terms of up to 120 days are provided, based on credit evaluations. No allowance has been provided for uncollectible accounts. Management has evaluated the receivables and believes they are collectible based on the nature of the receivables, historical experience of credit losses, and all other currently available evidence. Discounts are recorded as a reduction of the transaction price. Revenue excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales taxes.\nResults of Operations.\nThe results of operations are based on preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

The primary sources of funding for such requirements are expected to be cash generated from operations and raising additional funds from the private sources and/or debt financing. However, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and/or obtain additional financing on terms satisfactory to us, if at all, to remain a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitability. Our Plan of Operation for the next twelve months is to raise capital to implement our strategy. We do not have the necessary cash and revenue to satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months. We cannot guarantee that additional funding will be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, then we may not be able to expand our operations. If adequate funds are not available, we believe that our officers and directors will contribute funds to pay for some of our expenses. However, we have not made any arrangements or agreements with our officers and directors regarding such advancement of funds. We do not know whether we will issue stock for the loans or whether we will merely prepare and sign promissory notes. If we are forced to seek funds from our officers or directors, we will negotiate the specific terms and conditions of such loan when made, if ever. Although we are not presently engaged in any capital raising activities, we anticipate that we may engage in one or more private offering of our companys securities after the completion of this offering. We would most likely rely upon the transaction exemptions from registration provided by Regulation D, Rule 506 or conduct another private offering under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. See Note 2 - Going Concern in our financial statements for additional information as to the possibility that we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nWe are not aware of any trends or known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in material increases or decreases in liquidity.\nDue to Former Shareholder\nOn March 1, 2020, the members of Nature entered into the Ownership Interest Purchase Agreement (Ownership Agreement) whereby Yogev Shvo, a member of the Company, acquired the remaining 50% member ownership (Seller) giving Mr. Shvo 100% member ownership of the Company.

In exchange, the Company issued Fourth & One a promissory note of $4,000,000 and 2,000 RoRa Prime digital coins (Coins), valued at $1,450,000. The promissory note provides for no interest and matures on October 31, 2022 (Maturity Date). In addition, the promissory note provides that the Company may convert all amounts at any time prior to the Maturity Date and after gaining approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Companys REG A II Offering and Fourth & One may convert all amounts into common stock prior to the Maturity Date at a conversion price of $2.00 per share. The Agreement also provides that should Fourth & One not be able to convert the Coins on or before October 31, 2022 at a conversion ratio of $800 per Coin, the Company will purchase all of the Coins for a total of $1,600,000 (2,000 Coins at $800 per Coin) on October 31, 2022.\nPromissory Debenture\nOn February 15, 2020 and on May 14, 2020, the Company entered into Promissory Agreement and Convertible Debentures (Promissory Debentures) with Emry for a principal sum of $70,000 (which was paid in two tranches: $50,000, paid on February 15, 2020, and $20,000, paid in April 2020) and $48,000 (which was paid in three tranches: $23,000, paid on May 14, 2020, $15,000, paid on May 22, 2020, and $10,000, paid on June 8, 2020), respectively. The Promissory Debenture bears interest, both before and after default, at 15% per month, calculated and compounded monthly. At the election of the holder, at any time during the period between the date of issuance and the one year anniversary of the Promissory Debentures, the Promissory Debentures are convertible into shares of the Companys common stock at any time at a conversion price of $0.001 per share. In addition, the Promissory Debentures provide for an interest equal to 15% of the Companys annual sales, payable on the 2nd day following the date of issuance of the Companys audited financial statements.\nOn June 24, 2020, Emry, holder of (i) Promissory Debentures in principal amount of $70,000 dated February 15, 2020, and (ii) that certain convertible promissory note in principal amount of $85,766 dated April 22, 2019, sold 50% of each (Promissory Debentures and convertible promissory note), including accrued and unpaid interest, fees and penalties, in separate transactions to third party companies, SP11 Capital Investments and E.L.S.R. CORP, Florida companies, such that SP11 Capital Investments and E.L.S.R. CORP each hold 50% of each respective debt instrument.\nOn October 4, 2020, SP11 converted $35,000 of its Promissory Debentures at $0.01 per share into 3,500,000 shares of the Companys common stock.\nOn November 22, 2021, the loan of $48,000 and accrued and unpaid interest of $573,798 totaling $621,798 was forgiven by EMRY and recorded as a gain on extinguishment of debt in Other Expense in the consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAs a result of the failure to timely file our Form 10-Q for the three month period ended September 30, 2020 and the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Promissory Debentures were in default. On July 15, 2021, the Company entered into a Waiver Agreement (the Agreement) waiving the default provisions listed in the $48,000 note related to the Companys failure to timely file its Form 10-Q for the three month period ended September 30, 2020 and the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $35,000 note provides for no default penalties.\nStock Transactions\nOn December 6, 2021, the holder of the note converted $190,000 of the Note into 3,800,000 shares of the Companys common stock for a balance due of $410,000 at December 31, 2021 on the Note.\nOn October 13, 2020, the Company issued 195,480 common shares, valued at $33,232 (based on the Companys stock price on the date of issuance), to GHS Investments in settlement.\nOn October 4, 2020, SP11 converted $35,000 of its Promissory Debentures at $0.01 per share into 3,500,000 shares of the Companys common stock.\nOn August 14, 2020, the Company issued 60,000,000 common shares in conjunction with acquisition.\nEmployment Agreements\nOn March 1, 2022, as amended on October 1, 2022, Mr. Ricardo Haynes, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and President (CEO) entered into an Employment Agreement with the Company.

The consulting agreement is in effect until the Company is profitable with a balance sheet of over $200 million or thirty-six (36) months, whichever is longer. Under this consulting agreement, the related party will be entitled to a total of 5,000,000 common, vest immediately, valued at $150,000 (based on the Companys stock price on the date of issuance) and will be expensed over the thirty-six (36) term of the Consulting agreement.\nCapital Resources.\nWe had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2021.\nFiscal year end\nOur fiscal year end is December 31.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $2,020,464 and $647,914 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, had a working capital deficit of $2,583,421 and $1,569,288 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, had a net losses of $1,372,550 and $550,602 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, with limited revenue earned since inception, no current revenue generating operations, and a lack of operational history. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Companys financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating cost and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.\nIn order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Managements plan to obtain such resources for the Company include, obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses. However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. In addition, profitability will ultimately depend upon the level of revenues received from business operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will attain profitability. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Commission has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies that are significant to understanding our results.\nThe following are deemed to be the most significant accounting policies affecting us.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The more significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others: inventory valuation, common stock valuation, and the recoverability of intangibles. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 19, 2019 (date of formation), the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606 (ASC 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Results for the reporting periods beginning on January 19, 2019 (date of formation) are presented under ASC 606.\nThe Company generates all of its revenue from contracts with customers. The Company recognizes revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\n1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer.\n2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract.\n3. Determination of the transaction price.\n4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n5. Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nAt contract inception, the Company assesses the services promised in our contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a service (or bundle of services) that is distinct. To identify the performance obligations, the Company considers all of the services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. The Company allocates the entire transaction price to a single performance obligation.\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities are as follows:\nOther sales - The Company offers consumer products through its online websites. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded retail sales of $3,750,519 (included in discontinued operations) and $4,620,105 (included in discontinued operations), respectively.\nMask sales - As a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, in 2020, the Company entered into the sale of KN95 masks but had to dispose of them at a loss. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded mask sales of $0 (included in discontinued operations) and $3,054,201 (included in discontinued operations), respectively.\nThe Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when the Company is primarily obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded at the gross sale price. The Company generally records the net amounts as commissions earned if we are not primarily obligated and do not have latitude in establishing prices.\nRevenue is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer, provided that collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. The Company primarily provides for no credit terms as it collects a deposit of 50% upon order and requires the remaining 50% be paid before the order is shipped. When credit terms are granted, terms of up to 120 days are provided, based on credit evaluations. No allowance has been provided for uncollectible accounts. Management has evaluated the receivables and believes they are collectible based on the nature of the receivables, historical experience of credit losses, and all other currently available evidence. Discounts are recorded as a reduction of the transaction price. Revenue excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales taxes.\nCustomer Advanced Payments\nCustomer advanced payments consists of customer orders paid in advance of the delivery of the order. Customer advanced payments are classified as short-term as the typical order ships within approximately three weeks of placing the order. Customer advanced payments are recognized as revenue when the product is shipped to the customer and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Customer advanced payments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $203,518 (included in discontinued operations) and $522,258 (included in discontinued operations), respectively. Customer advanced payments are included in current liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated Balance Sheets. The Companys ability to fulfill these orders have been impaired (see Note 1).\nInventories\nThe Company manufactures its own products, made to order, and when completed are shipped to the customer. The Company's inventories are valued by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company had inventories of $0 (included in discontinued operations) and $168,470 (included in discontinued operations), respectively, consisting of mostly finished goods as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 1 for impairment discussion as of December 31, 2021.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist primarily of developed technology - website. Our intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of three years.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe periodically evaluate whether the carrying value of property, equipment and intangible assets has been impaired when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. The carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the discounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value is not recoverable, the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value. There are no impairments as of December 31, 2020. See Note 1 for impairment discussion as of December 31, 2021.\nOur impairment analyses require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows as well as asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets, assessing the probability of different outcomes, and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. If the carrying value is not recoverable, we assess the fair value of long-lived assets using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to, recent third-party comparable sales and discounted cash flow models. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to an impairment charge in the future.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a result of the Companys Interest Purchase Agreement, the Company converted to a corporation (Conversion). Beginning on August 14, 2020, the Companys results of operations are taxed as a C Corporation. Prior to the Conversion, the Companys operations were taxed as a limited liability company, whereby the Company elected to be taxed as a partnership and the income or loss was required to be reported by each respective member on their separate income tax returns. Therefore, no provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for periods prior to August 14, 2020.\nThe computation of income taxes included in the Statements of Operations, represents the tax effects that would have been reported had the Company been subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes as a corporation for all periods presented. Taxes are based upon the statutory income tax rates and adjustments to income for estimated permanent differences occurring during each period. Actual rates and expenses could have differed had the Company actually been subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes for all periods presented.\nWe account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach. This process involves calculating the temporary and permanent differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which would be recorded on our balance sheets in accordance with ASC 740, which established financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. We must assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Changes in our valuation allowance in a period are recorded through the income tax provision on the consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFrom the date of our inception, we adopted ASC 740-10-30. ASC 740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entitys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Additionally, ASC 740-10 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. As a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10, and currently, we do not have a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe provisions of accounting guidance, FASB Topic ASC 825 requires all entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value, and defines fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and notes payable approximated carrying value due to the short maturity of the instruments, quoted market prices or interest rates which fluctuate with market rates.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, as follows:\n\u00b7 Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\u00b7 Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n\u00b7 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. There were no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. There have been no transfers between levels.\nThe derivatives are evaluated under the hierarchy of ASC 480-10, ASC Paragraph 815-25-1 and ASC Subparagraph 815-10-15-74 addressing embedded derivatives. The fair value of the Level 3 financial instruments was performed internally by the Company using the Black Scholes valuation method.\nThe following table summarize the Companys fair value measurements by level at December 31, 2021 for the assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nDerivative liability $ - $ - $ 83,404\nThe following table summarize the Companys fair value measurements by level at December 31, 2020 for the assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nDerivative liability $ - $ - $ 124,180\nThe carrying values of the Companys financial instruments, including cash, other current assets, accounts payable, accruals, and other current liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short period of time to maturity or repayment.\nDebt\nWe issue debt that may have separate warrants, conversion features, or no equity-linked attributes.\nDebt with warrants - When we issue debt with warrants, we treat the warrants as a debt discount, record as a contra-liability against the debt, and amortize the balance over the life of the underlying debt as amortization of debt discount expense in the consolidated statements of operations. When the warrants require equity treatment under ASC 815, the offset to the contra-liability is recorded as additional paid in capital in our consolidated balance sheet. When we issue debt with warrants that require liability treatment under ASC 815, such as a clause requiring repricing, the warrants are considered to be a derivative that is recorded as a liability at fair value. If the initial value of the warrant derivative liability is higher than the fair value of the associated debt, the excess is recognized immediately as interest expense. The warrant derivative liability is adjusted to its fair value at the end of each reporting period, with the change being recorded as expense or gain. If the debt is retired early, the associated debt discount is then recognized immediately as amortization of debt discount expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The debt is treated as conventional debt.\nConvertible debt - derivative treatment - When we issue debt with a conversion feature, we must first assess whether the conversion feature meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative, as follows: a) one or more underlyings, typically the price of our common stock; b) one or more notional amounts or payment provisions or both, generally the number of shares upon conversion; c) no initial net investment, which typically excludes the amount borrowed; and d) net settlement provisions, which in the case of convertible debt generally means the stock received upon conversion can be readily sold for cash. An embedded equity-linked component that meets the definition of a derivative does not have to be separated from the host instrument if the component qualifies for the scope exception for certain contracts involving an issuers own equity. The scope exception applies if the contract is both a) indexed to its own stock; and b) classified in shareholders equity in its statement of financial position.\nIf the conversion feature within convertible debt meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative, we estimate the fair value of the convertible debt derivative using the Black Scholes method upon the date of issuance. If the fair value of the convertible debt derivative is higher than the face value of the convertible debt, the excess is immediately recognized as interest expense. Otherwise, the fair value of the convertible debt derivative is recorded as a liability with an offsetting amount recorded as a debt discount, which offsets the carrying amount of the debt. The convertible debt derivative is revalued at the end of each reporting period and any change in fair value is recorded as a gain or loss in the statement of operations. The debt discount is amortized through interest expense over the life of the debt.\nConvertible debt - beneficial conversion feature - If the conversion feature is not treated as a derivative, we assess whether it is a beneficial conversion feature (BCF). A BCF exists if the conversion price of the convertible debt instrument is less than the stock price on the commitment date. This typically occurs when the conversion price is less than the fair value of the stock on the date the instrument was issued. The value of a BCF is equal to the intrinsic value of the feature, the difference between the conversion price and the common stock into which it is convertible and is recorded as additional paid in capital and as a debt discount in the consolidated balance sheet. We amortize the balance over the life of the underlying debt as amortization of debt discount expense in the statement of operations. If the debt is retired early, the associated debt discount is then recognized immediately as amortization of debt discount expense in the statement of operations.\nIf the conversion feature does not qualify for either the derivative treatment or as a BCF, the convertible debt is treated as traditional debt.\nDiscontinued Operations\nAs a result of the October 14, 2021 Complaint filed against Defendants, the Company determined that Nature Consulting LLC would be accounted as a discontinued operation pursuant to ASC 205-20 Discontinued Operations. In determining whether a group of assets that is disposed (or to be disposed) should be presented as a discontinued operation, we analyzed whether the group of assets being disposed represents a component of the Company; that is, whether it had historic operations and cash flows that were clearly distinguished, both operationally and for financial reporting purposes. In addition, we considered whether the disposal represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. The results of discontinued operations, as well as any gain or loss on the disposal, if applicable, are aggregated and separately presented in our consolidated statements of operations, net of income taxes. The historical financial position of discontinued operations are aggregated and separately presented in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 3 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nFuture Contractual Obligations and Commitments\nRefer to Note 3 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for future contractual obligations and commitments. Future contractual obligations and commitments are based on the terms of the relevant agreements and appropriate classification of items under U.S. GAAP as currently in effect. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these amounts.\nWe incur contractual obligations and financial commitments in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Contractual obligations include future cash payments required under existing contracts, such as debt and lease agreements. These obligations may result from both general financing activities and from commercial arrangements that are directly supported by related operating activities. Details on these obligations are set forth below.\nDue to Former Shareholder - discontinued operations\nOn March 1, 2020, the members of Nature entered into the Ownership Interest Purchase Agreement (Ownership Agreement) whereby Yogev Shvo, a member of the Company, acquired the remaining 50% member ownership (Seller) giving Mr. Shvo 100% member ownership of the Company. As consideration for the Ownership Agreement, the Seller received a Promissory Note of $750,000. The Promissory Note bears interest at 15% per annum and matures March 1, 2022, as amended on June 30, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company made repayments of $193,000 for a balance of $72,743 under Due to Related Parties in the accompanying Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021. The Note is secured with the assets of the Company pursuant to a security agreement dated March 1, 2020. In addition, the Companys CEO has personally guaranteed the Note.\nLoans Payable\nLoan Payable to Shareholder - discontinued operations\nThe Company borrows funds from its shareholders from time to time for working capital purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had no additional borrowings and made repayments of $68,405 for a balance of $0 at December 31, 2021. Advances are non-interest bearing and due on demand.\nEconomic Injury Disaster Loan - discontinued operations\nOn May 14, 2020, the Company executed the standard loan documents required for securing a loan (the EIDL Loan) from the SBA under its Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) assistance program in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Companys business.\nPursuant to that certain Loan Authorization and Agreement (the SBA Loan Agreement), the Company borrowed an aggregate principal amount of the EIDL Loan of $150,000, with proceeds to be used for working capital purposes. Interest accrues at the rate of 3.75% per annum and will accrue only on funds actually advanced from the date of each advance. Installment payments, including principal and interest, are due monthly beginning May 14, 2021 (twelve months from the date of the SBA Note) in the amount of $731.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.\nThe registrant qualifies as a smaller reporting company, as defined by SEC Rule 229.10(f)(1) and is not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe report of the independent registered public accounting firm and the financial statements listed on the accompanying index at page of this report are filed as part of this report and incorporated herein by reference. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nWe did not have any disagreements on accounting and financial disclosure with our accounting firm during the reporting period. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-l5(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information that would be required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including to our Chairman and Principal Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chairman and Principal Accounting Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in SEC Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, management identified deficiencies that were determined to be a material weakness.\nManagements Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nThe Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-l5(f) of the Securities Exchange Act). Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (2013). Based on that assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2021, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was ineffective based on the COSO criteria, due to the following material weaknesses listed below.\nThe specific material weaknesses identified by the companys management as of end of the period covered by this report include the following:\n\u00b7 we have not performed a risk assessment and mapped our processes to control objectives;\n\u00b7 we have not implemented comprehensive entity-level internal controls;\n\u00b7 we have not implemented adequate system and manual controls. As such, there was inadequate cross functional review of the debt agreements; and\n\u00b7 we do not have sufficient segregation of duties. As such, the officers approve their own related business expense reimbursements.\nDespite the material weaknesses reported above, our management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented and that this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report.\nThis report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Commission that permit us to provide only managements report in this report.\nManagement's Remediation Plan\nThe weaknesses and their related risks are not uncommon in a company of our size because of the limitations in the size and number of staff. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties has not always been possible and may not be economically feasible.\nHowever, we plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to implement the following changes in the current fiscal year as resources allow:\n(i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and implement modifications to our financial controls to address such inadequacies.\nThe remediation efforts set out herein will be implemented in the current 2022 fiscal year. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.\nManagement believes that despite our material weaknesses set forth above, our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information.\nNONE\nPART III Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.\nDirectors and Executive Officers.\nThe names and ages of our directors and executive officers as of September 30, 2022 are set forth below. Our Bylaws provide for not less than one and not more than seven directors. All directors are elected annually by the stockholders to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified.\nName\nAge\nPosition\nMr. Ricardo Haynes (1)\nChairman, Principal Accounting Officer\n__________\n(1) Mr. Haynes was appointed Chairman and CEO on March 1, 2022. Mr. Haynes will serve as a director until the next annual shareholder meeting.\nMr. Ricardo Haynes, President/CEO\nMr. Haynes is 55 years old. He is a highly accomplished business development executive with more than 20 years of experience in producing exponential revenue growth, cultivating enduring relationships within the hospitality and financial industry. Worked for Marriot Corporation for over 15 years in property development, licensing and investment. Also operated in the financial industry providing corporate bond placement and project financing. Total experience includes commercial real estate sales and loan origination with regional and nationally based lending institutions, corporate finance consulting. Grass roots development experience in creating and issuing collateralized bond obligation and related instruments. Over the last 5 years Mr. Haynes has worked assisting clients in construction financing in both commercial and hospitality markets with Candela Group, Ltd. In Alberta, Canada.\nMr. Hayness qualifications to serve on our board of directors include his experience in commercial real estate development and financing.\nDirector Independence\nWe do not have any independent directors. Because our common stock is not currently listed on a national securities exchange, we have used the definition of independence of The NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an independent director is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the companys board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The NASDAQ listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent if:\n\u00b7 the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an employee of the company;\n\u00b7 the director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the company in excess of $120,000 during any period of 12 consecutive months within the three years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exclusions, including, among other things, compensation for board or board committee service);\n\u00b7 a family member of the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an executive officer of the company;\n\u00b7 the director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling stockholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to which the company made, or from which the company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5% of the recipients consolidated gross revenue for that year or $200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain exclusions);\n\u00b7 the director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past three years, any of the executive officers of the company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or\n\u00b7 the director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the Companys outside auditor, or at any time during the past three years was a partner or employee of the Companys outside auditor, and who worked on the companys audit.\nCommittees of the Board\nOur Company currently does not have nominating, compensation, or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our directors believe that it is not necessary to have such committees, at this time, because the directors can adequately perform the functions of such committees.\nIn lieu of an audit committee, the Companys board of directors is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Companys consolidated financial statements and other services provided by the Companys independent public accountants. The board of directors, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company review the Companys internal accounting controls, practices and policies.\nAudit Committee Financial Expert\nOur board of directors has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a board member that qualifies as independent as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14) of the FINRA Rules.\nWe believe that our directors are capable of analyzing and evaluating our consolidated financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. The directors of our Company do not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because management believes that the board of directors can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. In addition, we believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash flows from operations to date.\nInvolvement in Certain Legal Proceedings.\nFrom time to time, various lawsuits and legal proceedings may arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these, or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any legal proceedings or claims that it believes will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or operating results except:\nFirst Capital Venture\nOn November 3, 2020, First Capital Venture Co., a subsidiary of the client, d/b/a Diamond CBD, filed a civil complaint against Thunder Energies Corporation (the Defendants), in the pending 17th Judicial Circuit Court in and for Broward County, Florida, (the Florida Court), Case Number CACE-20-019111 (the Complaint).\nOn January 26, 2021 Plaintiffs were erroneously granted an Order of Default to which the Defendants immediately pointed out to the Court and on February 23, 2021 an Order Vacating the Default was granted in favor of the Defendants. The Plaintiff knew, or should have known, that the Order of Default was not valid but they proceeded on February 9, 2021 to publish false and misleading press releases.\nThunder Energies Corporation is proceeding through discovery and is of the belief the suit will be decided in their favor. A pending Motion to Dismiss is before the Court. Plaintiffs Complaint is based on a claim for tortious interference and misappropriation of trade secrets. Neither claim is supported by the Complaint.\nThunder Energies Corporation has issued a cease and desist to the Plaintiff and is considering a counter claim concerning the false information and disclosures made by the Plaintiff that may have affected the Companys business and shareholders.\nThe Company is unable to predict the financial outcome of this matter at this time, and any views formed as to the viability of these claims or the financial exposure which could result may change from time to time as the matter proceeds through its course. Accordingly, adjustments, if any, that might result from the resolution of this matter have not been reflected in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is confident to obtain a summary judgement in their favor on the trade secret allegations and hence has not provided for any financial exposure. However, no assurance can be made that this matter together with the potential for reputational harm, will not result in a material financial exposure, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nFiling of Complaint Against Certain Former Officers and Other Parties\nOn October 14, 2021 Nature Consulting, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, filed a complaint in the United States District Court of the Southern District of Florida against Or-El Ben Simon, individually, Adam Levy (previously the Chief Executive Officer of the Company), individually, Solange Baruk (previously a bookkeeper of the Company), individually, DVP Distro, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, Custom Graphics 2011, Inc. a Florida corporation, Beso Group, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, and Tops Consulting, LLC a Florida limited liability company (collectively, the Defendants). The complaint alleges that the Defendants assumed control of Nature Consulting, LLC and in doing so:\n(a) Violated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. ss2511\n(b) Violated the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. ss2701\n(c) Violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. ss1030\n(d) Committed Conversion in the taking control of Nature Consulting, LLCs premises (Ben Simon, DVP, Custom, Beso and Tops)\n(e) Committed Tortious Interference with Prospective Economic Opportunities\n(f) Committed Breach of Fiduciary Duty of Loyalty (Baruk)\n(g) Committed Civil Conspiracy (Ben Simon, Levy and Baruk)\n(h) Violated the Defend Trade Secrets Act Theft of Trade Secrets, 18 U.S.C. ss1832\nBen Simon and those in active consort with him have effectively hijacked Natures assets under the threat of force and physical violence. Moreover, they have systematically divested Nature of its assets, moved into its physical location without reason, and have otherwise converted its assets.\nDuring this time, Defendants also assumed control of all computers belonging to Nature - including its Office365 access and database registered to Nature and using the domains of @thpcbd.com, @thehemplug.com, and @natureconsulting.com.\nAdditionally, Defendants looted and destroyed the premises leased by Nature, as follows:\na. Defendants commandeered all inventory belonging to Nature and refused to distribute to clients;\nb. Defendants commandeered a forklift belonging to Nature;\nc. Defendants have taken possession of all of Natures furniture, computers, printers, packaging, machineries, office supplies, phone systems, televisions, security cameras and other electronics;\nd. Defendants have discarded in a large trash container Natures merchandise, customer labels, catalogues, business cards, desks, office decorations and other inventory;\ne. Defendants destroyed Natures property by stripping its headquarters of all aesthetic enhancements and signage;\nf. Defendants assumed control of all e-mail accounts belonging to Nature and have intercepted Natures communications sent to the domain @thpcbd.com, @thehemplug.com, and @natureconsulting.com; and,\ng. Defendants have terminated Natures contracts with other vendors - to do this, they have used the commandeered @thpcbd.com, @thehemplug.com, and @natureconsulting.com email addresses.\nFurthermore, Defendants conduct have impeded the fulfillment of orders already paid for by Natures clients. This has caused Natures clients to threaten Nature with suit and to otherwise end their business relationships with Nature due to Natures failure to satisfy orders. Even if Nature wanted to operate, due to the unlawful interception of its communications with clients and vendors, it would be impossible.\nNature Consulting, LLC has demanded a jury trial to adjudicate this complaint.\nAs a result of the actions of the Defendants, the Company recorded a net impairment charge of $195,347 during the year ended December 31, 2021 comprised of the following:\nDecember 31,\nImpairment charges:\nPrepaids $ (12,500 )\nInventories (136,309 )\nNet office equipment (18,586 )\nNet computer equipment (15,283 )\nNet machinery and equipment (21,782 )\nNet leasehold improvements (79,665 )\nNet website (64,100 )\nNet operating lease right-of-use assets (306,902 )\nDeposits(2) (24,799 )\nDue to related party(1) 169,744\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities(2) (3) 187,754\nOperating lease liabilities net of current portion(2) (3) 127,081\nTotal impairment charges $ (195,347 )\n(1) The Company has included due to related party of $169,744 within the impairment charge above as these amounts have been used to settle the assets, as impaired, which have been commandeered, discarded, destroyed and taken possession of by the defendant. This amount related to working capital loan taken from the defendants.\n(2) On October 22, 2021, the Company entered into a lease termination agreement (Lease Termination) with Canal Park Office to terminate the Companys North Miami Beach, Florida office space. The Termination Agreement allows Canal Park Office to retain the security deposit of $24,799 and to be paid $21,000. The Company was released from any other obligations.\n(3) In December 2021, the Company confirmed with the landlord that as of that time and on a going forward basis, the Company has no rental obligation, or past due rental obligation or any other related liability on its office/ warehouse space located at 3017 Greene Street, Hollywood, Florida.\nRocket Systems\nOn October 13, 2021, Rocket Systems, Inc. (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Nature Consulting LLC (Nature) in the pending 17th Judicial Circuit Court in and for Broward County, Florida, (the Florida Court), Case Number CACE-21-018840 (the Complaint).\nThe complaint alleges that the Plaintiff paid Nature a deposit of $50,000 for the delivery of Nature products. According to the Complaint, Nature delivered $6,188 of the product but failed to deliver the remaining $43,812 of product.\nPlaintiff has demanded that the remainder of the product order be canceled and the refund of $43,812. In addition, the Plaintiff is seeking prejudgment interest and costs of this action.\nThe Company is unable to predict the financial outcome of this matter at this time, and any views formed as to the viability of these claims or the financial exposure which could result may change from time to time as the matter proceeds through its course. Accordingly, adjustments, if any, that might result from the resolution of this matter have not been reflected in the consolidated financial statements except that Nature has recorded a reserve of $43,812 as of December 31, 2021. The Company is confident to obtain a summary judgement in their favor on the trade secret allegations and hence has not provided for any financial exposure. However, no assurance can be made that this matter together with the potential for reputational harm, will not result in a material financial exposure, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nHome Remedies CBD\nOn November 23, 2021, Home Remedies CBD, LLC (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against TheHemplug LLC (THP) in the pending 3rd Judicial Circuit Court in and for Wayne County, Michigan, (the Michigan Court), Case Number CACE-21-016306-CB (the Complaint).\nThe complaint alleges that the Plaintiff paid Nature a deposit of $60,030 for the delivery of THP products. According to the Complaint, Nature delivered $27,600 of the product but failed to deliver the remaining $32,430 of product. In addition, Plaintiff returned $4,575 of product to correct the labeling and that THP failed to correct the labeling and return the product to Plaintiff.\nPlaintiff has demanded that the remainder of the product order be canceled and a refund of $37,005. In addition, the Plaintiff is seeking prejudgment interest and costs of this action.\nThe Company is unable to predict the financial outcome of this matter at this time, and any views formed as to the viability of these claims or the financial exposure which could result may change from time to time as the matter proceeds through its course. Accordingly, adjustments, if any, that might result from the resolution of this matter have not been reflected in the consolidated financial statements except that THP has recorded a reserve of $15,000 as of December 31, 2021. The Company is confident to obtain a summary judgement in their favor on the trade secret allegations and hence has not provided for any financial exposure. However, no assurance can be made that this matter together with the potential for reputational harm, will not result in a material financial exposure, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOn July 19, 2022, THP agreed to pay Plaintiff a settlement of $15,000.\nApart from the involvement in certain legal proceedings, there have been no events under any bankruptcy act, no criminal proceedings and no judgments, injunctions, orders of decrees material to the evaluation of the ability and integrity of any director, executive officer, promoter or control person of Registrant during the past ten years.\nThe Board of Directors acts as the Audit Committee, and the Board has no separates committees. The Company has no qualified financial expert at this time because it has not been able to hire a qualified candidate. Further, the Company believes that it has inadequate financial resources at this time to hire such expert. The Company intends to continue to search for a qualified individual for hire.\nA.

The Company intends to continue to search for a qualified individual for hire.\nConflicts of Interest\nCertain potential conflicts of interest are inherent in the relationships between our officers and directors and us.\nFrom time to time, one or more of our affiliates may form or hold an ownership interest in and/or manage other businesses both related and unrelated to the type of business that we own and operate. These persons expect to continue to form, hold an ownership interest in and/or manage additional other businesses which may compete with our business with respect to operations, including financing and marketing, management time and services and potential customers. These activities may give rise to conflicts between or among the interests of us and other businesses with which our affiliates are associated. Our affiliates are in no way prohibited from undertaking such activities, and neither we nor our shareholders will have any right to require participation in such other activities.\nWe may transact business with some of our officers, directors and affiliates, as well as with firms in which some of our officers, directors or affiliates have a material interest, potential conflicts may arise between the respective interests of us and these related persons or entities. We believe that such transactions will be effected on terms at least as favorable to us as those available from unrelated third parties. As of this filing, we have not transacted business with any officer, director, or affiliate.\nWith respect to transactions involving real or apparent conflicts of interest, we have adopted policies and procedures which require that: (i) the fact of the relationship or interest giving rise to the potential conflict be disclosed or known to the directors who authorize or approve the transaction prior to such authorization or approval, (ii) the transaction be approved by a majority of our disinterested outside directors, and (iii) the transaction be fair and reasonable to us at the time it is authorized or approved by our directors.\nOur policies and procedures regarding transactions involving potential conflicts of interest are not in writing. We understand that it will be difficult to enforce our policies and procedures and will rely on and trust our officers and directors to follow our policies and procedures. We will implement our policies and procedures by requiring the officer or director who is not in compliance with our policies and procedures to remove himself and the other officers and directors will decide how to implement the policies and procedures, accordingly.\nSection 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance\nOur shares of common stock are registered under the Exchange Act, and therefore our officers, directors and holders of more than 10% of our outstanding shares are subject to the provisions of Section 16(a) which requires them to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of common stock and our other equity securities. Officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. Based solely upon our review of reports submitted to us during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the following table sets forth the name of any such person that failed to file the required forms on a timely basis, including the number of late reports, the number of transactions not reported on a timely basis and any known failure to file a required form.\nName\nNumber of late reports\nNumber of transactions not reported timely\nMr. Ricardo Haynes\nNone\nNone\nCode of Ethics\nWe have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our employees, officers and directors. In addition to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer are also subject to written policies and standards that are reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote: honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships; full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that are filed with, or submitted to the SEC and in other public communications made by us; compliance with applicable government laws, rules and regulations; the prompt internal reporting of violations of the code to an appropriate person or persons identified in the code; and accountability for adherence to the code. We have posted the text of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics on our Internet website, www.slpc1.com. We intend to disclose future amendments to, or waivers from, certain provisions of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, if any, on our above Internet website within four business days following the date of such amendment or waiver.\nLegal Proceedings.\nTo the best of our knowledge, except as set forth herein, none of the directors or director designees to our knowledge has been convicted in a criminal proceeding, excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors, or has been a party to any judicial or administrative proceeding during the past five years that resulted in a judgment decree or final order enjoining the person from future violations of, or prohibiting activities subject to, federal or state securities laws, or finding of any violation of federal or state securities laws, except for matters that were dismissed without sanction or settlement.\nMeetings and Committees of the Board of Directors.\nWe do not have a nominating committee of the Board of Directors, or any committee performing similar functions. Nominees for election as a director are selected by the Board of Directors.\nWe do not yet have an audit committee or an audit committee financial expert. We expect to form such a committee composed of non-employee directors when such individuals are added to the board of directors. We may in the future attempt to add a qualified board member to serve as an audit committee financial expert in the future, subject to our ability to locate and compensate such a person. Despite the lack of an audit committee, those members of the board of directors that would otherwise be on our audit committee will continue to analyze and investigate our actual and potential businesses prospects as members of our board of directors. Furthermore, our entire board of directors is aware of the importance of the financial and accounting due diligence that must be undertaken in furtherance of our business and they intend to conduct a comprehensive accounting financial analysis of the Companys business.

We rely on our board to review related party transactions on an ongoing basis to prevent conflicts of interest. Our board reviews a transaction in light of the affiliations of the director, officer or employee and the affiliations of such persons immediate family. Transactions are presented to our board for approval before they are entered into or, if this is not possible, for ratification after the transaction has occurred. If our board finds that a conflict of interest exists, then it will determine the appropriate remedial action, if any. Our board approves or ratifies a transaction if it determines that the transaction is consistent with the best interests of the Company.

The Board of Directors takes the position that management of a target business will establish:\n\u00b7 Its own Board of Directors\n\u00b7 Establish its own definition of independent as related to directors and nominees for directors\n\u00b7 Establish committees that will be suitable for its operations after the Company consummates a business combination Item 14.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys significant operating losses and discontinued operations raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nImpairment of Assets\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2021, Ben Simon, and those in active consort with him effectively hijacked Natures assets under the threat of force and physical violence and systematically divested Nature of its assets, moved into its physical location without reason, and otherwise converted its assets. Hence, Nature Consulting, LLC filed a complaint in the United States District Court of the Southern District of Florida against them. As a result of the actions of the parties mentioned above, the Company recorded an impairment expense of $195,347 in the consolidated statement of operations.\nAuditing the Companys accounting for the impairment expense is complex due to the fact that all the assets, except cash were destroyed by the defendants and hence, the recoverable amount of these assets were zero. Further, there are legal proceeding going on for the Company as stated above and against the Company in relation to the customer advances, which impact the amount recoverable for these assets and potential liabilities to be settled. Auditing this areas is also complex due to the judgment in estimating the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities at the date of impairment.\nAs part of our testing, we ensured appropriate impairment expense has been recorded in the consolidated statement of operations by testing completeness and accuracy of these assets and related liabilities through reconciliation as of the impairment date. For Property and Equipment and Intangibles, we recalculated the depreciation and amortization expense through the impairment date and ensured that the related amount impaired is net book value on that date. For balances related to leases, we verified the respective agreements (including the termination agreement) and recalculated the balances related to operating lease right-of-use asset and operating lease liabilities which have been impaired. Further, we sent out confirmations to Companys attorney and vendors included in accounts payable to ensure completeness of liabilities.\n/s/ Paris, Kreit & Chiu CPA LLP\nNew York, NY\nOctober 18, 2022\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2020.\nTHUNDER ENERGIES CORPORATION\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nDecember 31,\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCurrent assets of discontinued operations $ -

The Amendment also changed the principal office address of the Company to 150 Rainville Road, Tarpon Springs, Florida 34689. On May 1, 2014, the Company filed with the Florida Secretary of State, Articles of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation (the Amendment) which changed the name of the Company from Thunder Fusion Corporation to Thunder Energies Corporation. The Company subsequently changed its principal office address to 3017 Greene St., Hollywood, Florida 33020.\nAcquisition of TNRG Preferred Stock\nOn July 1, 2020, Yogev Shvo, a third party individual and principal shareholder of Nature Consulting LLC (Nature or Purchaser) personally acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock (the Preferred Stock) of TNRG from Saveene Corporation, a Florida corporation (the Seller) (The Purchase). The purchase price of $250,000 for the Preferred Stock was paid in cash and was provided from the individual private funds of Purchaser.\nThe Preferred Stock acquired by the Purchaser consisted of:\n1. 50,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock wherein each share is entitled to fifteen (15) votes and converts into ten (10) shares of the Companys common stock.\n2. 5,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock wherein each share is entitled to one thousand (1,000) votes and converts into one thousand (1,000) shares of the Companys common stock.\n3. 10,000 shares of Series C Non-Convertible Preferred Stock wherein each share is entitled to one thousand (1,000) votes and is non-convertible into shares of the Companys common stock.\nAcquisition of Assets of Nature\nOn August 14, 2020 (the Closing Date), TNRG and the members of Nature entered into an Interest Purchase Agreement (the Interest Purchase Agreement), which closed on the same date. Pursuant to the terms of the Interest Purchase Agreement, the members of Nature sold all of their membership interests in Nature to TNRG in exchange for sixty million (60,000,000) shares of TNRGs Common Stock. As a result of this transaction, Nature became a wholly-owned subsidiary of TNRG.\nThe Interest Purchase Agreement contained customary representations and warranties and pre- and post-closing covenants of each party and customary closing conditions. Breaches of the representations and warranties will be subject to customary indemnification provisions, subject to specified aggregate limits of liability.\nThe membership Interest Purchase Agreement is treated as an asset acquisition by the Company for financial accounting purposes. Nature is considered the acquirer for accounting purposes, and the historical financial statements of Nature, before the membership exchange will replace the historical financial statements of TNRG before the membership exchange and in all future filings with the SEC.\nImmediately following the Interest Purchase Agreement, the business of Nature became TNRGs main operation. The Company was formed in February 2019.\nFiling of Complaint Against Certain Former Officers and Other Parties\nOn October 14, 2021 Nature Consulting, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, filed a complaint (Complaint) in the United States District Court of the Southern District of Florida against Or-El Ben Simon, individually, Adam Levy (previously the Chief Executive Officer of the Company), individually, Solange Baruk (previously a bookkeeper of the Company), individually, DVP Distro, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, Custom Graphics 2011, Inc. a Florida corporation, Beso Group, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, and Tops Consulting, LLC a Florida limited liability company (collectively, the Defendants).\nBen Simon and those in active consort with him have effectively hijacked Natures assets under the threat of force and physical violence. Moreover, they have systematically divested Nature of its assets, moved into its physical location without reason, and have otherwise converted its assets.\nDuring this time, Defendants also assumed control of all computers belonging to Nature - including its Office365 access and database registered to Nature and using the domains of @thpcbd.com, @thehemplug.com, and @natureconsulting.com.\nAdditionally, Defendants looted and destroyed the premises leased by Nature, as follows:\na. Defendants commandeered all inventory belonging to Nature and refused to distribute to clients;\nb. Defendants commandeered a forklift belonging to Nature;\nc. Defendants have taken possession of all of Natures furniture, computers, printers, packaging, machineries, office supplies, phone systems, televisions, security cameras and other electronics;\nd. Defendants have discarded in a large trash container Natures merchandise, customer labels, catalogues, business cards, desks, office decorations and other inventory;\ne. Defendants destroyed Natures property by stripping its headquarters of all aesthetic enhancements and signage;\nf. Defendants assumed control of all e-mail accounts belonging to Nature and have intercepted Natures communications sent to the domain @thpcbd.com, @thehemplug.com, and @natureconsulting.com; and,\ng. Defendants have terminated Natures contracts with other vendors - to do this, they have used the commandeered @thpcbd.com, @thehemplug.com, and @natureconsulting.com email addresses.\nFurthermore, Defendants conduct have impeded the fulfillment of orders already paid for by Natures clients. This has caused Natures clients to threaten Nature with suit and to otherwise end their business relationships with Nature due to Natures failure to satisfy orders. Even if Nature wanted to operate, due to the unlawful interception of its communications with clients and vendors, it would be impossible.\nNature Consulting, LLC has demanded a jury trial to adjudicate this complaint.\nAs a result of the actions of the Defendants, the Company recorded a net impairment charge of $195,347 during the year ended December 31, 2021 comprised of the following:\nSchedule of impairment charges\nDecember 31,\nImpairment charges:\nPrepaids $ (12,500 )\nInventories (136,309 )\nNet office equipment (18,586 )\nNet computer equipment (15,283 )\nNet machinery and equipment (21,782 )\nNet leasehold improvements (79,665 )\nNet website (64,100 )\nNet operating lease right-of-use assets (306,902 )\nDeposits(2) (24,799 )\nDue to related party(1) 169,744\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities(2) (3) 187,754\nOperating lease liabilities net of current portion(2) (3) 127,081\nTotal impairment charges $ (195,347 )\n(1) The Company has included due to related party of $169,744 within the impairment charge above as these amounts have been used to settle the assets, as impaired, which have been commandeered, discarded, destroyed and taken possession of by the defendant. This amount related to working capital loan taken from the defendants.\n(2) On October 22, 2021, the Company entered into a lease termination agreement (Lease Termination) with Canal Park Office to terminate the Companys North Miami Beach, Florida office space. The Termination Agreement allows Canal Park Office to retain the security deposit of $24,799 and to be paid $21,000. The Company was released from any other obligations.\n(3) In December 2021, the Company confirmed with the landlord that as of that time and on a going forward basis, the Company has no rental obligation, or past due rental obligation or any other related liability on its office/ warehouse space located at 3017 Greene Street, Hollywood, Florida.\nNOTE 2 - Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Companys financial position for the periods presented.\nThe Company currently operates in one business segment. The Company is not organized by market and is managed and operated as one business. A single management team reports to the chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, who comprehensively manages the entire business. The Company does not currently operate any separate lines of businesses or separate business entities.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $2,020,464 and $647,914 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, had a working capital deficit of $2,583,421 and $1,569,288 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, had a net losses of $1,372,550 and $550,602 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with limited revenue earned since inception, no current revenue generating operations, and a lack of operational history. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Companys financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating cost and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.\nIn order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Managements plan to obtain such resources for the Company include, obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses. However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. In addition, profitability will ultimately depend upon the level of revenues received from business operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will attain profitability.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThis summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is presented to assist in understanding the Companys consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements and notes are representations of the Companys management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to GAAP and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The more significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others: inventory valuation, common stock valuation, the recoverability of intangibles, derivative valuation, impairment of assets, and lease asset amortization. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions.\nCash\nThe Companys cash is held in bank accounts in the United States and is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000. The Company has not experienced any cash losses.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are non-interest-bearing obligations due under normal course of business. Management reviews accounts receivable on a monthly basis to determine if any receivables will be potentially uncollectible. Historical bad debts and current economic trends are used in evaluating the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company includes any accounts receivable balances that are determined to be uncollectible in its overall allowance for doubtful accounts. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. Based on the information available, the Company has an allowance for doubtful accounts of $147,357 (included in discontinued operations) and $14,350 (included in discontinued operations) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCash Flows Reporting\nThe Company follows ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category. The Company uses the indirect or reconciliation method (Indirect method) as defined by ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments.\nRelated Parties\nThe Company follows ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures, for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. Related parties are any entities or individuals that, through employment, ownership or other means, possess the ability to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Company.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a result of the Companys Interest Purchase Agreement, the Company converted to a corporation (Conversion). Beginning on August 14, 2020, the Companys results of operations are taxed as a C Corporation. Prior to the Conversion, the Companys operations were taxed as a limited liability company, whereby the Company elected to be taxed as a partnership and the income or loss was required to be reported by each respective member on their separate income tax returns. Therefore, no provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for periods prior to August 14, 2020.\nThe computation of income taxes included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, represents the tax effects that would have been reported had the Company been subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes as a corporation for all periods presented. Taxes are based upon the statutory income tax rates and adjustments to income for estimated permanent differences occurring during each period. Actual rates and expenses could have differed had the Company actually been subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes for all periods presented.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under an asset and liability approach. This process involves calculating the temporary and permanent differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which would be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with ASC 740, which established financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income must be assessed and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. Changes in the valuation allowance in a period are recorded through the income tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nASC 740-10-30 was adopted from the date of its inception. ASC 740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entitys consolidated financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Additionally, ASC 740-10 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. As a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10, and currently, the Company does not have a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits.\nAdvertising and Marketing Costs\nAdvertising and marketing expenses are recorded as marketing expenses when they are incurred. Advertising and marketing expense was $392,171 and $866,779 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 19, 2019 (date of formation), the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606 (ASC 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Results for the reporting periods beginning on January 19, 2019 (date of formation) are presented under ASC 606.\nThe Company generates all of its revenue from contracts with customers. The Company recognizes revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\n1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer.\n2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract.\n3. Determination of the transaction price.\n4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n5. Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nAt contract inception, the Company assesses the services promised in our contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a service (or bundle of services) that is distinct. To identify the performance obligations, the Company considers all of the services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. The Company allocates the entire transaction price to a single performance obligation.\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities are as follows:\nSales - The Company offers consumer products through its online websites. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded retail sales of $3,750,519 (included in discontinued operations) and $4,620,105 (included in discontinued operations), respectively.\nMask sales - As a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, in 2020, the Company entered into the sale of KN95 masks but had to dispose of them at a loss. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded mask sales of $0 (included in discontinued operations) and $3,054,201 (included in discontinued operations), respectively.\nThe Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when the Company is primarily obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded at the gross sale price. The Company generally records the net amounts as commissions earned if we are not primarily obligated and do not have latitude in establishing prices.\nRevenue is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer, provided that collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. The Company primarily provides for no credit terms as it collects a deposit of 50% upon order and requires the remaining 50% be paid before the order is shipped. When credit terms are granted, terms of up to 120 days are provided, based on credit evaluations. Allowances, though not material, has been provided for uncollectible accounts. Management has evaluated the receivables and believes they are collectible based on the nature of the receivables, historical experience of credit losses, and all other currently available evidence. Discounts are recorded as a reduction of the transaction price. Revenue excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales taxes.\nCustomer Advanced Payments\nCustomer advanced payments consists of customer orders paid in advance of the delivery of the order. Customer advanced payments are classified as short-term as the typical order ships within approximately three weeks of placing the order. Customer advanced payments are recognized as revenue when the product is shipped to the customer and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Customer advanced payments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $203,518 (included in discontinued operations) and $522,258 (included in discontinued operations), respectively. Customer advanced payments are included in current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Companys ability to fulfill these orders have been impaired (see Note 1).\nInventories\nThe Company manufactures its own products, made to order, and when completed are shipped to the customer. The Company's inventories are valued by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company had inventories of $0 (included in discontinued operations) and $168,470 (included in discontinued operations), respectively, consisting of mostly finished goods as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 1 for impairment discussion as of December 31, 2021.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally five years. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposition. Fixed assets are examined for the possibility of decreases in value when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist primarily of developed technology - website. Our intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of five years.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe periodically evaluate whether the carrying value of property, equipment and intangible assets has been impaired when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. The carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the discounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value is not recoverable, the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value. There are no impairments as of December 31, 2020. See Note 1 for impairment discussion as of December 31, 2021.\nOur impairment analyses require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows as well as asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets, assessing the probability of different outcomes, and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. If the carrying value is not recoverable, we assess the fair value of long-lived assets using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to, recent third party comparable sales and discounted cash flow models. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to an impairment charge in the future.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception. A lease is a contract that provides the right to control an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. For identified leases, the Company determines whether it should be classified as an operating or finance lease. Operating leases are recorded in the balance sheet as: right-of-use asset (ROU asset) and operating lease obligation. ROU assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease and measured based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The ROU asset also includes deferred rent liabilities. The Companys lease arrangements generally do not provide an implicit interest rate. As a result, in such situations the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option in the measurement of its ROU assets and liabilities. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has some lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease component. See Note 1 for impairment discussion as of December 31, 2021.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe provisions of accounting guidance, FASB Topic ASC 825 requires all entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value, and defines fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and notes payable approximated carrying value due to the short maturity of the instruments, quoted market prices or interest rates which fluctuate with market rates.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, as follows:\n\u00b7 Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\u00b7 Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n\u00b7 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. There were no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. There have been no transfers between levels.\nThe derivatives are evaluated under the hierarchy of ASC 480-10, ASC Paragraph 815-25-1 and ASC Subparagraph 815-10-15-74 addressing embedded derivatives. The fair value of the Level 3 financial instruments was performed internally by the Company using the Black Scholes valuation method.\nThe following table summarize the Companys fair value measurements by level at December 31, 2021 for the assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nSchedule of fair value measurements\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nDerivative liability $ - $ - $ 83,404\nThe following table summarize the Companys fair value measurements by level at December 31, 2020 for the assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nDerivative liability $ - $ - $ 124,180\nDebt\nThe Company issues debt that may have separate warrants, conversion features, or no equity-linked attributes.\nDebt with warrants - When the Company issues debt with warrants, the Company treats the warrants as a debt discount, records them as a contra-liability against the debt, and amortizes the discount over the life of the underlying debt as amortization of debt discount expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. When the warrants require equity treatment under ASC 815, the offset to the contra-liability is recorded as additional paid in capital in our balance sheet. When the Company issues debt with warrants that require liability treatment under ASC 815, such as a clause requiring repricing, the warrants are considered to be a derivative that is recorded as a liability at fair value. If the initial value of the warrant derivative liability is higher than the fair value of the associated debt, the excess is recognized immediately as interest expense. The warrant derivative liability is adjusted to its fair value at the end of each reporting period, with the change being recorded as expense or gain to Other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. If the debt is retired early, the associated debt discount is then recognized immediately as amortization of debt discount expense. The debt is treated as conventional debt.\nConvertible debt - derivative treatment - When the Company issues debt with a conversion feature, we must first assess whether the conversion feature meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative, as follows: a) one or more underlyings, typically the price of our common stock; b) one or more notional amounts or payment provisions or both, generally the number of shares upon conversion; c) no initial net investment, which typically excludes the amount borrowed; and d) net settlement provisions, which in the case of convertible debt generally means the stock received upon conversion can be readily sold for cash. An embedded equity-linked component that meets the definition of a derivative does not have to be separated from the host instrument if the component qualifies for the scope exception for certain contracts involving an issuers own equity. The scope exception applies if the contract is both a) indexed to its own stock; and b) classified in shareholders equity in its statement of financial position.\nIf the conversion feature within convertible debt meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative, we estimate the fair value of the convertible debt derivative using the Black Scholes method upon the date of issuance. If the fair value of the convertible debt derivative is higher than the face value of the convertible debt, the excess is immediately recognized as interest expense. Otherwise, the fair value of the convertible debt derivative is recorded as a liability with an offsetting amount recorded as a debt discount, which offsets the carrying amount of the debt. The convertible debt derivative is revalued at the end of each reporting period and any change in fair value is recorded as a gain or loss in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The debt discount is amortized through interest expense over the life of the debt.\nConvertible debt - beneficial conversion feature - If the conversion feature is not treated as a derivative, we assess whether it is a beneficial conversion feature (BCF). A BCF exists if the conversion price of the convertible debt instrument is less than the stock price on the commitment date. The value of a BCF is equal to the intrinsic value of the feature, the difference between the conversion price and the common stock into which it is convertible and is recorded as additional paid in capital and as a debt discount in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company amortizes the balance over the life of the underlying debt as amortization of debt discount expense in the statement of operations. If the debt is retired early, the associated debt discount is then recognized immediately as amortization of debt discount expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nIf the conversion feature does not qualify for either the derivative treatment or as a BCF, the convertible debt is treated as traditional debt.\nLoss per Share\nThe computation of loss per share included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, represents the net profit (loss) per share that would have been reported had the Company been subject to ASC 260, Earnings Per Share as a corporation for all periods presented.\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share are computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares (including common stock subject to redemption) plus dilutive potential common shares outstanding for the reporting period. In periods where losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.\nThe following potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because the effects were anti-dilutive based on the application of the treasury stock method and because the Company incurred net losses during the period:\nSchedule of antidilutive shares\nDecember 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nOptions to purchase shares of common stock - -\nSeries A convertible preferred stock 500,000,000 500,000,000\nSeries B convertible preferred stock 5,000,000 5,000,000\nSeries C convertible preferred stock 10,000 10,000\nTotal potentially dilutive shares 505,010,000 505,010,000\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company follows ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies, to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. There were no known commitments or contingencies as of December 31, 2020. See Explanatory Note 1 for impairment discussion as of December 31, 2021.\nDiscontinued Operations\nAs a result of the October 14, 2021 Complaint filed against Defendants, the Company determined that Nature would be accounted as a discontinued operation pursuant to ASC 205-20 Discontinued Operations. In determining whether a group of assets that is disposed (or to be disposed) should be presented as a discontinued operation, we analyzed whether the group of assets being disposed represents a component of the Company; that is, whether it had historic operations and cash flows that were clearly distinguished, both operationally and for financial reporting purposes. In addition, we considered whether the disposal represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. The results of discontinued operations, as well as any gain or loss on the disposal, if applicable, are aggregated and separately presented in our consolidated statements of operations, net of income taxes. The historical financial position of discontinued operations are aggregated and separately presented in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nConcentrations, Risks, and Uncertainties\nBusiness Risk\nSubstantial business risks and uncertainties are inherent to an entity, including the potential risk of business failure.\nThe Company is headquartered and operates in the United States. To date, the Company has generated limited revenues from operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully continue to produce its products and failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Also, the success of the Companys operations is subject to numerous contingencies, some of which are beyond managements control. These contingencies include general economic conditions, price of raw material, competition, and governmental and political conditions.\nInterest rate risk\nFinancial assets and liabilities do not have material interest rate risk.\nCredit risk\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk from its cash in banks and accounts receivable. The credit risk on cash in banks is limited because the counterparties are recognized financial institutions.\nSeasonality\nThe business is not subject to seasonal fluctuations. However, as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, in 2020, the Company entered into the sale of KN95 masks but had to dispose of them at a loss.\nMajor Suppliers\nIn producing our supplement products, we source our ingredients from our suppliers on an ongoing as-needed basis. the Company has not entered into any contracts that obligate us to purchase a minimum quantity or exclusively from any food service distributor. Our supplements are manufactured at our facilities in Hollywood, Florida.\nThe Company relies on a variety of suppliers. Should the relationship with an industry vendor be interrupted or discontinued, it is believed that alternate component suppliers could be identified to support the continued advancement of the Company.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. This standard removes, modifies, and adds certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU No. 2018-13 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, coinciding with the standards effective date, and the impact from this standard was immaterial.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This standard simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740, Income Taxes, while also clarifying and amending existing guidance, including interim-period accounting for enacted changes in tax law. This standard is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU No. 2019-12 in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, coinciding with the standards effective date, and the impact from this standard was immaterial.\nAt the beginning of the first quarter of 2021, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Companys condensed consolidated financial statements.\nOther recently issued accounting updates are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 4 - PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following as of:\nSchedule of Property and equipment\nEstimated Life December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nOffice equipment and furniture 5 years $ - $ 21,782\nComputer equipment 3 years - 24,727\nMachinery and equipment 5 years - 17,415\nLeasehold Improvements Shorter of the estimated useful life or lease term - 114,491\nAccumulated depreciation\n- (13,477 )\n$ - $ 164,938\nDepreciation expense was $44,959 and $11,854 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and is classified in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

As consideration for the Ownership Agreement, the Seller received a Promissory Note of $750,000. The Promissory Note bears interest at 15% per annum and matures March 1, 2022, as amended on June 30, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company made repayments of $193,000 for a balance of $72,743 under Due to Related Parties in the accompanying Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021.

The Company has recorded the principal balance due of $0 under Due to Related Parties in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021. The Company received no advances and made repayments of $50,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021. Advances are non-interest bearing and due on demand. See Note 1 for impairment discussion as of December 31, 2021.\nNOTE 7 - LOANS PAYABLE\nEconomic Injury Disaster Loan - Discontinued operations\nOn May 14, 2020, the Company executed the standard loan documents required for securing a loan (the EIDL Loan) from the SBA under its Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) assistance program in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Companys business.\nPursuant to that certain Loan Authorization and Agreement (the SBA Loan Agreement), the Company borrowed an aggregate principal amount of the EIDL Loan of $150,000, with proceeds to be used for working capital purposes. Interest accrues at the rate of 3.75% per annum and will accrue only on funds actually advanced from the date of each advance. Installment payments, including principal and interest, are due monthly beginning May 14, 2021 (twelve months from the date of the SBA Note) in the amount of $731. The balance of principal and interest is payable thirty years from the date of the SBA Note. In connection therewith, the Company also received a $7,000 grant, which does not have to be repaid. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $7,000 was recorded in Other Income in the Statements of Operations in April 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company made repayments of $1,462 and has a balance of $149,490 under short term notes payable in the accompanying Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021.\nIn connection therewith, the Company executed (i) a note for the benefit of the SBA (the SBA Note), which contains customary events of default and (ii) a Security Agreement, granting the SBA a security interest in all tangible and intangible personal property of the Company, which also contains customary events of default (the SBA Security Agreement). As a result of the failure to repay amounts based on the repayment schedule, on December 21, 2021, the Company was notified that it was in default of the EIDL Loan and that the entire balance of principal and unpaid interest of $155,598 is due.\nPaycheck Protection Program Loan - Discontinued operations\nOn May 6, 2020, the Company executed a note (the PPP Note) for the benefit of TD Bank, N.A. (the Lender) in the aggregate amount of $51,065 under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). The PPP is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the SBA). The interest rate of the loan is 1.00% per annum and accrues on the unpaid principal balance computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. Commencing seven months after the effective date of the PPP Note, the Company is required to pay the Lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest as required to fully amortize any unforgiven principal balance of the loan by the two-year anniversary of the effective date of the PPP Note. The PPP Note of $51,065 was repaid in February 2021.\nPaycheck Protection Program Loan Round 2 - Discontinued operations\nOn April 2, 2021, the Company executed a note (the PPP Note) for the benefit of First Federal Bank (the Lender) in the aggregate amount of $200,000 under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) through a second draw.

The conversion shall equal sixty-five percent (65%) of the lowest trading prices for the Common Stock during the twenty (20) day trading period ending on the latest complete trading day prior to the conversion date, representing a discount rate of thirty-five percent (35%).\nOn March 24, 2020, the note obligation of $120,766 held by Emry was partially sold $35,000 of the face amount to the preferred shareholder Saveene. On March 24, 2020, Saveene converted the $35,000 purchase into 5,000 shares into series B and 10,000 shares of series C shares. The face amount of the Company note obligation post the aforementioned conversions and purchases is $85,766 as of December 31, 2021.\nThe Company accounts for an embedded conversion feature as a derivative under ASC 815-10-15-83 and valued separately from the note at fair value. The embedded conversion feature of the note is revalued at each subsequent reporting date at fair value and any changes in fair value will result in a gain or loss in those periods. The Company recorded a derivative liability of $82,257, recorded a change in derivative liability of $40,776 and $21,445 during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAs a result of the failure to timely file our Form 10-Q for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020, the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, the Convertible Notes Payable were in default. The Company is currently in discussions to restructure the terms of the note and recorded default interest of $22,450 and $86,566 during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n$220,000 Note\nOn September 21, 2020, the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $220,000. The convertible promissory note bears interest at 8% per annum and is due and payable in twenty-four (24) months. The holder of this note has the right, at the holder's option, upon the consummation of a sale of all or substantially all of the equity interest in the Company or private placement transaction of the Company's equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, exclusive of the conversion of this note or any similar notes, to convert the principal amount of this note, in whole or in part, plus any interest which accrues hereon, into fully paid and nonassessable shares at a conversion price of $0.05 per share. The Note includes customary events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, covenant breaches, certain representations and warranties, certain events of bankruptcy, liquidation and suspension of the Companys Common Stock from trading. If such an event of default occurs, the holders of the Note may be entitled to take various actions, which may include the acceleration of amounts due under the Note and accrual of interest as described above.\nThe Company analyzed the conversion option in the notes for derivative accounting treatment under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and determined that the instrument does not qualify for derivative accounting. The Company therefore performed an analysis to determine if the conversion option was subject to a beneficial conversion feature (BCF) and determined that the instrument does have a BCF. A BCF exists if the conversion price of the convertible debt instrument is less than the stock price on the commitment date. This typically occurs when the conversion price is less than the fair value of the stock on the date the instrument was issued. The value of a BCF is equal to the intrinsic value of the feature, the difference between the conversion price and the common stock into which it is convertible, and is recorded as additional paid in capital and as a debt discount in the Balance Sheet. As such, the proceeds of the notes were allocated, based on fair values, as $220,000 to the debt discount. The debt discount is accreted over the term of the convertible notes to interest expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe principal balance due at December 31, 2021 is $220,000 and is presented as a short-term liability in the balance sheet.\nAs a result of the failure to timely file our Form 10-Q for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020, the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, the Convertible Notes Payable were in default. On July 19, 2021, the Company entered into a Waiver Agreement (the Agreement) waiving the default provisions listed in the Notes related to the Companys failure to timely file its Form 10-Q for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020, the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the three-month period ended March 31, 2021. In exchange for the Agreement, the Company agreed to pay a one-time interest charge of $11,680 in the year ended December 31, 2021.\n$410,000 Note (previously $600,000)\nOn October 9 and October 16, 2020, the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount totaling $600,000. The convertible promissory note bears interest at 8% per annum and is due and payable in twenty-four (24) months. The holder of this note has the right, at the holder's option, upon the consummation of a sale of all or substantially all of the equity interest in the Company or private placement transaction of the Company's equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, exclusive of the conversion of this note or any similar notes, to convert the principal amount of this note, in whole or in part, plus any interest which accrues hereon, into fully paid and nonassessable shares at a conversion price of $0.05 per share. The Note includes customary events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, covenant breaches, certain representations and warranties, certain events of bankruptcy, liquidation and suspension of the Companys Common Stock from trading. If such an event of default occurs, the holders of the Note may be entitled to take various actions, which may include the acceleration of amounts due under the Note and accrual of interest as described above.\nThe Company analyzed the conversion option in the notes for derivative accounting treatment under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and determined that the instrument does not qualify for derivative accounting.

As such, the proceeds of the notes were allocated, based on fair values, as $600,000 to the debt discount. The debt discount is accreted over the term of the convertible notes to interest expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOn December 6, 2021, the holder of the note converted $190,000 of the Note into 3,800,000 shares of the Companys common stock. The principal balance of $410,000 is due October 16, 2022 and is presented as a short term liability in the balance sheet.\nAs a result of the failure to timely file our Form 10-Q for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020, the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, the Convertible Notes Payable were in default. On July 15, 2021, the Company entered into a Waiver Agreement (the Agreement) waiving the default provisions listed in the Notes related to the Companys failure to timely file its Form 10-Q for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020, the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the three-month period ended March 31, 2021. Therefore, no default interest has been accrued in these financial statements.\nPromissory Debenture\nOn February 15, 2020 and on May 14, 2020, the Company entered into Promissory Agreement and Convertible Debentures (Promissory Debentures) with Emry for a principal sum of $70,000 (which was paid in two tranches: $50,000, paid on February 15, 2020, and $20,000, paid in April 2020) and $48,000 (which was paid in three tranches: $23,000, paid on May 14, 2020, $15,000, paid on May 22, 2020, and $10,000, paid on June 8, 2020), respectively. The Promissory Debentures bear interest, both before and after default, at 15% per month, calculated and compounded monthly. At the election of the holder, at any time during the period between the date of issuance and the one year anniversary of the Promissory Debentures, the Promissory Debentures are convertible into shares of the Companys common stock at a conversion price of $0.001 per share. In addition, the Promissory Debentures provide for an interest equal to 15% of TNRG annual sales, payable on the 2nd day following the date of issuance of the Companys audited financial statements.\nOn June 24, 2020, Emry, holder of (i) Promissory Debentures in principal amount of $70,000 dated February 15, 2020, and (ii) that certain convertible promissory note in principal amount of $85,766 dated April 22, 2019, sold 50% of each (Promissory Debentures and convertible promissory note), including accrued and unpaid interest, fees and penalties, in separate transactions to third party companies, SP11 Capital Investments and E.L.S.R.

On July 15, 2021, the Company entered into a Waiver Agreement (the Agreement) waiving the default provisions listed in the $48,000 note related to the Companys failure to timely file its Form 10-Q for the three month period ended September 30, 2020 and the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $35,000 note provides for no default penalties.\nNOTE 10 - STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nCommon Stock\nThe Company has been authorized to issue 900,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value. Each share of issued and outstanding common stock shall entitle the holder thereof to fully participate in all shareholder meetings, to cast one vote on each matter with respect to which shareholders have the right to vote, and to share ratably in all dividends and other distributions declared and paid with respect to common stock, as well as in the net assets of the corporation upon liquidation or dissolution.\nOn May 14, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company approved Articles of Amendment to the Companys Articles of Incorporation that provided for a 1 for 20 reverse stock-split of the Companys Common Stock.

Our previous Directors, Dr. Ruggero M. Santilli and Mrs. Carla Santilli each own fifty percent of the equity in Hadronic. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has 15 votes per share and is convertible into 10 shares of our common stock at the election of the shareholder. Shares were valued at the par value of the common stock equivalents, $500,000.\nOn January 9, 2020, Mina Mar (the Purchaser) acquired 50,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company from Hadronic. At completion of the stock purchase the Purchaser owns approximately 98.6% of the fully diluted outstanding equity securities of the Company and approximately 99% of the voting rights for the outstanding equity securities. The purchase price of $94,766 for the Preferred Stock was paid by the assumption of a Company note obligation of $85,766 to Emry, with the balance paid in cash. The consideration for the purchase was provided to the Purchaser from the private funds of the principal of the Purchaser.

Class B and class C preferred shares. One class of shares B would be used to offer securitization for the watercraft while class C preferred shares would be used in conjunction with the securitization of air crafts.\nSeries B Convertible Preferred Stock was authorized for 10,000,000 shares of the Company. Each share of Preferred Stock is entitled to one thousand (1,000) votes per share and at the election of the holder converts into one thousand (1,000) shares of Company common stock, so at the completion of the stock purchase, Saveene owns approximately 100% of the fully diluted outstanding equity securities of the Company and approximately 100% of the voting rights for the outstanding equity securities.

The Company has an operating lease for the Companys warehouse and office and accounts for this lease in accordance with ASC 842. Adoption of the standard resulted in the initial recognition of operating lease ROU asset of $344,203 and operating lease liability of $344,203 as of December 31, 2019.\nOperating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Generally, the implicit rate of interest in arrangements is not readily determinable and the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. The Companys incremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on its understanding of what its credit rating would be. The operating lease ROU asset includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our variable lease payments primarily consist of maintenance and other operating expenses from our real estate leases. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. We have elected to account for these lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We are also electing not to apply the recognition requirements to short-term leases of twelve months or less and instead will recognize lease payments as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nIn December 2021, the Company confirmed with the landlord that as of that time and on a going forward basis, the Company has no rental obligation, or past due rental obligation or any other related liability on its office/ warehouse space located at 3017 Greene Street, Hollywood, Florida.\nOn October 22, 2021, the Company entered into a lease termination agreement (Lease Termination) with Canal Park Office to terminate the Companys North Miami Beach, Florida office space. The Termination Agreement allows Canal Park Office to retain the security deposit of $24,799 and to be paid $21,000. The Company was released from any other obligations.\nSee Note 1 for impairment discussion as of December 31, 2021.\nThe components of lease expense and supplemental cash flow information related to leases for the period are as follows:\nSchedule of components of lease expense\nIn accordance with ASC 842, the components of lease expense were as follows:\nYears ended December 31,\nOperating lease expense $ 102,280 $ 182,483\nShort term lease cost $ 4,430 $ 2,472\nTotal lease expense $ 102,280 $ 184,954\nSchedule of other information related to leases\nIn accordance with ASC 842, other information related to leases was as follows:\nYears ended December 31,\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 102,280 $ 177,995\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 102,280 $ 177,995\nWeighted-average remaining lease term-operating leases - 2.4 years\nWeighted-average discount rate-operating leases - 8%\nIn accordance with ASC 842, maturities of operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2021 were as follows:\nSchedule of Reconciliation of lease liabilities\nOperating\nYear ending: Lease\n$ -\nTotal undiscounted cash flows $ -\nReconciliation of lease liabilities:\nWeighted-average remaining lease terms -\nWeighted-average discount rate -\nPresent values $ -\nLease liabilities-current -\nLease liabilities-long-term -\nLease liabilities-total -\nDifference between undiscounted and discounted cash flows $ -\nOperating lease cost was $102,280 and $182,502 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNOTE 12 - Related Party Transactions\nOther than as set forth below, and as disclosed in Notes 6, 8, and 10, there have not been any transaction entered into or been a participant in which a related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.\nOn July 16, 2020, Yogev Shvo, an individual and the member of Nature, entered into a joint venture, Flower Top Wellness LLC, with YCA Group LLC to create four (4) lines of brand name CBD products. The joint venture was terminated on November 11, 2020. The joint venture purchased a total of approximately $150,000 of the Companys products.\nNOTE 13 - INCOME TAXES\nAs a result of the Companys Interest Purchase Agreement, the Company converted to a corporation (Conversion). Beginning on August 14, 2020, the Companys results of operations are taxed as a C Corporation. Prior to the Conversion, the Companys operations were taxed as a limited liability company, whereby the Company elected to be taxed as a partnership and the income or loss was required to be reported by each respective member on their separate income tax returns. Therefore, no provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for periods prior to August 14, 2020.\nAt December 31, 2021, net operating loss carry forwards for Federal and state income tax purposes totaling approximately $495,000 available to reduce future income which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in the year 2040. There is no income tax affect due to the recognition of a full valuation allowance on the expected tax benefits of future loss carry forwards based on uncertainty surrounding realization of such assets.\nA reconciliation of the statutory income tax rates and the effective tax rate is as follows:\nSchedule of income tax expense\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nStatutory U.S. federal rate 21.0% 21.0%\nState income tax, net of federal benefit 3.5% 3.5%\nPermanent differences 0.0% 0.0%\nValuation allowance (24.5)% (24.5)%\nProvision for income taxes 0.0% 0.0%\nThe tax effects of the temporary differences and carry forwards that give rise to deferred tax assets consist of the following:\nSchedule of deferred income taxes\nDecember 31,\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss carry forwards $ 495,455 $ 323,940\nStock based compensation - -\nValuation allowance (495,455 ) (323,940 )\nDeferred tax asset, net $ - $ -\nMajor tax jurisdictions are the United States and Florida. All of the tax years will remain open three and four years for examination by the Federal and state tax authorities, respectively, from the date of utilization of the net operating loss. There are no tax audits pending.\nNOTE 14 - EARNINGS PER SHARE\nFASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share, requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (EPS) computations.\nBasic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. In periods where losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.\nBasic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same since net losses for all periods presented and including the additional potential common shares would have an anti-dilutive effect.\nThe following potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because the effects were anti-dilutive based on the application of the treasury stock method and because the Company incurred net losses during the period:\nSchedule of anti dilutive shares\nYears Ended December 31,\nSeries A convertible preferred stock 500,000,000 500,000,000\nSeries B convertible preferred stock 5,000,000 5,000,000\nSeries C convertible preferred stock 10,000 10,000\nTotal potentially dilutive shares 505,010,000 505,010,000\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share:\nSchedule of earning per share\nYears Ended December 31,\nLoss from continuing operations $ (1,136,288 ) $ (505,973 )\nDiscontinued operations (236,262 ) (44,629 )\nNet loss attributable to the common stockholders $ (1,372,550 ) $ (550,602 )\nBasic weighted average outstanding shares of common stock 76,735,271 35,787,669\nDilutive effect of options and warrants - -\nDiluted weighted average common stock and common stock equivalents 76,735,271 35,787,669\nLoss per share:\nNet loss per share from continuing operations, basic and diluted $ (0.02 ) $ (0.02 )\nNet loss per share from discontinued operations, basic and diluted (0.00 ) (0.00 )\nNet loss per share total, basic and diluted $ (0.02 ) $ (0.02 )\nNOTE 15 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal\nFrom time to time, various lawsuits and legal proceedings may arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these, or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any legal proceedings or claims that it believes will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or operating results except:\nFirst Capital Venture\nOn November 3, 2020, First Capital Venture Co., a subsidiary of the client, d/b/a Diamond CBD, filed a civil complaint against Thunder Energies Corporation (the Defendants), in the pending 17th Judicial Circuit Court in and for Broward County, Florida, (the Florida Court), Case Number CACE-20-019111 (the Complaint).\nOn January 26, 2021 Plaintiffs were erroneously granted an Order of Default to which the Defendants immediately pointed out to the Court and on February 23, 2021 an Order Vacating the Default was granted in favor of the Defendants. The Plaintiff knew, or should have known, that the Order of Default was not valid but they proceeded on February 9, 2021 to publish false and misleading press releases.\nThunder Energies Corporation is proceeding through discovery and is of the belief the suit will be decided in their favor. A pending Motion to Dismiss is before the Court. Plaintiffs Complaint is based on a claim for tortious interference and misappropriation of trade secrets. Neither claim is supported by the Complaint.\nThunder Energies Corporation has issued a cease and desist to the Plaintiff and is considering a counter claim concerning the false information and disclosures made by the Plaintiff that may have affected the Companys business and shareholders.\nThe Company is unable to predict the financial outcome of this matter at this time, and any views formed as to the viability of these claims or the financial exposure which could result may change from time to time as the matter proceeds through its course. Accordingly, adjustments, if any, that might result from the resolution of this matter have not been reflected in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is confident to obtain a summary judgement in their favor on the trade secret allegations and hence has not provided for any financial exposure. However, no assurance can be made that this matter together with the potential for reputational harm, will not result in a material financial exposure, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRocket Systems - Discontinued Operations\nOn October 13, 2021, Rocket Systems, Inc. (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Nature Consulting LLC (Nature) in the pending 17th Judicial Circuit Court in and for Broward County, Florida, (the Florida Court), Case Number CACE-21-018840 (the Complaint).\nThe complaint alleges that the Plaintiff paid Nature a deposit of $50,000 for the delivery of Nature products. According to the Complaint, Nature delivered $6,188 of the product but failed to deliver the remaining $43,812 of product.\nPlaintiff has demanded that the remainder of the product order be canceled and the refund of $43,812.
